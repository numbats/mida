## Project

[Project instructions](project/project-instructions.html) and
[project groups](./groups.html). Please check the project groups
for any discrepancies. 

- **Deadline 1 (13th May)**:  Find team members, and potential topics to study (List of groups will be posted [here](./groups.html))
- **Deadline 2 (20th May)**:  Team members and team name, data description.
- **Deadline 3 (29th May) **:  Electronic copy of your data, and a page of data description, and cleaning done, or needing to be done.
- **Deadline 4 (3rd June) **:  Final version of story board uploaded.

- **Presentation in week 12**

There are several ways to do the storyboard:
  - [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) package, and there is an [example here](project/electricity-webstory.zip) that contains code for a complete dashboard
	- A basic [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) app
	- slides with the [xaringan](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) package
	- a [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html) tutorial, example project [here](project/pisa_au_app.zip).

## Practical Exam

The exam will be conducted in week 11. These are similar in presentation
to assignments but you have a shorter amount of time to complete them. You
will be given an Rmd file and some data. Inside the Rmd are questions
to help guide you through a data analysis.

You are expected to answer all of the questions inside the Rmd, and then submit
both the Rmd and compiled html file to ED within 24 hours. In previous versions
of the course the exam has taken students about 60 minutes to 90 minutes to complete.
