# Announcements

- Assignment 2: due 20th May at 5pm

- Project deadlines:
  - **Milestone 2 (20th May) **: Finalised team/team members,
  a paragraph about what you're going to do and links to your data sources.

# And as an association matrix

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

---
# Why care about these relationships?

- **Telephone exchanges**: Nodes are the phone numbers. Edges would indicate a call was made betwen two numbers.
- **Book or movie plots**: Nodes are the characters. Edges would indicate whether they appear together in a scene, or chapter. If they speak to each other, various ways we might measure the association.
- **Social media**: nodes would be the people who post on facebook, including comments. Edges would measure who  comments on who's posts.

---
# Drawing these relationships out:

One way to describe these relationships is to provide association matrix between many objects. 

```{r draw-association, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}

# Generate a network view

- Create a layout (in 2D) which places nodes which are most related close,
- Plot the nodes as points, connect the appropriate lines
- Overlaying other aspects, e.g. gender

---
# introducing `madmen` data

```{r make-madmen-graph}
glimpse(madmen)
```

---
# Nodes and edges?

Network data can be thought of as two related tables, **nodes** and **edges**:

- **nodes** are connection points
- **edges** are the connections between points

---
# Example: Mad Men. (Nodes = characters from the series)

```{r mm-nodes}
madmen_nodes
```

---
# Example: Mad Men. (Edges = how they are associated)

```{r mm-edges}
madmen_edges
```

---
# Let's get the madmen data into the right shape

```{r}
madmen_edges %>%
  rename(from_id = Name1, to_id = Name2) 
```

---
# Let's get the madmen data into the right shape

```{r}
madmen_net <- madmen_edges %>%
  rename(from_id = Name1, to_id = Name2) %>%
  full_join(madmen_nodes,  #<<
            by = c("from_id" = "label")) #<<

Fall 2000 Season of [Division I college football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I). 
- Nodes are the teams, edges are the matches. 
- Teams are broken into "conferences" which are the primary competition, but they can play outside this group.

# What do we learn?

- Remember layout is done to place nodes that are more similar close together in the display. 
- The colours indicate conference the team belongs too. For the most part, conferences are clustered, more similar to each other than other conferences. 
- There are some clusters of conference groups, eg Mid-American, Big East, and Atlantic Coast
- The Independents are independent
- Some teams play far afield from their conference.

# Summary 


- To make a network analysis, you need:
    - an association matrix, that describes how nodes (vertices) are connected to each other
    - a layout algorithm to place the nodes optimally so that the fewest edges cross, or that the nodes that are most closely associated are near to each other.

---
class: refresher
# Quantitative association matrices

Previous association matrices were black and white: 

```{r show-network-data, out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("images/network_data.png")
```

---
class: refresher
# Quantitative association matrices

- You could have the association between nodes described as real numbers.

--

- E.g., these are the number of times that these people called each other in the last week:

```{r show-n-times-ppl-called, echo = FALSE}
d <- matrix(c(0, 5, 4, 1, 1, 
              5, 0, 4, 2, 1,
              4, 4, 0, 0, 0,
              1, 2, 0, 0, 6,
              1, 1, 0, 6, 0), ncol=5, byrow=T)
colnames(d) <- c("Meg", "Tay", "Yat", "Zili", "Jess")
rownames(d) <- colnames(d)
kable(d)
```

---
# Quantitative association matrices

We would need to turn this into an edge data set:

```{r show-edges, echo=FALSE}
d_edges <- d %>% as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(from = rownames(d)) %>%
  gather(to, count, -from)
d_edges
```

---
# Quantitative association matrices

- We need to decide what corresponds to a "connection".
- Let's say they need to have called each other at least 4 times, to be considered connected.


```{r decide-connections, echo = TRUE}
d_edges_filter <- d_edges %>% filter(count > 3)
```

```{r decide-connections-print, echo = TRUE}

# Data:  Last 2018, 4 months of currency USD cross-rates

SO let's try this with cross-currency rates across the globe!

- Data extracted from http://openexchangerates.org/api/historical
- R packages `jsonlite`, processed with `tidyverse`, `lubridate`

---
# Data:  Last 4 months of currency USD cross-rates

```{r show-rates, echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
rates <- read_csv(here::here("slides/data/rates_new.csv"))

rates %>% head()
```

---
# Data:  Last 4 months of currency USD cross-rates

```{r plot-rates, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
p1 <- ggplot(rates, aes(x=date, y=AUD)) + geom_line()
p2 <- ggplot(rates, aes(x=date, y=EUR)) + geom_line()
p3 <- ggplot(rates, aes(x=date, y=JPY)) + geom_line()
p4 <- rates %>% select(date, AUD, EUR, JPY) %>%
  gather(curr, value, -date) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, colour=curr, group=curr)) + 
    geom_line() + theme(legend.position="none") +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette="Dark2")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

---
# Your turn: Rstudio

Make some plots (or google) to answer these questions

- Is the NZD more similar to AUD, EUR, or JPY? (What currency is NZD?)
- Is SGD more similar to AUD, EUR, or JPY? (What currency is SGD?)
- How many currencies are there in the British Isles? 

---

```{r show-many-currencies, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}

# Pre-processing: Keep currencies that change

- Some currencies don't change very much. 
- These should be filtered from the analysis, because in a study of currency movement, if it doesn't move then there is nothing more to be said. 

---
# Pre-processing: Keep currencies that change

- To filter out these currencies we use a statistic called [coefficient of variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation):

$$
Coef Variation = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}
$$

--

- Measures standard deviation of currency relative to the mean. 
- For high means, we expect a currency to change more. 
- That is, relatively the standard deviation would be larger to consider it to be changing.

---

# Computing CV

### Stratgey pivot to long form then group and summarize currency values

```{r}
# Compute coefficient of variation. We will only analyse 
# currencies that have changes substantially over this time.
cv <- function(x){
  sd(x)/mean(x)
}

rates_cv <- rates %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -date, names_to = "currency") %>% 
  group_by(currency) %>% 
  summarise(cv = cv(value)) 
```

---

## Distrubtion of CV values

```{r cv-histogram, echo = FALSE}
rates_cv %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cv)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```

---

# Filter out currencies if they have CVs below the first quantile

```{r low-quantile}
rates_stable <- rates_cv %>%
  filter(cv < quantile(cv, 0.25))
```

---

# Filter out low cv currencies using pivot and an anti join

```{r anti-low-cv}
rates_sub <- rates %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -date, names_to = "currency") %>% 
  anti_join(rates_stable)
rates_sub
```

---
# Remove currencies that are not currencies

Some of the currencies ... aren't really currencies. Google these ones: XAG, XDR, XPT - what are they?

---
# Remove currencies that are not currencies

```{r}
# Remove non-currencies
rates_dropped <- rates_sub %>% 
  filter(!currency %in% c("ALL", "XAG", "XDR", "XPT"))
```

XAG is Gold
XPT is Platinum
XDR is special drawing rights

---
# Standardize the currencies

To examine overall trend regardless of actual USD cross rate, standardise the values to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.


```{r scale-fun}
scale01 <- function(x) (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
```

---
# Rescale all values to have standardised values

##  Use `group_by()` plus `mutate()`!

--
```{r rescale-rates}
rates_scaled <- rates_dropped %>%
  group_by(currency) %>% 
  mutate(value = scale01(value))
```

---
# Standardize the currencies

```{r currencies-standardized, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}

# Compute distances between all pairs of currencies

Euclidean distance is used to compute similarity between all pairs of currencies. 

$d_{ij} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{t}{(C_{1i}-C_{2i})^2}}$

---
# Compute distances between all pairs of currencies

We need to put our data back in wide form! And then turn it
into a matrix.

# A note on distance matrices:

- A distance matrix is the inverse of an association matrix. 
- A distance matrix close to 0 means the pair are most similar. 
- For an association matrix far from zero means the pair are close. 
- Either can be used to generate a network.

# Your turn

- Make a plot of the AUD vs the SGD (using the standardised units). Do they look like they are trending together as suggested by the network?
- Try out the remaining lab exercises
