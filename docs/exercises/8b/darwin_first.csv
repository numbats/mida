1228,ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
1228,
1228,
1228,
1228,
1228,INTRODUCTION.
1228,
1228,"When on board H.M.S. 'Beagle,' as naturalist, I was much struck with"
1228,"certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America,"
1228,and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants
1228,of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the
1228,"origin of species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by"
1228,"one of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me,"
1228,"in , that something might perhaps be made out on this question by"
1228,patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could
1228,possibly have any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself
1228,"to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I"
1228,"enlarged in  into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to"
1228,me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued
1228,the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these
1228,"personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in"
1228,coming to a decision.
1228,
1228,My work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more
1228,"years to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been"
1228,urged to publish this Abstract. I have more especially been induced to
1228,"do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of"
1228,"the Malay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general"
1228,conclusions that I have on the origin of species. Last year he sent to
1228,"me a memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it"
1228,"to Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is"
1228,published in the third volume of the Journal of that Society. Sir C.
1228,"Lyell and Dr. Hooker, who both knew of my work--the latter having read"
1228,"my sketch of --honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with"
1228,"Mr. Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts."
1228,
1228,"This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I"
1228,cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements;
1228,and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy.
1228,"No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been"
1228,cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. I can here give only
1228,"the general conclusions at which I have arrived, with a few facts in"
1228,"illustration, but which, I hope, in most cases will suffice. No one can"
1228,feel more sensible than I do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in
1228,"detail all the facts, with references, on which my conclusions have been"
1228,grounded; and I hope in a future work to do this. For I am well aware
1228,that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts
1228,"cannot be adduced, often apparently leading to conclusions directly"
1228,opposite to those at which I have arrived. A fair result can be obtained
1228,only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both
1228,sides of each question; and this cannot possibly be here done.
1228,
1228,I much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of
1228,acknowledging the generous assistance which I have received from very
1228,"many naturalists, some of them personally unknown to me. I cannot,"
1228,"however, let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep"
1228,"obligations to Dr. Hooker, who for the last fifteen years has aided me"
1228,in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent
1228,judgment.
1228,
1228,"In considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that a"
1228,"naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings,"
1228,"on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution,"
1228,"geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the"
1228,"conclusion that each species had not been independently created, but"
1228,"had descended, like varieties, from other species. Nevertheless, such"
1228,"a conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it"
1228,could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world
1228,"have been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and"
1228,coadaptation which most justly excites our admiration. Naturalists
1228,"continually refer to external conditions, such as climate, food, etc.,"
1228,"as the only possible cause of variation. In one very limited sense,"
1228,"as we shall hereafter see, this may be true; but it is preposterous to"
1228,"attribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance,"
1228,"of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably"
1228,adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees. In the case of the
1228,"misseltoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees, which has"
1228,"seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has flowers"
1228,with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects
1228,"to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally preposterous"
1228,"to account for the structure of this parasite, with its relations to"
1228,"several distinct organic beings, by the effects of external conditions,"
1228,"or of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself."
1228,
1228,"The author of the 'Vestiges of Creation' would, I presume, say that,"
1228,"after a certain unknown number of generations, some bird had given birth"
1228,"to a woodpecker, and some plant to the misseltoe, and that these had"
1228,been produced perfect as we now see them; but this assumption seems to
1228,"me to be no explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of"
1228,"organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life,"
1228,untouched and unexplained.
1228,
1228,"It is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into"
1228,the means of modification and coadaptation. At the commencement of
1228,my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of
1228,domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best
1228,chance of making out this obscure problem. Nor have I been disappointed;
1228,in this and in all other perplexing cases I have invariably found that
1228,"our knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication,"
1228,afforded the best and safest clue. I may venture to express my
1228,"conviction of the high value of such studies, although they have been"
1228,very commonly neglected by naturalists.
1228,
1228,"From these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this"
1228,Abstract to Variation under Domestication. We shall thus see that a
1228,"large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible, and, what"
1228,"is equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man"
1228,in accumulating by his Selection successive slight variations. I will
1228,then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature; but
1228,"I shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too"
1228,"briefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of"
1228,"facts. We shall, however, be enabled to discuss what circumstances"
1228,are most favourable to variation. In the next chapter the Struggle
1228,"for Existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world, which"
1228,"inevitably follows from their high geometrical powers of increase, will"
1228,"be treated of. This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole"
1228,animal and vegetable kingdoms. As many more individuals of each species
1228,"are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a"
1228,"frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being,"
1228,"if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under"
1228,"the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better"
1228,"chance of surviving, and thus be NATURALLY SELECTED. From the strong"
1228,"principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate"
1228,its new and modified form.
1228,
1228,This fundamental subject of Natural Selection will be treated at
1228,some length in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how Natural
1228,Selection almost inevitably causes much Extinction of the less improved
1228,forms of life and induces what I have called Divergence of Character.
1228,In the next chapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws of
1228,"variation and of correlation of growth. In the four succeeding chapters,"
1228,the most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given:
1228,"namely, first, the difficulties of transitions, or in understanding how"
1228,a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a
1228,highly developed being or elaborately constructed organ; secondly
1228,"the subject of Instinct, or the mental powers of animals, thirdly,"
1228,"Hybridism, or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties"
1228,"when intercrossed; and fourthly, the imperfection of the Geological"
1228,Record. In the next chapter I shall consider the geological succession
1228,"of organic beings throughout time; in the eleventh and twelfth, their"
1228,"geographical distribution throughout space; in the thirteenth, their"
1228,"classification or mutual affinities, both when mature and in an"
1228,embryonic condition. In the last chapter I shall give a brief
1228,"recapitulation of the whole work, and a few concluding remarks."
1228,
1228,No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in
1228,"regard to the origin of species and varieties, if he makes due allowance"
1228,for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all
1228,the beings which live around us. Who can explain why one species ranges
1228,"widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow"
1228,"range and is rare? Yet these relations are of the highest importance,"
1228,"for they determine the present welfare, and, as I believe, the future"
1228,success and modification of every inhabitant of this world. Still less
1228,do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the
1228,world during the many past geological epochs in its history. Although
1228,"much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no"
1228,"doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of"
1228,"which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists entertain,"
1228,"and which I formerly entertained--namely, that each species has been"
1228,independently created--is erroneous. I am fully convinced that species
1228,are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the
1228,same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct
1228,"species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one"
1228,"species are the descendants of that species. Furthermore, I am convinced"
1228,that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of
1228,modification.

1228,
1228,When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of
1228,"our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which"
1228,"strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other,"
1228,than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of
1228,nature. When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals
1228,"which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under"
1228,"the most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to"
1228,conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic
1228,productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform
1228,"as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have"
1228,"been exposed under nature. There is, also, I think, some probability"
1228,"in the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that this variability may be"
1228,partly connected with excess of food. It seems pretty clear that organic
1228,beings must be exposed during several generations to the new conditions
1228,of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation; and that when the
1228,"organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues to vary for"
1228,many generations. No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be
1228,"variable under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat,"
1228,still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are
1228,still capable of rapid improvement or modification.
1228,
1228,"It has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability,"
1228,"whatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late"
1228,"period of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception."
1228,Geoffroy St. Hilaire's experiments show that unnatural treatment of the
1228,embryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by
1228,any clear line of distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly
1228,inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may
1228,be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been
1228,affected prior to the act of conception. Several reasons make me believe
1228,in this; but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement or
1228,cultivation has on the functions of the reproductive system; this
1228,system appearing to be far more susceptible than any other part of the
1228,"organisation, to the action of any change in the conditions of life."
1228,"Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more"
1228,"difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even in the"
1228,many cases when the male and female unite. How many animals there
1228,"are which will not breed, though living long under not very close"
1228,confinement in their native country! This is generally attributed to
1228,vitiated instincts; but how many cultivated plants display the utmost
1228,"vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few such cases it has"
1228,"been found out that very trifling changes, such as a little more or less"
1228,"water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or not"
1228,the plant sets a seed. I cannot here enter on the copious details which
1228,I have collected on this curious subject; but to show how singular the
1228,"laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement,"
1228,"I may just mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics,"
1228,"breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with the"
1228,"exception of the plantigrades or bear family; whereas, carnivorous"
1228,"birds, with the rarest exceptions, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many"
1228,"exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same exact"
1228,"condition as in the most sterile hybrids. When, on the one hand, we"
1228,"see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, yet"
1228,"breeding quite freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand,"
1228,"we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature,"
1228,"perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous"
1228,"instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected"
1228,"by unperceived causes as to fail in acting, we need not be surprised"
1228,"at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting not quite"
1228,"regularly, and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents or"
1228,variable.
1228,
1228,Sterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture; but on this
1228,view we owe variability to the same cause which produces sterility; and
1228,variability is the source of all the choicest productions of the garden.
1228,"I may add, that as some organisms will breed most freely under the"
1228,"most unnatural conditions (for instance, the rabbit and ferret kept"
1228,"in hutches), showing that their reproductive system has not been thus"
1228,affected; so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or
1228,"cultivation, and vary very slightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state"
1228,of nature.
1228,
1228,"A long list could easily be given of ""sporting plants;"" by this term"
1228,"gardeners mean a single bud or offset, which suddenly assumes a new and"
1228,sometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant.
1228,"Such buds can be propagated by grafting, etc., and sometimes by seed."
1228,"These ""sports"" are extremely rare under nature, but far from rare under"
1228,cultivation; and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent
1228,"has affected a bud or offset, and not the ovules or pollen. But it is"
1228,the opinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference
1228,between a bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation; so
1228,"that, in fact, ""sports"" support my view, that variability may be largely"
1228,"attributed to the ovules or pollen, or to both, having been affected by"
1228,the treatment of the parent prior to the act of conception. These cases
1228,"anyhow show that variation is not necessarily connected, as some authors"
1228,"have supposed, with the act of generation."
1228,
1228,"Seedlings from the same fruit, and the young of the same litter,"
1228,"sometimes differ considerably from each other, though both the young"
1228,"and the parents, as Muller has remarked, have apparently been exposed to"
1228,exactly the same conditions of life; and this shows how unimportant the
1228,direct effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws
1228,"of reproduction, and of growth, and of inheritance; for had the action"
1228,"of the conditions been direct, if any of the young had varied, all would"
1228,"probably have varied in the same manner. To judge how much, in the case"
1228,"of any variation, we should attribute to the direct action of heat,"
1228,"moisture, light, food, etc., is most difficult: my impression is, that"
1228,"with animals such agencies have produced very little direct effect,"
1228,"though apparently more in the case of plants. Under this point of view,"
1228,Mr. Buckman's recent experiments on plants seem extremely valuable.
1228,When all or nearly all the individuals exposed to certain conditions are
1228,"affected in the same way, the change at first appears to be directly"
1228,due to such conditions; but in some cases it can be shown that quite
1228,opposite conditions produce similar changes of structure. Nevertheless
1228,"some slight amount of change may, I think, be attributed to the direct"
1228,"action of the conditions of life--as, in some cases, increased size from"
1228,"amount of food, colour from particular kinds of food and from light, and"
1228,perhaps the thickness of fur from climate.
1228,
1228,"Habit also has a decided influence, as in the period of flowering with"
1228,plants when transported from one climate to another. In animals it has
1228,"a more marked effect; for instance, I find in the domestic duck that"
1228,"the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more,"
1228,"in proportion to the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the"
1228,wild-duck; and I presume that this change may be safely attributed to
1228,"the domestic duck flying much less, and walking more, than its wild"
1228,parent. The great and inherited development of the udders in cows and
1228,"goats in countries where they are habitually milked, in comparison with"
1228,"the state of these organs in other countries, is another instance of the"
1228,effect of use. Not a single domestic animal can be named which has not
1228,"in some country drooping ears; and the view suggested by some authors,"
1228,"that the drooping is due to the disuse of the muscles of the ear, from"
1228,"the animals not being much alarmed by danger, seems probable."
1228,
1228,"There are many laws regulating variation, some few of which can be dimly"
1228,"seen, and will be hereafter briefly mentioned. I will here only allude"
1228,to what may be called correlation of growth. Any change in the embryo
1228,or larva will almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal. In
1228,"monstrosities, the correlations between quite distinct parts are very"
1228,curious; and many instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire's
1228,great work on this subject. Breeders believe that long limbs are almost
1228,always accompanied by an elongated head. Some instances of correlation
1228,are quite whimsical; thus cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf;
1228,"colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many"
1228,remarkable cases could be given amongst animals and plants. From the
1228,"facts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are"
1228,differently affected from coloured individuals by certain vegetable
1228,poisons. Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and
1228,"coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many"
1228,horns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes;
1228,"pigeons with short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks"
1228,"large feet. Hence, if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any"
1228,"peculiarity, he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts"
1228,"of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of"
1228,growth.
1228,
1228,"The result of the various, quite unknown, or dimly seen laws of"
1228,variation is infinitely complex and diversified. It is well worth while
1228,carefully to study the several treatises published on some of our old
1228,"cultivated plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, etc.;"
1228,and it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure and
1228,constitution in which the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly
1228,"from each other. The whole organisation seems to have become plastic,"
1228,and tends to depart in some small degree from that of the parental type.
1228,
1228,Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. But the
1228,"number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both"
1228,"those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance,"
1228,"is endless. Dr. Prosper Lucas's treatise, in two large volumes, is the"
1228,fullest and the best on this subject. No breeder doubts how strong
1228,is the tendency to inheritance: like produces like is his fundamental
1228,belief: doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writers
1228,"alone. When a deviation appears not unfrequently, and we see it in the"
1228,"father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same"
1228,"original cause acting on both; but when amongst individuals, apparently"
1228,"exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some"
1228,"extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent--say,"
1228,once amongst several million individuals--and it reappears in the
1228,"child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute"
1228,its reappearance to inheritance. Every one must have heard of cases of
1228,"albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, etc., appearing in several members"
1228,of the same family. If strange and rare deviations of structure are
1228,"truly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely"
1228,admitted to be inheritable. Perhaps the correct way of viewing the
1228,"whole subject, would be, to look at the inheritance of every character"
1228,"whatever as the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly."
1228,
1228,The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown; no one can say why the
1228,"same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species, and in"
1228,"individuals of different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes"
1228,not so; why the child often reverts in certain characters to its
1228,grandfather or grandmother or other much more remote ancestor; why a
1228,peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes or to one
1228,"sex alone, more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex. It is a"
1228,"fact of some little importance to us, that peculiarities appearing"
1228,in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted either
1228,"exclusively, or in a much greater degree, to males alone. A much more"
1228,"important rule, which I think may be trusted, is that, at whatever"
1228,"period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to appear in the"
1228,"offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier. In many"
1228,cases this could not be otherwise: thus the inherited peculiarities
1228,in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly
1228,mature; peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the
1228,corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage. But hereditary diseases and
1228,"some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension,"
1228,and that when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should
1228,"appear at any particular age, yet that it does tend to appear in the"
1228,offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent. I
1228,believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the
1228,laws of embryology. These remarks are of course confined to the first
1228,"APPEARANCE of the peculiarity, and not to its primary cause, which may"
1228,have acted on the ovules or male element; in nearly the same manner as
1228,"in the crossed offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull,"
1228,"the greater length of horn, though appearing late in life, is clearly"
1228,due to the male element.
1228,
1228,"Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to"
1228,"a statement often made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic"
1228,"varieties, when run wild, gradually but certainly revert in character to"
1228,their aboriginal stocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions can
1228,be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature. I have in
1228,vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement
1228,has so often and so boldly been made. There would be great difficulty
1228,in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many of the most
1228,strongly-marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild
1228,"state. In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was, and"
1228,so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued.
1228,"It would be quite necessary, in order to prevent the effects of"
1228,"intercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in"
1228,"its new home. Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally"
1228,"revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me"
1228,"not improbable, that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to"
1228,"cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance,"
1228,"of the cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some effect"
1228,"would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil),"
1228,"that they would to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild"
1228,"aboriginal stock. Whether or not the experiment would succeed, is not of"
1228,great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment itself
1228,the conditions of life are changed. If it could be shown that our
1228,"domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion,--that"
1228,"is, to lose their acquired characters, whilst kept under unchanged"
1228,"conditions, and whilst kept in a considerable body, so that free"
1228,"intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations"
1228,"of structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from"
1228,domestic varieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow of
1228,evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed
1228,"our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of"
1228,"various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an almost infinite number"
1228,"of generations, would be opposed to all experience. I may add, that when"
1228,"under nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions"
1228,"of character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter"
1228,"be explained, will determine how far the new characters thus arising"
1228,shall be preserved.
1228,
1228,When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic
1228,"animals and plants, and compare them with species closely allied"
1228,"together, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already"
1228,"remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic"
1228,"races of the same species, also, often have a somewhat monstrous"
1228,"character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other,"
1228,"and from the other species of the same genus, in several trifling"
1228,"respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both"
1228,"when compared one with another, and more especially when compared with"
1228,all the species in nature to which they are nearest allied. With these
1228,exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when
1228,"crossed,--a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic races of the"
1228,"same species differ from each other in the same manner as, only in most"
1228,"cases in a lesser degree than, do closely-allied species of the same"
1228,"genus in a state of nature. I think this must be admitted, when we find"
1228,"that there are hardly any domestic races, either amongst animals or"
1228,"plants, which have not been ranked by some competent judges as"
1228,"mere varieties, and by other competent judges as the descendants of"
1228,aboriginally distinct species. If any marked distinction existed
1228,"between domestic races and species, this source of doubt could not so"
1228,perpetually recur. It has often been stated that domestic races do not
1228,differ from each other in characters of generic value. I think it could
1228,be shown that this statement is hardly correct; but naturalists differ
1228,most widely in determining what characters are of generic value; all
1228,"such valuations being at present empirical. Moreover, on the view of"
1228,"the origin of genera which I shall presently give, we have no right"
1228,to expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticated
1228,productions.
1228,
1228,When we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between
1228,"the domestic races of the same species, we are soon involved in doubt,"
1228,from not knowing whether they have descended from one or several
1228,"parent-species. This point, if it could be cleared up, would be"
1228,"interesting; if, for instance, it could be shown that the greyhound,"
1228,"bloodhound, terrier, spaniel, and bull-dog, which we all know propagate"
1228,"their kind so truly, were the offspring of any single species, then such"
1228,facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability
1228,"of the many very closely allied and natural species--for instance, of"
1228,the many foxes--inhabiting different quarters of the world. I do not
1228,"believe, as we shall presently see, that all our dogs have descended"
1228,"from any one wild species; but, in the case of some other domestic"
1228,"races, there is presumptive, or even strong, evidence in favour of this"
1228,view.
1228,
1228,It has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals
1228,"and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and"
1228,likewise to withstand diverse climates. I do not dispute that these
1228,capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated
1228,"productions; but how could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed"
1228,"an animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and whether"
1228,it would endure other climates? Has the little variability of the ass or
1228,"guinea-fowl, or the small power of endurance of warmth by the rein-deer,"
1228,"or of cold by the common camel, prevented their domestication? I"
1228,"cannot doubt that if other animals and plants, equal in number to our"
1228,"domesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and"
1228,"countries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to breed"
1228,"for an equal number of generations under domestication, they would"
1228,vary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existing
1228,domesticated productions have varied.
1228,
1228,"In the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants, I"
1228,"do not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether"
1228,they have descended from one or several species. The argument mainly
1228,relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic
1228,"animals is, that we find in the most ancient records, more especially on"
1228,"the monuments of Egypt, much diversity in the breeds; and that some of"
1228,"the breeds closely resemble, perhaps are identical with, those still"
1228,existing. Even if this latter fact were found more strictly and
1228,"generally true than seems to me to be the case, what does it show, but"
1228,"that some of our breeds originated there, four or five thousand years"
1228,ago? But Mr. Horner's researches have rendered it in some degree
1228,probable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery
1228,existed in the valley of the Nile thirteen or fourteen thousand years
1228,"ago; and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods,"
1228,"savages, like those of Tierra del Fuego or Australia, who possess a"
1228,"semi-domestic dog, may not have existed in Egypt?"
1228,
1228,"The whole subject must, I think, remain vague; nevertheless, I may,"
1228,"without here entering on any details, state that, from geographical and"
1228,"other considerations, I think it highly probable that our domestic dogs"
1228,have descended from several wild species. In regard to sheep and goats
1228,"I can form no opinion. I should think, from facts communicated to me by"
1228,"Mr. Blyth, on the habits, voice, and constitution, etc., of the humped"
1228,"Indian cattle, that these had descended from a different aboriginal"
1228,stock from our European cattle; and several competent judges believe
1228,that these latter have had more than one wild parent. With respect to
1228,"horses, from reasons which I cannot give here, I am doubtfully inclined"
1228,"to believe, in opposition to several authors, that all the races have"
1228,"descended from one wild stock. Mr. Blyth, whose opinion, from his large"
1228,"and varied stores of knowledge, I should value more than that of almost"
1228,"any one, thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded from"
1228,the common wild Indian fowl (Gallus bankiva). In regard to ducks and
1228,"rabbits, the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in"
1228,"structure, I do not doubt that they all have descended from the common"
1228,wild duck and rabbit.
1228,
1228,The doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several
1228,"aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some"
1228,"authors. They believe that every race which breeds true, let the"
1228,"distinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype."
1228,At this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild
1228,"cattle, as many sheep, and several goats in Europe alone, and several"
1228,even within Great Britain. One author believes that there formerly
1228,existed in Great Britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it!
1228,"When we bear in mind that Britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal,"
1228,"and France but few distinct from those of Germany and conversely, and"
1228,"so with Hungary, Spain, etc., but that each of these kingdoms possesses"
1228,"several peculiar breeds of cattle, sheep, etc., we must admit that many"
1228,domestic breeds have originated in Europe; for whence could they have
1228,"been derived, as these several countries do not possess a number of"
1228,peculiar species as distinct parent-stocks? So it is in India. Even in
1228,"the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world, which I fully admit"
1228,"have probably descended from several wild species, I cannot doubt that"
1228,there has been an immense amount of inherited variation. Who can believe
1228,"that animals closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound,"
1228,"the bull-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, etc.--so unlike all wild"
1228,Canidae--ever existed freely in a state of nature? It has often been
1228,loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the
1228,crossing of a few aboriginal species; but by crossing we can get only
1228,forms in some degree intermediate between their parents; and if we
1228,"account for our several domestic races by this process, we must"
1228,"admit the former existence of the most extreme forms, as the Italian"
1228,"greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, etc., in the wild state. Moreover,"
1228,the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly
1228,exaggerated. There can be no doubt that a race may be modified
1228,"by occasional crosses, if aided by the careful selection of those"
1228,"individual mongrels, which present any desired character; but that"
1228,a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely
1228,"different races or species, I can hardly believe. Sir J. Sebright"
1228,"expressly experimentised for this object, and failed. The offspring from"
1228,the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I
1228,"have found with pigeons) extremely uniform, and everything seems simple"
1228,enough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several
1228,"generations, hardly two of them will be alike, and then the extreme"
1228,"difficulty, or rather utter hopelessness, of the task becomes apparent."
1228,"Certainly, a breed intermediate between TWO VERY DISTINCT breeds could"
1228,not be got without extreme care and long-continued selection; nor can
1228,I find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus
1228,formed.
1228,
1228,ON THE BREEDS OF THE DOMESTIC PIGEON.
1228,
1228,"Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have,"
1228,"after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons. I have kept every breed"
1228,"which I could purchase or obtain, and have been most kindly favoured"
1228,"with skins from several quarters of the world, more especially by the"
1228,"Honourable W. Elliot from India, and by the Honourable C. Murray from"
1228,Persia. Many treatises in different languages have been published on
1228,"pigeons, and some of them are very important, as being of considerable"
1228,"antiquity. I have associated with several eminent fanciers, and have"
1228,been permitted to join two of the London Pigeon Clubs. The diversity of
1228,the breeds is something astonishing. Compare the English carrier and the
1228,"short-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks,"
1228,"entailing corresponding differences in their skulls. The carrier,"
1228,"more especially the male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful"
1228,"development of the carunculated skin about the head, and this is"
1228,"accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids, very large external orifices"
1228,"to the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth. The short-faced tumbler has a"
1228,beak in outline almost like that of a finch; and the common tumbler has
1228,the singular and strictly inherited habit of flying at a great height in
1228,"a compact flock, and tumbling in the air head over heels. The runt is a"
1228,"bird of great size, with long, massive beak and large feet; some of the"
1228,"sub-breeds of runts have very long necks, others very long wings and"
1228,"tails, others singularly short tails. The barb is allied to the carrier,"
1228,"but, instead of a very long beak, has a very short and very broad"
1228,"one. The pouter has a much elongated body, wings, and legs; and its"
1228,"enormously developed crop, which it glories in inflating, may well"
1228,excite astonishment and even laughter. The turbit has a very short and
1228,"conical beak, with a line of reversed feathers down the breast; and it"
1228,has the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the
1228,oesophagus. The Jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back
1228,"of the neck that they form a hood, and it has, proportionally to its"
1228,"size, much elongated wing and tail feathers. The trumpeter and laugher,"
1228,"as their names express, utter a very different coo from the other"
1228,"breeds. The fantail has thirty or even forty tail-feathers, instead of"
1228,"twelve or fourteen, the normal number in all members of the great pigeon"
1228,"family; and these feathers are kept expanded, and are carried so erect"
1228,that in good birds the head and tail touch; the oil-gland is quite
1228,aborted. Several other less distinct breeds might have been specified.
1228,
1228,"In the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones"
1228,of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously. The
1228,"shape, as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower"
1228,"jaw, varies in a highly remarkable manner. The number of the caudal and"
1228,"sacral vertebrae vary; as does the number of the ribs, together with"
1228,their relative breadth and the presence of processes. The size and shape
1228,of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable; so is the degree
1228,of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula. The
1228,"proportional width of the gape of mouth, the proportional length of the"
1228,"eyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the tongue (not always in"
1228,"strict correlation with the length of beak), the size of the crop and"
1228,of the upper part of the oesophagus; the development and abortion of
1228,the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers; the
1228,relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body; the
1228,relative length of leg and of the feet; the number of scutellae on
1228,"the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of"
1228,structure which are variable. The period at which the perfect plumage is
1228,"acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the nestling"
1228,birds are clothed when hatched. The shape and size of the eggs vary. The
1228,manner of flight differs remarkably; as does in some breeds the voice
1228,"and disposition. Lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females have"
1228,come to differ to a slight degree from each other.
1228,
1228,"Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown"
1228,"to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would"
1228,"certainly, I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover,"
1228,"I do not believe that any ornithologist would place the English carrier,"
1228,"the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in"
1228,the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several
1228,"truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them,"
1228,could be shown him.
1228,
1228,"Great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons, I am fully"
1228,"convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely,"
1228,"that all have descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia), including"
1228,"under this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ"
1228,from each other in the most trifling respects. As several of the reasons
1228,which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other
1228,"cases, I will here briefly give them. If the several breeds are not"
1228,"varieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have"
1228,descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is
1228,impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any
1228,"lesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced by crossing"
1228,two breeds unless one of the parent-stocks possessed the characteristic
1228,enormous crop? The supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been
1228,"rock-pigeons, that is, not breeding or willingly perching on trees. But"
1228,"besides C. livia, with its geographical sub-species, only two or three"
1228,other species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have not any of the
1228,characters of the domestic breeds. Hence the supposed aboriginal stocks
1228,must either still exist in the countries where they were originally
1228,"domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and this,"
1228,"considering their size, habits, and remarkable characters, seems very"
1228,improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. But
1228,"birds breeding on precipices, and good fliers, are unlikely to be"
1228,"exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with"
1228,"the domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of the"
1228,"smaller British islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean. Hence the"
1228,supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the
1228,"rock-pigeon seems to me a very rash assumption. Moreover, the several"
1228,above-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of
1228,"the world, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back"
1228,again into their native country; but not one has ever become wild or
1228,"feral, though the dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very"
1228,"slightly altered state, has become feral in several places. Again, all"
1228,recent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wild
1228,animal to breed freely under domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the
1228,"multiple origin of our pigeons, it must be assumed that at least seven"
1228,or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by
1228,"half-civilized man, as to be quite prolific under confinement."
1228,
1228,"An argument, as it seems to me, of great weight, and applicable in"
1228,"several other cases, is, that the above-specified breeds, though"
1228,"agreeing generally in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and"
1228,"in most parts of their structure, with the wild rock-pigeon, yet are"
1228,certainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure: we may look
1228,in vain throughout the whole great family of Columbidae for a beak like
1228,"that of the English carrier, or that of the short-faced tumbler, or"
1228,barb; for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin; for a crop like
1228,that of the pouter; for tail-feathers like those of the fantail.
1228,Hence it must be assumed not only that half-civilized man succeeded in
1228,"thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or"
1228,"by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that"
1228,these very species have since all become extinct or unknown. So many
1228,strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree.
1228,
1228,Some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve
1228,"consideration. The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, and has a white rump"
1228,"(the Indian sub-species, C. intermedia of Strickland, having it bluish);"
1228,"the tail has a terminal dark bar, with the bases of the outer feathers"
1228,externally edged with white; the wings have two black bars; some
1228,"semi-domestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have, besides"
1228,"the two black bars, the wings chequered with black. These several marks"
1228,"do not occur together in any other species of the whole family. Now, in"
1228,"every one of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all"
1228,"the above marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers,"
1228,"sometimes concur perfectly developed. Moreover, when two birds belonging"
1228,"to two distinct breeds are crossed, neither of which is blue or has"
1228,"any of the above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt"
1228,"suddenly to acquire these characters; for instance, I crossed some"
1228,"uniformly white fantails with some uniformly black barbs, and they"
1228,"produced mottled brown and black birds; these I again crossed together,"
1228,and one grandchild of the pure white fantail and pure black barb was of
1228,"as beautiful a blue colour, with the white rump, double black wing-bar,"
1228,"and barred and white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We"
1228,"can understand these facts, on the well-known principle of reversion to"
1228,"ancestral characters, if all the domestic breeds have descended from the"
1228,"rock-pigeon. But if we deny this, we must make one of the two following"
1228,"highly improbable suppositions. Either, firstly, that all the"
1228,several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the
1228,"rock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus coloured and"
1228,"marked, so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to"
1228,"revert to the very same colours and markings. Or, secondly, that each"
1228,"breed, even the purest, has within a dozen or, at most, within a score"
1228,"of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen or"
1228,"twenty generations, for we know of no fact countenancing the belief that"
1228,"the child ever reverts to some one ancestor, removed by a greater number"
1228,of generations. In a breed which has been crossed only once with some
1228,"distinct breed, the tendency to reversion to any character derived from"
1228,"such cross will naturally become less and less, as in each succeeding"
1228,generation there will be less of the foreign blood; but when there has
1228,"been no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in both"
1228,"parents to revert to a character, which has been lost during some former"
1228,"generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary, may"
1228,be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations.
1228,These two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on
1228,inheritance.
1228,
1228,"Lastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breeds"
1228,of pigeons are perfectly fertile. I can state this from my own
1228,"observations, purposely made on the most distinct breeds. Now, it is"
1228,"difficult, perhaps impossible, to bring forward one case of the hybrid"
1228,offspring of two animals CLEARLY DISTINCT being themselves perfectly
1228,fertile. Some authors believe that long-continued domestication
1228,eliminates this strong tendency to sterility: from the history of the
1228,"dog I think there is some probability in this hypothesis, if applied to"
1228,"species closely related together, though it is unsupported by a single"
1228,experiment. But to extend the hypothesis so far as to suppose that
1228,"species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers, pouters, and"
1228,"fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile, inter se,"
1228,seems to me rash in the extreme.
1228,
1228,"From these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having"
1228,formerly got seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely
1228,under domestication; these supposed species being quite unknown in a
1228,"wild state, and their becoming nowhere feral; these species having very"
1228,"abnormal characters in certain respects, as compared with all other"
1228,"Columbidae, though so like in most other respects to the rock-pigeon;"
1228,the blue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all the
1228,"breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed; the mongrel offspring"
1228,"being perfectly fertile;--from these several reasons, taken together, I"
1228,can feel no doubt that all our domestic breeds have descended from the
1228,Columba livia with its geographical sub-species.
1228,
1228,"In favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that C. livia, or the"
1228,"rock-pigeon, has been found capable of domestication in Europe and in"
1228,India; and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of
1228,"structure with all the domestic breeds. Secondly, although an English"
1228,carrier or short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters
1228,"from the rock-pigeon, yet by comparing the several sub-breeds of these"
1228,"breeds, more especially those brought from distant countries, we"
1228,can make an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure.
1228,"Thirdly, those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed,"
1228,"for instance the wattle and length of beak of the carrier, the shortness"
1228,"of that of the tumbler, and the number of tail-feathers in the fantail,"
1228,are in each breed eminently variable; and the explanation of this fact
1228,"will be obvious when we come to treat of selection. Fourthly, pigeons"
1228,"have been watched, and tended with the utmost care, and loved by many"
1228,people. They have been domesticated for thousands of years in several
1228,quarters of the world; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the
1228,"fifth Aegyptian dynasty, about  B.C., as was pointed out to me by"
1228,Professor Lepsius; but Mr. Birch informs me that pigeons are given in a
1228,"bill of fare in the previous dynasty. In the time of the Romans, as we"
1228,"hear from Pliny, immense prices were given for pigeons; ""nay, they are"
1228,"come to this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree and race."""
1228,"Pigeons were much valued by Akber Khan in India, about the year ;"
1228,"never less than , pigeons were taken with the court. ""The monarchs"
1228,"of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare birds;"" and, continues the"
1228,"courtly historian, ""His Majesty by crossing the breeds, which method"
1228,"was never practised before, has improved them astonishingly."" About"
1228,this same period the Dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old
1228,Romans. The paramount importance of these considerations in explaining
1228,"the immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone, will be"
1228,"obvious when we treat of Selection. We shall then, also, see how it is"
1228,that the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character. It is also
1228,"a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds,"
1228,that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life; and thus
1228,different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary.
1228,
1228,"I have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some,"
1228,"yet quite insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and"
1228,"watched the several kinds, knowing well how true they bred, I felt fully"
1228,as much difficulty in believing that they could ever have descended
1228,"from a common parent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar"
1228,"conclusion in regard to the many species of finches, or other large"
1228,"groups of birds, in nature. One circumstance has struck me much;"
1228,"namely, that all the breeders of the various domestic animals and"
1228,"the cultivators of plants, with whom I have ever conversed, or whose"
1228,"treatises I have read, are firmly convinced that the several breeds"
1228,"to which each has attended, are descended from so many aboriginally"
1228,"distinct species. Ask, as I have asked, a celebrated raiser of Hereford"
1228,"cattle, whether his cattle might not have descended from long horns, and"
1228,"he will laugh you to scorn. I have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or"
1228,"duck, or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main"
1228,"breed was descended from a distinct species. Van Mons, in his treatise"
1228,"on pears and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several"
1228,"sorts, for instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have"
1228,proceeded from the seeds of the same tree. Innumerable other examples
1228,"could be given. The explanation, I think, is simple: from long-continued"
1228,study they are strongly impressed with the differences between the
1228,"several races; and though they well know that each race varies slightly,"
1228,"for they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they"
1228,"ignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight"
1228,differences accumulated during many successive generations. May not
1228,"those naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than"
1228,"does the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate"
1228,"links in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our domestic"
1228,races have descended from the same parents--may they not learn a lesson
1228,"of caution, when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature"
1228,being lineal descendants of other species?
1228,
1228,SELECTION.
1228,
1228,Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been
1228,"produced, either from one or from several allied species. Some little"
1228,"effect may, perhaps, be attributed to the direct action of the external"
1228,"conditions of life, and some little to habit; but he would be a bold"
1228,man who would account by such agencies for the differences of a dray and
1228,"race horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon."
1228,One of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we
1228,"see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good,"
1228,but to man's use or fancy. Some variations useful to him have probably
1228,"arisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe"
1228,"that the fuller's teazle, with its hooks, which cannot be rivalled by"
1228,"any mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and"
1228,this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. So it has
1228,probably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been
1228,the case with the ancon sheep. But when we compare the dray-horse and
1228,"race-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted"
1228,"either for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one"
1228,"breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for another"
1228,"purpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each good for man in"
1228,"very different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so pertinacious"
1228,"in battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with ""everlasting"
1228,"layers"" which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and"
1228,"elegant; when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard,"
1228,"and flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different"
1228,"seasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we"
1228,"must, I think, look further than to mere variability. We cannot suppose"
1228,that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as
1228,"we now see them; indeed, in several cases, we know that this has not"
1228,been their history. The key is man's power of accumulative selection:
1228,nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain
1228,directions useful to him. In this sense he may be said to make for
1228,himself useful breeds.
1228,
1228,The great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical.
1228,"It is certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a"
1228,"single lifetime, modified to a large extent some breeds of cattle and"
1228,"sheep. In order fully to realise what they have done, it is almost"
1228,"necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject,"
1228,and to inspect the animals. Breeders habitually speak of an animal's
1228,"organisation as something quite plastic, which they can model almost"
1228,as they please. If I had space I could quote numerous passages to this
1228,"effect from highly competent authorities. Youatt, who was probably"
1228,better acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any
1228,"other individual, and who was himself a very good judge of an animal,"
1228,"speaks of the principle of selection as ""that which enables the"
1228,"agriculturist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but to"
1228,"change it altogether. It is the magician's wand, by means of which"
1228,"he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases."" Lord"
1228,"Somerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep, says:--""It"
1228,would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in
1228,"itself, and then had given it existence."" That most skilful breeder,"
1228,"Sir John Sebright, used to say, with respect to pigeons, that ""he would"
1228,"produce any given feather in three years, but it would take him"
1228,"six years to obtain head and beak."" In Saxony the importance of the"
1228,"principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised,"
1228,that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are
1228,"studied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done three times at"
1228,"intervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked and classed, so"
1228,that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding.
1228,
1228,What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous
1228,prices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have now been
1228,exported to almost every quarter of the world. The improvement is by no
1228,means generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders
1228,"are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes amongst closely"
1228,"allied sub-breeds. And when a cross has been made, the closest selection"
1228,is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If selection
1228,"consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety, and breeding"
1228,"from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth"
1228,notice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by
1228,"the accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of"
1228,differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye--differences
1228,which I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. Not one man in
1228,a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an
1228,"eminent breeder. If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his"
1228,"subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable"
1228,"perseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements; if he"
1228,"wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail. Few would readily"
1228,believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to
1228,become even a skilful pigeon-fancier.
1228,
1228,The same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations
1228,are here often more abrupt. No one supposes that our choicest
1228,productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal
1228,"stock. We have proofs that this is not so in some cases, in which exact"
1228,"records have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the"
1228,steadily-increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted. We see
1228,"an astonishing improvement in many florists' flowers, when the flowers"
1228,of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty
1228,"years ago. When a race of plants is once pretty well established, the"
1228,"seed-raisers do not pick out the best plants, but merely go over their"
1228,"seed-beds, and pull up the ""rogues,"" as they call the plants that"
1228,deviate from the proper standard. With animals this kind of selection
1228,"is, in fact, also followed; for hardly any one is so careless as to"
1228,allow his worst animals to breed.
1228,
1228,"In regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated"
1228,"effects of selection--namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in"
1228,the different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the
1228,"diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the"
1228,"kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties;"
1228,"and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in"
1228,comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. See
1228,"how different the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the"
1228,"flowers; how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the"
1228,leaves; how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ
1228,"in size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very"
1228,slight differences. It is not that the varieties which differ largely
1228,in some one point do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly
1228,"ever, perhaps never, the case. The laws of correlation of growth,"
1228,"the importance of which should never be overlooked, will ensure some"
1228,"differences; but, as a general rule, I cannot doubt that the continued"
1228,"selection of slight variations, either in the leaves, the flowers, or"
1228,"the fruit, will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these"
1228,characters.
1228,
1228,It may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to
1228,methodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century;
1228,"it has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises"
1228,"have been published on the subject; and the result, I may add, has been,"
1228,"in a corresponding degree, rapid and important. But it is very far from"
1228,true that the principle is a modern discovery. I could give several
1228,references to the full acknowledgment of the importance of the principle
1228,in works of high antiquity. In rude and barbarous periods of English
1228,"history choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to"
1228,prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain
1228,"size was ordered, and this may be compared to the ""roguing"" of plants"
1228,by nurserymen. The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an
1228,ancient Chinese encyclopaedia. Explicit rules are laid down by some of
1228,"the Roman classical writers. From passages in Genesis, it is clear that"
1228,the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to.
1228,"Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to"
1228,"improve the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages"
1228,in Pliny. The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by
1228,"colour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs. Livingstone"
1228,shows how much good domestic breeds are valued by the negroes of the
1228,interior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans. Some of these
1228,"facts do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of"
1228,"domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now"
1228,"attended to by the lowest savages. It would, indeed, have been a strange"
1228,"fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of"
1228,good and bad qualities is so obvious.
1228,
1228,"At the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with"
1228,"a distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior"
1228,"to anything existing in the country. But, for our purpose, a kind of"
1228,"Selection, which may be called Unconscious, and which results from every"
1228,"one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is"
1228,"more important. Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries"
1228,"to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best"
1228,"dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the"
1228,"breed. Nevertheless I cannot doubt that this process, continued during"
1228,"centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as"
1228,"Bakewell, Collins, etc., by this very same process, only carried on more"
1228,"methodically, did greatly modify, even during their own lifetimes, the"
1228,forms and qualities of their cattle. Slow and insensible changes of this
1228,kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful
1228,"drawings of the breeds in question had been made long ago, which might"
1228,"serve for comparison. In some cases, however, unchanged or but little"
1228,changed individuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised
1228,"districts, where the breed has been less improved. There is reason to"
1228,believe that King Charles's spaniel has been unconsciously modified to
1228,a large extent since the time of that monarch. Some highly competent
1228,authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from the
1228,"spaniel, and has probably been slowly altered from it. It is known that"
1228,"the English pointer has been greatly changed within the last century,"
1228,"and in this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected"
1228,"by crosses with the fox-hound; but what concerns us is, that the change"
1228,"has been effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually,"
1228,"that, though the old Spanish pointer certainly came from Spain, Mr."
1228,"Borrow has not seen, as I am informed by him, any native dog in Spain"
1228,like our pointer.
1228,
1228,"By a similar process of selection, and by careful training, the whole"
1228,body of English racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size
1228,"the parent Arab stock, so that the latter, by the regulations for the"
1228,"Goodwood Races, are favoured in the weights they carry. Lord Spencer and"
1228,others have shown how the cattle of England have increased in weight
1228,"and in early maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this"
1228,country. By comparing the accounts given in old pigeon treatises of
1228,"carriers and tumblers with these breeds as now existing in Britain,"
1228,"India, and Persia, we can, I think, clearly trace the stages through"
1228,"which they have insensibly passed, and come to differ so greatly from"
1228,the rock-pigeon.
1228,
1228,Youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of
1228,"selection, which may be considered as unconsciously followed, in so far"
1228,that the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have
1228,"produced the result which ensued--namely, the production of two distinct"
1228,strains. The two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr.
1228,"Burgess, as Mr. Youatt remarks, ""have been purely bred from the original"
1228,stock of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a
1228,suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with
1228,the subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one
1228,"instance from the pure blood of Mr. Bakewell's flock, and yet the"
1228,difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so
1228,"great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties."""
1228,
1228,If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited
1228,"character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal"
1228,"particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully"
1228,"preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are"
1228,"so liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more"
1228,offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a
1228,kind of unconscious selection going on. We see the value set on animals
1228,"even by the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and"
1228,"devouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value than"
1228,their dogs.
1228,
1228,"In plants the same gradual process of improvement, through the"
1228,"occasional preservation of the best individuals, whether or not"
1228,sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct
1228,"varieties, and whether or not two or more species or races have become"
1228,"blended together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased"
1228,"size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease,"
1228,"rose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the"
1228,older varieties or with their parent-stocks. No one would ever expect to
1228,get a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant. No
1228,one would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the seed of a
1228,"wild pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild,"
1228,"if it had come from a garden-stock. The pear, though cultivated in"
1228,"classical times, appears, from Pliny's description, to have been a"
1228,fruit of very inferior quality. I have seen great surprise expressed
1228,"in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners, in having"
1228,"produced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the art,"
1228,"I cannot doubt, has been simple, and, as far as the final result is"
1228,"concerned, has been followed almost unconsciously. It has consisted in"
1228,"always cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and, when"
1228,"a slightly better variety has chanced to appear, selecting it, and so"
1228,"onwards. But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated"
1228,"the best pear they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we"
1228,"should eat; though we owe our excellent fruit, in some small degree,"
1228,to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they
1228,could anywhere find.
1228,
1228,"A large amount of change in our cultivated plants, thus slowly and"
1228,"unconsciously accumulated, explains, as I believe, the well-known fact,"
1228,"that in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise, and therefore do"
1228,"not know, the wild parent-stocks of the plants which have been longest"
1228,cultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens. If it has taken centuries
1228,or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to
1228,"their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it"
1228,"is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region"
1228,"inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth"
1228,"culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by"
1228,"a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but"
1228,that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up
1228,to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in
1228,countries anciently civilised.
1228,
1228,"In regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should"
1228,not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their
1228,"own food, at least during certain seasons. And in two countries very"
1228,"differently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having"
1228,"slightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed"
1228,"better in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of"
1228,"""natural selection,"" as will hereafter be more fully explained, two"
1228,"sub-breeds might be formed. This, perhaps, partly explains what has been"
1228,"remarked by some authors, namely, that the varieties kept by savages"
1228,have more of the character of species than the varieties kept in
1228,civilised countries.
1228,
1228,On the view here given of the all-important part which selection by
1228,"man has played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic"
1228,races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's
1228,"wants or fancies. We can, I think, further understand the frequently"
1228,"abnormal character of our domestic races, and likewise their differences"
1228,being so great in external characters and relatively so slight in
1228,"internal parts or organs. Man can hardly select, or only with much"
1228,"difficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally"
1228,visible; and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal. He can never
1228,"act by selection, excepting on variations which are first given to"
1228,him in some slight degree by nature. No man would ever try to make
1228,"a fantail, till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight"
1228,"degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a"
1228,crop of somewhat unusual size; and the more abnormal or unusual any
1228,"character was when it first appeared, the more likely it would be to"
1228,catch his attention. But to use such an expression as trying to make a
1228,"fantail, is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect. The man"
1228,"who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail, never dreamed"
1228,"what the descendants of that pigeon would become through long-continued,"
1228,partly unconscious and partly methodical selection. Perhaps the parent
1228,"bird of all fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded,"
1228,"like the present Java fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct"
1228,"breeds, in which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted."
1228,Perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than
1228,"the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus,--a habit which"
1228,"is disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the"
1228,breed.
1228,
1228,Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would
1228,be necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small
1228,"differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however"
1228,"slight, in one's own possession. Nor must the value which would formerly"
1228,"be set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species,"
1228,"be judged of by the value which would now be set on them, after several"
1228,"breeds have once fairly been established. Many slight differences might,"
1228,"and indeed do now, arise amongst pigeons, which are rejected as faults"
1228,or deviations from the standard of perfection of each breed. The common
1228,goose has not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the Thoulouse
1228,"and the common breed, which differ only in colour, that most fleeting of"
1228,"characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows."
1228,
1228,I think these views further explain what has sometimes been
1228,noticed--namely that we know nothing about the origin or history of
1228,"any of our domestic breeds. But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of"
1228,"a language, can hardly be said to have had a definite origin. A man"
1228,preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of
1228,"structure, or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals"
1228,"and thus improves them, and the improved individuals slowly spread in"
1228,the immediate neighbourhood. But as yet they will hardly have a distinct
1228,"name, and from being only slightly valued, their history will be"
1228,"disregarded. When further improved by the same slow and gradual process,"
1228,"they will spread more widely, and will get recognised as something"
1228,"distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial"
1228,"name. In semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the"
1228,spreading and knowledge of any new sub-breed will be a slow process.
1228,As soon as the points of value of the new sub-breed are once fully
1228,"acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of unconscious"
1228,"selection will always tend,--perhaps more at one period than at another,"
1228,"as the breed rises or falls in fashion,--perhaps more in one district"
1228,"than in another, according to the state of civilisation of the"
1228,"inhabitants--slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed,"
1228,whatever they may be. But the chance will be infinitely small of any
1228,"record having been preserved of such slow, varying, and insensible"
1228,changes.
1228,
1228,"I must now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable, or the"
1228,"reverse, to man's power of selection. A high degree of variability is"
1228,"obviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to"
1228,"work on; not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient,"
1228,"with extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount"
1228,of modification in almost any desired direction. But as variations
1228,"manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the"
1228,chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number
1228,of individuals being kept; and hence this comes to be of the highest
1228,"importance to success. On this principle Marshall has remarked, with"
1228,"respect to the sheep of parts of Yorkshire, that ""as they generally"
1228,"belong to poor people, and are mostly IN SMALL LOTS, they never can be"
1228,"improved."" On the other hand, nurserymen, from raising large stocks"
1228,"of the same plants, are generally far more successful than amateurs in"
1228,getting new and valuable varieties. The keeping of a large number of
1228,individuals of a species in any country requires that the species should
1228,"be placed under favourable conditions of life, so as to breed freely in"
1228,"that country. When the individuals of any species are scanty, all the"
1228,"individuals, whatever their quality may be, will generally be allowed"
1228,"to breed, and this will effectually prevent selection. But probably the"
1228,"most important point of all, is, that the animal or plant should be"
1228,"so highly useful to man, or so much valued by him, that the closest"
1228,attention should be paid to even the slightest deviation in the
1228,qualities or structure of each individual. Unless such attention be paid
1228,"nothing can be effected. I have seen it gravely remarked, that it was"
1228,most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners
1228,began to attend closely to this plant. No doubt the strawberry had
1228,"always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight varieties had been"
1228,"neglected. As soon, however, as gardeners picked out individual plants"
1228,"with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and raised seedlings"
1228,"from them, and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them,"
1228,"then, there appeared (aided by some crossing with distinct species)"
1228,those many admirable varieties of the strawberry which have been raised
1228,during the last thirty or forty years.
1228,
1228,"In the case of animals with separate sexes, facility in preventing"
1228,crosses is an important element of success in the formation of new
1228,"races,--at least, in a country which is already stocked with other"
1228,races. In this respect enclosure of the land plays a part. Wandering
1228,savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one
1228,"breed of the same species. Pigeons can be mated for life, and this is a"
1228,"great convenience to the fancier, for thus many races may be kept true,"
1228,though mingled in the same aviary; and this circumstance must have
1228,"largely favoured the improvement and formation of new breeds. Pigeons,"
1228,"I may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate,"
1228,"and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed they serve"
1228,"for food. On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling habits,"
1228,"cannot be matched, and, although so much valued by women and children,"
1228,we hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up; such breeds as we do
1228,"sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country, often"
1228,from islands. Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary
1228,"less than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the"
1228,"cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may be attributed in main part"
1228,"to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the"
1228,"difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by"
1228,"poor people, and little attention paid to their breeding; in peacocks,"
1228,"from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese,"
1228,"from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more"
1228,especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct
1228,breeds.
1228,
1228,To sum up on the origin of our Domestic Races of animals and plants.
1228,"I believe that the conditions of life, from their action on the"
1228,"reproductive system, are so far of the highest importance as causing"
1228,variability. I do not believe that variability is an inherent and
1228,"necessary contingency, under all circumstances, with all organic beings,"
1228,as some authors have thought. The effects of variability are modified by
1228,various degrees of inheritance and of reversion. Variability is governed
1228,"by many unknown laws, more especially by that of correlation of growth."
1228,Something may be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of
1228,life. Something must be attributed to use and disuse. The final result
1228,"is thus rendered infinitely complex. In some cases, I do not doubt"
1228,"that the intercrossing of species, aboriginally distinct, has played an"
1228,important part in the origin of our domestic productions. When in
1228,"any country several domestic breeds have once been established, their"
1228,"occasional intercrossing, with the aid of selection, has, no doubt,"
1228,largely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds; but the importance of
1228,"the crossing of varieties has, I believe, been greatly exaggerated, both"
1228,in regard to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed.
1228,"In plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings, buds, etc., the"
1228,importance of the crossing both of distinct species and of varieties
1228,is immense; for the cultivator here quite disregards the extreme
1228,"variability both of hybrids and mongrels, and the frequent sterility of"
1228,hybrids; but the cases of plants not propagated by seed are of little
1228,"importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary. Over all"
1228,these causes of Change I am convinced that the accumulative action
1228,"of Selection, whether applied methodically and more quickly, or"
1228,"unconsciously and more slowly, but more efficiently, is by far the"
1228,predominant Power.
1228,
1228,
1228,
1228,
1228,. VARIATION UNDER NATURE.
1228,
1228,"Variability. Individual differences. Doubtful species. Wide ranging,"
1228,"much diffused, and common species vary most. Species of the larger"
1228,genera in any country vary more than the species of the smaller genera.
1228,Many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in being
1228,"very closely, but unequally, related to each other, and in having"
1228,restricted ranges.
1228,
1228,Before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic
1228,"beings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether these"
1228,latter are subject to any variation. To treat this subject at all
1228,"properly, a long catalogue of dry facts should be given; but these I"
1228,shall reserve for my future work. Nor shall I here discuss the various
1228,definitions which have been given of the term species. No one definition
1228,has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely
1228,what he means when he speaks of a species. Generally the term includes
1228,"the unknown element of a distinct act of creation. The term ""variety"""
1228,is almost equally difficult to define; but here community of descent is
1228,"almost universally implied, though it can rarely be proved. We have also"
1228,what are called monstrosities; but they graduate into varieties. By a
1228,monstrosity I presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure
1228,"in one part, either injurious to or not useful to the species, and"
1228,"not generally propagated. Some authors use the term ""variation"" in a"
1228,"technical sense, as implying a modification directly due to the physical"
1228,"conditions of life; and ""variations"" in this sense are supposed not to"
1228,be inherited: but who can say that the dwarfed condition of shells in
1228,"the brackish waters of the Baltic, or dwarfed plants on Alpine summits,"
1228,"or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards, would not in some"
1228,cases be inherited for at least some few generations? and in this case I
1228,presume that the form would be called a variety.
1228,
1228,"Again, we have many slight differences which may be called individual"
1228,"differences, such as are known frequently to appear in the offspring"
1228,"from the same parents, or which may be presumed to have thus arisen,"
1228,from being frequently observed in the individuals of the same species
1228,inhabiting the same confined locality. No one supposes that all the
1228,individuals of the same species are cast in the very same mould. These
1228,"individual differences are highly important for us, as they afford"
1228,"materials for natural selection to accumulate, in the same manner as"
1228,man can accumulate in any given direction individual differences in his
1228,domesticated productions. These individual differences generally affect
1228,what naturalists consider unimportant parts; but I could show by a long
1228,"catalogue of facts, that parts which must be called important, whether"
1228,"viewed under a physiological or classificatory point of view, sometimes"
1228,vary in the individuals of the same species. I am convinced that the
1228,most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the
1228,"cases of variability, even in important parts of structure, which he"
1228,"could collect on good authority, as I have collected, during a course of"
1228,years. It should be remembered that systematists are far from pleased at
1228,"finding variability in important characters, and that there are not"
1228,"many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs, and"
1228,compare them in many specimens of the same species. I should never
1228,have expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the great
1228,central ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same
1228,species; I should have expected that changes of this nature could have
1228,been effected only by slow degrees: yet quite recently Mr. Lubbock has
1228,"shown a degree of variability in these main nerves in Coccus, which may"
1228,almost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree.
1228,"This philosophical naturalist, I may add, has also quite recently shown"
1228,that the muscles in the larvae of certain insects are very far from
1228,uniform. Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that
1228,important organs never vary; for these same authors practically rank
1228,that character as important (as some few naturalists have honestly
1228,"confessed) which does not vary; and, under this point of view, no"
1228,instance of an important part varying will ever be found: but under any
1228,other point of view many instances assuredly can be given.
1228,
1228,"There is one point connected with individual differences, which seems"
1228,to me extremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have sometimes
1228,"been called ""protean"" or ""polymorphic,"" in which the species present"
1228,an inordinate amount of variation; and hardly two naturalists can agree
1228,which forms to rank as species and which as varieties. We may instance
1228,"Rubus, Rosa, and Hieracium amongst plants, several genera of insects,"
1228,and several genera of Brachiopod shells. In most polymorphic genera
1228,some of the species have fixed and definite characters. Genera which
1228,"are polymorphic in one country seem to be, with some few exceptions,"
1228,"polymorphic in other countries, and likewise, judging from Brachiopod"
1228,"shells, at former periods of time. These facts seem to be very"
1228,"perplexing, for they seem to show that this kind of variability is"
1228,independent of the conditions of life. I am inclined to suspect that we
1228,see in these polymorphic genera variations in points of structure which
1228,"are of no service or disservice to the species, and which consequently"
1228,"have not been seized on and rendered definite by natural selection, as"
1228,hereafter will be explained.
1228,
1228,Those forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of
1228,"species, but which are so closely similar to some other forms, or are so"
1228,"closely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do"
1228,"not like to rank them as distinct species, are in several respects the"
1228,most important for us. We have every reason to believe that many of
1228,these doubtful and closely-allied forms have permanently retained their
1228,"characters in their own country for a long time; for as long, as far as"
1228,"we know, as have good and true species. Practically, when a naturalist"
1228,"can unite two forms together by others having intermediate characters,"
1228,"he treats the one as a variety of the other, ranking the most common,"
1228,"but sometimes the one first described, as the species, and the other"
1228,"as the variety. But cases of great difficulty, which I will not here"
1228,"enumerate, sometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank one"
1228,"form as a variety of another, even when they are closely connected by"
1228,intermediate links; nor will the commonly-assumed hybrid nature of the
1228,"intermediate links always remove the difficulty. In very many cases,"
1228,"however, one form is ranked as a variety of another, not because the"
1228,"intermediate links have actually been found, but because analogy leads"
1228,"the observer to suppose either that they do now somewhere exist, or may"
1228,formerly have existed; and here a wide door for the entry of doubt and
1228,conjecture is opened.
1228,
1228,"Hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or"
1228,"a variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide"
1228,"experience seems the only guide to follow. We must, however, in many"
1228,"cases, decide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked and"
1228,well-known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species
1228,by at least some competent judges.
1228,
1228,That varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be
1228,"disputed. Compare the several floras of Great Britain, of France or"
1228,"of the United States, drawn up by different botanists, and see what"
1228,a surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good
1228,"species, and by another as mere varieties. Mr. H. C. Watson, to whom I"
1228,"lie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds, has marked for"
1228,"me  British plants, which are generally considered as varieties, but"
1228,which have all been ranked by botanists as species; and in making this
1228,"list he has omitted many trifling varieties, but which nevertheless have"
1228,"been ranked by some botanists as species, and he has entirely omitted"
1228,"several highly polymorphic genera. Under genera, including the most"
1228,"polymorphic forms, Mr. Babington gives  species, whereas Mr. Bentham"
1228,"gives only ,--a difference of  doubtful forms! Amongst animals"
1228,"which unite for each birth, and which are highly locomotive, doubtful"
1228,"forms, ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety,"
1228,"can rarely be found within the same country, but are common in separated"
1228,"areas. How many of those birds and insects in North America and Europe,"
1228,"which differ very slightly from each other, have been ranked by one"
1228,"eminent naturalist as undoubted species, and by another as varieties,"
1228,"or, as they are often called, as geographical races! Many years ago,"
1228,"when comparing, and seeing others compare, the birds from the separate"
1228,"islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, both one with another, and with"
1228,"those from the American mainland, I was much struck how entirely vague"
1228,and arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties. On the
1228,islets of the little Madeira group there are many insects which are
1228,"characterized as varieties in Mr. Wollaston's admirable work, but"
1228,which it cannot be doubted would be ranked as distinct species by many
1228,"entomologists. Even Ireland has a few animals, now generally regarded"
1228,"as varieties, but which have been ranked as species by some zoologists."
1228,Several most experienced ornithologists consider our British red grouse
1228,"as only a strongly-marked race of a Norwegian species, whereas the"
1228,greater number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to Great
1228,Britain. A wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads
1228,"many naturalists to rank both as distinct species; but what distance, it"
1228,"has been well asked, will suffice? if that between America and Europe"
1228,"is ample, will that between the Continent and the Azores, or Madeira, or"
1228,"the Canaries, or Ireland, be sufficient? It must be admitted that many"
1228,"forms, considered by highly-competent judges as varieties, have so"
1228,perfectly the character of species that they are ranked by other
1228,highly-competent judges as good and true species. But to discuss whether
1228,"they are rightly called species or varieties, before any definition of"
1228,"these terms has been generally accepted, is vainly to beat the air."
1228,
1228,Many of the cases of strongly-marked varieties or doubtful species well
1228,"deserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument, from"
1228,"geographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, etc., have"
1228,been brought to bear on the attempt to determine their rank. I will here
1228,"give only a single instance,--the well-known one of the primrose and"
1228,"cowslip, or Primula veris and elatior. These plants differ considerably"
1228,in appearance; they have a different flavour and emit a different
1228,odour; they flower at slightly different periods; they grow in somewhat
1228,different stations; they ascend mountains to different heights; they
1228,"have different geographical ranges; and lastly, according to very"
1228,numerous experiments made during several years by that most careful
1228,"observer Gartner, they can be crossed only with much difficulty."
1228,We could hardly wish for better evidence of the two forms being
1228,"specifically distinct. On the other hand, they are united by many"
1228,"intermediate links, and it is very doubtful whether these links are"
1228,"hybrids; and there is, as it seems to me, an overwhelming amount of"
1228,"experimental evidence, showing that they descend from common parents,"
1228,and consequently must be ranked as varieties.
1228,
1228,"Close investigation, in most cases, will bring naturalists to an"
1228,"agreement how to rank doubtful forms. Yet it must be confessed, that it"
1228,is in the best-known countries that we find the greatest number of forms
1228,"of doubtful value. I have been struck with the fact, that if any animal"
1228,"or plant in a state of nature be highly useful to man, or from any cause"
1228,"closely attract his attention, varieties of it will almost universally"
1228,"be found recorded. These varieties, moreover, will be often ranked by"
1228,"some authors as species. Look at the common oak, how closely it has"
1228,been studied; yet a German author makes more than a dozen species out
1228,"of forms, which are very generally considered as varieties; and in"
1228,this country the highest botanical authorities and practical men can be
1228,quoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated oaks are either good
1228,and distinct species or mere varieties.
1228,
1228,When a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms
1228,"quite unknown to him, he is at first much perplexed to determine what"
1228,"differences to consider as specific, and what as varieties; for he"
1228,knows nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group
1228,"is subject; and this shows, at least, how very generally there is some"
1228,variation. But if he confine his attention to one class within one
1228,"country, he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful"
1228,"forms. His general tendency will be to make many species, for he will"
1228,"become impressed, just like the pigeon or poultry-fancier before alluded"
1228,"to, with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually"
1228,studying; and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation
1228,"in other groups and in other countries, by which to correct his first"
1228,"impressions. As he extends the range of his observations, he will meet"
1228,with more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a greater number
1228,"of closely-allied forms. But if his observations be widely extended, he"
1228,will in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to
1228,call varieties and which species; but he will succeed in this at the
1228,"expense of admitting much variation,--and the truth of this admission"
1228,"will often be disputed by other naturalists. When, moreover, he comes to"
1228,"study allied forms brought from countries not now continuous, in which"
1228,case he can hardly hope to find the intermediate links between his
1228,"doubtful forms, he will have to trust almost entirely to analogy, and"
1228,his difficulties will rise to a climax.
1228,
1228,Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between
1228,"species and sub-species--that is, the forms which in the opinion of some"
1228,"naturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at the rank of"
1228,"species; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or"
1228,between lesser varieties and individual differences. These differences
1228,blend into each other in an insensible series; and a series impresses
1228,the mind with the idea of an actual passage.
1228,
1228,"Hence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to"
1228,"the systematist, as of high importance for us, as being the first step"
1228,towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording
1228,in works on natural history. And I look at varieties which are in any
1228,"degree more distinct and permanent, as steps leading to more strongly"
1228,"marked and more permanent varieties; and at these latter, as leading to"
1228,"sub-species, and to species. The passage from one stage of difference"
1228,"to another and higher stage may be, in some cases, due merely to the"
1228,long-continued action of different physical conditions in two different
1228,regions; but I have not much faith in this view; and I attribute the
1228,"passage of a variety, from a state in which it differs very slightly"
1228,"from its parent to one in which it differs more, to the action of"
1228,natural selection in accumulating (as will hereafter be more fully
1228,explained) differences of structure in certain definite directions.
1228,Hence I believe a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient
1228,species; but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of by
1228,the general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this
1228,work.
1228,
1228,It need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species
1228,necessarily attain the rank of species. They may whilst in this
1228,"incipient state become extinct, or they may endure as varieties for very"
1228,"long periods, as has been shown to be the case by Mr. Wollaston with the"
1228,varieties of certain fossil land-shells in Madeira. If a variety were
1228,"to flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent species, it would then"
1228,"rank as the species, and the species as the variety; or it might come to"
1228,"supplant and exterminate the parent species; or both might co-exist, and"
1228,both rank as independent species. But we shall hereafter have to return
1228,to this subject.
1228,
1228,"From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species,"
1228,as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of
1228,"individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not"
1228,"essentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less"
1228,"distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again,"
1228,"in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied"
1228,"arbitrarily, and for mere convenience sake."
1228,
1228,"Guided by theoretical considerations, I thought that some interesting"
1228,results might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the
1228,"species which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several"
1228,well-worked floras. At first this seemed a simple task; but Mr. H. C.
1228,"Watson, to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance"
1228,"on this subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties, as"
1228,"did subsequently Dr. Hooker, even in stronger terms. I shall reserve"
1228,"for my future work the discussion of these difficulties, and the tables"
1228,themselves of the proportional numbers of the varying species.
1228,"Dr. Hooker permits me to add, that after having carefully read my"
1228,"manuscript, and examined the tables, he thinks that the following"
1228,"statements are fairly well established. The whole subject, however,"
1228,"treated as it necessarily here is with much brevity, is rather"
1228,"perplexing, and allusions cannot be avoided to the ""struggle for"
1228,"existence,"" ""divergence of character,"" and other questions, hereafter to"
1228,be discussed.
1228,
1228,Alph. De Candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide
1228,"ranges generally present varieties; and this might have been expected,"
1228,"as they become exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as they"
1228,"come into competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far more"
1228,important circumstance) with different sets of organic beings. But my
1228,"tables further show that, in any limited country, the species which are"
1228,"most common, that is abound most in individuals, and the species"
1228,which are most widely diffused within their own country (and this is a
1228,"different consideration from wide range, and to a certain extent from"
1228,"commonness), often give rise to varieties sufficiently well-marked to"
1228,"have been recorded in botanical works. Hence it is the most flourishing,"
1228,"or, as they may be called, the dominant species,--those which range"
1228,"widely over the world, are the most diffused in their own country,"
1228,"and are the most numerous in individuals,--which oftenest produce"
1228,"well-marked varieties, or, as I consider them, incipient species. And"
1228,"this, perhaps, might have been anticipated; for, as varieties, in order"
1228,"to become in any degree permanent, necessarily have to struggle with the"
1228,"other inhabitants of the country, the species which are already dominant"
1228,"will be the most likely to yield offspring which, though in some slight"
1228,"degree modified, will still inherit those advantages that enabled their"
1228,parents to become dominant over their compatriots.
1228,
1228,If the plants inhabiting a country and described in any Flora be divided
1228,"into two equal masses, all those in the larger genera being placed"
1228,"on one side, and all those in the smaller genera on the other side, a"
1228,somewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant
1228,"species will be found on the side of the larger genera. This, again,"
1228,might have been anticipated; for the mere fact of many species of the
1228,"same genus inhabiting any country, shows that there is something in the"
1228,organic or inorganic conditions of that country favourable to the genus;
1228,"and, consequently, we might have expected to have found in the larger"
1228,"genera, or those including many species, a large proportional number of"
1228,"dominant species. But so many causes tend to obscure this result, that"
1228,I am surprised that my tables show even a small majority on the side of
1228,the larger genera. I will here allude to only two causes of obscurity.
1228,Fresh-water and salt-loving plants have generally very wide ranges and
1228,"are much diffused, but this seems to be connected with the nature of the"
1228,"stations inhabited by them, and has little or no relation to the size of"
1228,"the genera to which the species belong. Again, plants low in the scale"
1228,of organisation are generally much more widely diffused than plants
1228,higher in the scale; and here again there is no close relation to the
1228,size of the genera. The cause of lowly-organised plants ranging widely
1228,will be discussed in our chapter on geographical distribution.
1228,
1228,From looking at species as only strongly-marked and well-defined
1228,"varieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera"
1228,"in each country would oftener present varieties, than the species of the"
1228,smaller genera; for wherever many closely related species (i.e. species
1228,"of the same genus) have been formed, many varieties or incipient species"
1228,"ought, as a general rule, to be now forming. Where many large trees"
1228,"grow, we expect to find saplings. Where many species of a genus have"
1228,"been formed through variation, circumstances have been favourable"
1228,for variation; and hence we might expect that the circumstances would
1228,"generally be still favourable to variation. On the other hand, if we"
1228,"look at each species as a special act of creation, there is no apparent"
1228,"reason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species,"
1228,than in one having few.
1228,
1228,To test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of
1228,"twelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into"
1228,"two nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side,"
1228,"and those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably"
1228,proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the
1228,"side of the larger genera present varieties, than on the side of the"
1228,"smaller genera. Moreover, the species of the large genera which present"
1228,"any varieties, invariably present a larger average number of varieties"
1228,than do the species of the small genera. Both these results follow when
1228,"another division is made, and when all the smallest genera, with from"
1228,"only one to four species, are absolutely excluded from the tables."
1228,These facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only
1228,strongly marked and permanent varieties; for wherever many species of
1228,"the same genus have been formed, or where, if we may use the expression,"
1228,"the manufactory of species has been active, we ought generally to find"
1228,"the manufactory still in action, more especially as we have every reason"
1228,to believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one.
1228,"And this certainly is the case, if varieties be looked at as incipient"
1228,"species; for my tables clearly show as a general rule that, wherever"
1228,"many species of a genus have been formed, the species of that genus"
1228,"present a number of varieties, that is of incipient species, beyond the"
1228,"average. It is not that all large genera are now varying much, and are"
1228,"thus increasing in the number of their species, or that no small genera"
1228,"are now varying and increasing; for if this had been so, it would have"
1228,been fatal to my theory; inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small
1228,genera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size;
1228,"and that large genera have often come to their maxima, declined, and"
1228,"disappeared. All that we want to show is, that where many species of a"
1228,"genus have been formed, on an average many are still forming; and this"
1228,holds good.
1228,
1228,There are other relations between the species of large genera and their
1228,recorded varieties which deserve notice. We have seen that there is no
1228,infallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well-marked
1228,varieties; and in those cases in which intermediate links have not been
1228,"found between doubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to"
1228,"a determination by the amount of difference between them, judging by"
1228,analogy whether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the
1228,rank of species. Hence the amount of difference is one very important
1228,criterion in settling whether two forms should be ranked as species or
1228,"varieties. Now Fries has remarked in regard to plants, and Westwood in"
1228,"regard to insects, that in large genera the amount of difference between"
1228,the species is often exceedingly small. I have endeavoured to test this
1228,"numerically by averages, and, as far as my imperfect results go, they"
1228,always confirm the view. I have also consulted some sagacious and most
1228,"experienced observers, and, after deliberation, they concur in this"
1228,"view. In this respect, therefore, the species of the larger genera"
1228,"resemble varieties, more than do the species of the smaller genera."
1228,"Or the case may be put in another way, and it may be said, that in"
1228,"the larger genera, in which a number of varieties or incipient species"
1228,"greater than the average are now manufacturing, many of the species"
1228,"already manufactured still to a certain extent resemble varieties, for"
1228,they differ from each other by a less than usual amount of difference.
1228,
1228,"Moreover, the species of the large genera are related to each other, in"
1228,the same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to
1228,each other. No naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are
1228,equally distinct from each other; they may generally be divided into
1228,"sub-genera, or sections, or lesser groups. As Fries has well remarked,"
1228,little groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around
1228,"certain other species. And what are varieties but groups of forms,"
1228,"unequally related to each other, and clustered round certain forms--that"
1228,"is, round their parent-species? Undoubtedly there is one most important"
1228,"point of difference between varieties and species; namely, that the"
1228,"amount of difference between varieties, when compared with each other or"
1228,"with their parent-species, is much less than that between the species of"
1228,"the same genus. But when we come to discuss the principle, as I call it,"
1228,"of Divergence of Character, we shall see how this may be explained, and"
1228,how the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase into
1228,the greater differences between species.
1228,
1228,There is one other point which seems to me worth notice. Varieties
1228,generally have much restricted ranges: this statement is indeed scarcely
1228,"more than a truism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range"
1228,"than that of its supposed parent-species, their denominations ought to"
1228,"be reversed. But there is also reason to believe, that those species"
1228,"which are very closely allied to other species, and in so far resemble"
1228,"varieties, often have much restricted ranges. For instance, Mr. H. C."
1228,Watson has marked for me in the well-sifted London Catalogue of plants
1228,"(th edition)  plants which are therein ranked as species, but which"
1228,he considers as so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful
1228,value: these  reputed species range on an average over . of the
1228,"provinces into which Mr. Watson has divided Great Britain. Now, in this"
1228,"same catalogue,  acknowledged varieties are recorded, and these range"
1228,"over . provinces; whereas, the species to which these varieties belong"
1228,range over . provinces. So that the acknowledged varieties have very
1228,"nearly the same restricted average range, as have those very closely"
1228,"allied forms, marked for me by Mr. Watson as doubtful species, but which"
1228,are almost universally ranked by British botanists as good and true
1228,species.
1228,
1228,"Finally, then, varieties have the same general characters as species,"
1228,"for they cannot be distinguished from species,--except, firstly, by"
1228,"the discovery of intermediate linking forms, and the occurrence of"
1228,such links cannot affect the actual characters of the forms which they
1228,"connect; and except, secondly, by a certain amount of difference, for"
1228,"two forms, if differing very little, are generally ranked as varieties,"
1228,notwithstanding that intermediate linking forms have not been
1228,discovered; but the amount of difference considered necessary to give to
1228,two forms the rank of species is quite indefinite. In genera having more
1228,"than the average number of species in any country, the species of these"
1228,genera have more than the average number of varieties. In large genera
1228,"the species are apt to be closely, but unequally, allied together,"
1228,forming little clusters round certain species. Species very closely
1228,allied to other species apparently have restricted ranges. In all these
1228,several respects the species of large genera present a strong analogy
1228,"with varieties. And we can clearly understand these analogies, if"
1228,"species have once existed as varieties, and have thus originated:"
1228,"whereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each species has"
1228,been independently created.
1228,
1228,"We have, also, seen that it is the most flourishing and dominant species"
1228,"of the larger genera which on an average vary most; and varieties, as"
1228,"we shall hereafter see, tend to become converted into new and distinct"
1228,species. The larger genera thus tend to become larger; and throughout
1228,nature the forms of life which are now dominant tend to become still
1228,more dominant by leaving many modified and dominant descendants. But by
1228,"steps hereafter to be explained, the larger genera also tend to break up"
1228,"into smaller genera. And thus, the forms of life throughout the universe"
1228,become divided into groups subordinate to groups.

1228,. STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.
1228,
1228,Bears on natural selection. The term used in a wide sense. Geometrical
1228,powers of increase. Rapid increase of naturalised animals and plants.
1228,Nature of the checks to increase. Competition universal. Effects of
1228,climate. Protection from the number of individuals. Complex relations of
1228,all animals and plants throughout nature. Struggle for life most severe
1228,between individuals and varieties of the same species; often severe
1228,between species of the same genus. The relation of organism to organism
1228,the most important of all relations.
1228,
1228,"Before entering on the subject of this chapter, I must make a few"
1228,"preliminary remarks, to show how the struggle for existence bears on"
1228,Natural Selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that
1228,amongst organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual
1228,variability; indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed.
1228,It is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called
1228,"species or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or"
1228,"three hundred doubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold,"
1228,if the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted. But the
1228,mere existence of individual variability and of some few well-marked
1228,"varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but"
1228,little in understanding how species arise in nature. How have all those
1228,"exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part,"
1228,"and to the conditions of life, and of one distinct organic being to"
1228,"another being, been perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations"
1228,most plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe; and only a little
1228,less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a
1228,quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which
1228,dives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the
1228,"gentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and"
1228,in every part of the organic world.
1228,
1228,"Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called"
1228,"incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct"
1228,"species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far"
1228,more than do the varieties of the same species? How do those groups of
1228,"species, which constitute what are called distinct genera, and which"
1228,"differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus,"
1228,"arise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next"
1228,"chapter, follow inevitably from the struggle for life. Owing to this"
1228,"struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause"
1228,"proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any"
1228,"species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and"
1228,"to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual,"
1228,"and will generally be inherited by its offspring. The offspring,"
1228,"also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many"
1228,"individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small"
1228,"number can survive. I have called this principle, by which each slight"
1228,"variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection,"
1228,in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. We have seen
1228,"that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt"
1228,"organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight"
1228,"but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature. But Natural"
1228,"Selection, as we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for"
1228,"action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the"
1228,works of Nature are to those of Art.
1228,
1228,We will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence.
1228,"In my future work this subject shall be treated, as it well deserves,"
1228,at much greater length. The elder De Candolle and Lyell have largely
1228,and philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe
1228,"competition. In regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with"
1228,"more spirit and ability than W. Herbert, Dean of Manchester, evidently"
1228,the result of his great horticultural knowledge. Nothing is easier than
1228,"to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more"
1228,difficult--at least I have found it so--than constantly to bear this
1228,"conclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind,"
1228,"I am convinced that the whole economy of nature, with every fact on"
1228,"distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be"
1228,dimly seen or quite misunderstood. We behold the face of nature bright
1228,"with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or"
1228,"we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on"
1228,"insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget"
1228,"how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are"
1228,"destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind,"
1228,"that though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons"
1228,of each recurring year.
1228,
1228,I should premise that I use the term Struggle for Existence in a large
1228,"and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another,"
1228,and including (which is more important) not only the life of the
1228,"individual, but success in leaving progeny. Two canine animals in a time"
1228,"of dearth, may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get"
1228,food and live. But a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle
1228,"for life against the drought, though more properly it should be said to"
1228,be dependent on the moisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand
1228,"seeds, of which on an average only one comes to maturity, may be more"
1228,truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which
1228,already clothe the ground. The missletoe is dependent on the apple and a
1228,"few other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle"
1228,"with these trees, for if too many of these parasites grow on the same"
1228,"tree, it will languish and die. But several seedling missletoes, growing"
1228,"close together on the same branch, may more truly be said to struggle"
1228,"with each other. As the missletoe is disseminated by birds, its"
1228,existence depends on birds; and it may metaphorically be said to
1228,"struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in order to tempt birds to"
1228,devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than those of other
1228,"plants. In these several senses, which pass into each other, I use for"
1228,convenience sake the general term of struggle for existence.
1228,
1228,A struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which
1228,"all organic beings tend to increase. Every being, which during its"
1228,"natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction"
1228,"during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional"
1228,"year, otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers"
1228,would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support
1228,"the product. Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly"
1228,"survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either"
1228,"one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals"
1228,"of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life. It is the"
1228,doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and
1228,vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase
1228,"of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some"
1228,"species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all"
1228,"cannot do so, for the world would not hold them."
1228,
1228,There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally
1228,"increases at so high a rate, that if not destroyed, the earth would soon"
1228,be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding man has
1228,"doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in a few thousand years,"
1228,there would literally not be standing room for his progeny. Linnaeus has
1228,calculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds--and there is
1228,no plant so unproductive as this--and their seedlings next year produced
1228,"two, and so on, then in twenty years there would be a million plants."
1228,"The elephant is reckoned to be the slowest breeder of all known animals,"
1228,and I have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of
1228,natural increase: it will be under the mark to assume that it breeds
1228,"when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old,"
1228,"bringing forth three pair of young in this interval; if this be so,"
1228,at the end of the fifth century there would be alive fifteen million
1228,"elephants, descended from the first pair."
1228,
1228,But we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical
1228,"calculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly"
1228,"rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when"
1228,circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following
1228,seasons. Still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals
1228,of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world: if the
1228,statements of the rate of increase of slow-breeding cattle and horses
1228,"in South America, and latterly in Australia, had not been well"
1228,"authenticated, they would have been quite incredible. So it is with"
1228,plants: cases could be given of introduced plants which have become
1228,common throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years.
1228,Several of the plants now most numerous over the wide plains of La
1228,"Plata, clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of"
1228,"all other plants, have been introduced from Europe; and there are plants"
1228,"which now range in India, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, from Cape"
1228,"Comorin to the Himalaya, which have been imported from America since its"
1228,"discovery. In such cases, and endless instances could be given, no one"
1228,supposes that the fertility of these animals or plants has been
1228,suddenly and temporarily increased in any sensible degree. The obvious
1228,"explanation is that the conditions of life have been very favourable,"
1228,and that there has consequently been less destruction of the old and
1228,"young, and that nearly all the young have been enabled to breed. In such"
1228,"cases the geometrical ratio of increase, the result of which never fails"
1228,"to be surprising, simply explains the extraordinarily rapid increase and"
1228,wide diffusion of naturalised productions in their new homes.
1228,
1228,"In a state of nature almost every plant produces seed, and amongst"
1228,animals there are very few which do not annually pair. Hence we may
1228,"confidently assert, that all plants and animals are tending to increase"
1228,"at a geometrical ratio, that all would most rapidly stock every station"
1228,"in which they could any how exist, and that the geometrical tendency"
1228,to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of life. Our
1228,"familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, I think, to mislead"
1228,"us: we see no great destruction falling on them, and we forget that"
1228,"thousands are annually slaughtered for food, and that in a state of"
1228,nature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed of.
1228,
1228,The only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or
1228,"seeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is,"
1228,"that the slow-breeders would require a few more years to people, under"
1228,"favourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large. The"
1228,"condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the"
1228,same country the condor may be the more numerous of the two: the Fulmar
1228,"petrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird"
1228,"in the world. One fly deposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the"
1228,"hippobosca, a single one; but this difference does not determine how"
1228,many individuals of the two species can be supported in a district.
1228,"A large number of eggs is of some importance to those species, which"
1228,"depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them"
1228,rapidly to increase in number. But the real importance of a large number
1228,of eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at some period of
1228,life; and this period in the great majority of cases is an early one. If
1228,"an animal can in any way protect its own eggs or young, a small number"
1228,"may be produced, and yet the average stock be fully kept up; but if many"
1228,"eggs or young are destroyed, many must be produced, or the species will"
1228,"become extinct. It would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree,"
1228,"which lived on an average for a thousand years, if a single seed were"
1228,"produced once in a thousand years, supposing that this seed were never"
1228,"destroyed, and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place. So that"
1228,"in all cases, the average number of any animal or plant depends only"
1228,indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds.
1228,
1228,"In looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing"
1228,considerations always in mind--never to forget that every single organic
1228,being around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in
1228,numbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life; that
1228,"heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old, during"
1228,"each generation or at recurrent intervals. Lighten any check, mitigate"
1228,"the destruction ever so little, and the number of the species will"
1228,almost instantaneously increase to any amount. The face of Nature may
1228,"be compared to a yielding surface, with ten thousand sharp wedges packed"
1228,"close together and driven inwards by incessant blows, sometimes one"
1228,"wedge being struck, and then another with greater force."
1228,
1228,What checks the natural tendency of each species to increase in number
1228,is most obscure. Look at the most vigorous species; by as much as it
1228,"swarms in numbers, by so much will its tendency to increase be still"
1228,further increased. We know not exactly what the checks are in even
1228,one single instance. Nor will this surprise any one who reflects how
1228,"ignorant we are on this head, even in regard to mankind, so incomparably"
1228,better known than any other animal. This subject has been ably treated
1228,"by several authors, and I shall, in my future work, discuss some of the"
1228,"checks at considerable length, more especially in regard to the feral"
1228,"animals of South America. Here I will make only a few remarks, just to"
1228,recall to the reader's mind some of the chief points. Eggs or very young
1228,"animals seem generally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the"
1228,"case. With plants there is a vast destruction of seeds, but, from some"
1228,"observations which I have made, I believe that it is the seedlings which"
1228,suffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked with
1228,"other plants. Seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various"
1228,"enemies; for instance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two"
1228,"wide, dug and cleared, and where there could be no choking from other"
1228,"plants, I marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up,"
1228,"and out of the  no less than  were destroyed, chiefly by slugs"
1228,"and insects. If turf which has long been mown, and the case would be the"
1228,"same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more"
1228,"vigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown,"
1228,plants: thus out of twenty species growing on a little plot of turf
1228,(three feet by four) nine species perished from the other species being
1228,allowed to grow up freely.
1228,
1228,The amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limit
1228,to which each can increase; but very frequently it is not the obtaining
1228,"food, but the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the"
1228,"average numbers of a species. Thus, there seems to be little doubt that"
1228,"the stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends"
1228,chiefly on the destruction of vermin. If not one head of game were shot
1228,"during the next twenty years in England, and, at the same time, if no"
1228,"vermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game"
1228,"than at present, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now"
1228,"annually killed. On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant"
1228,"and rhinoceros, none are destroyed by beasts of prey: even the tiger in"
1228,India most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam.
1228,
1228,Climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a
1228,"species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought, I believe"
1228,to be the most effective of all checks. I estimated that the winter of
1228,- destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this
1228,"is a tremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent. is an"
1228,extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. The action of
1228,climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for
1228,"existence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it"
1228,"brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of"
1228,"the same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food."
1228,"Even when climate, for instance extreme cold, acts directly, it will"
1228,"be the least vigorous, or those which have got least food through the"
1228,"advancing winter, which will suffer most. When we travel from south to"
1228,"north, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably see some species"
1228,"gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the"
1228,"change of climate being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the"
1228,whole effect to its direct action. But this is a very false view: we
1228,"forget that each species, even where it most abounds, is constantly"
1228,"suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life, from enemies"
1228,or from competitors for the same place and food; and if these enemies
1228,or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of
1228,"climate, they will increase in numbers, and, as each area is already"
1228,"fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species will decrease. When"
1228,"we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers, we may feel"
1228,"sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured,"
1228,"as in this one being hurt. So it is when we travel northward, but in"
1228,"a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all kinds,"
1228,"and therefore of competitors, decreases northwards; hence in going"
1228,"northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener meet with stunted"
1228,"forms, due to the DIRECTLY injurious action of climate, than we do in"
1228,proceeding southwards or in descending a mountain. When we reach
1228,"the Arctic regions, or snow-capped summits, or absolute deserts, the"
1228,struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements.
1228,
1228,"That climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species, we"
1228,may clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens
1228,"which can perfectly well endure our climate, but which never become"
1228,"naturalised, for they cannot compete with our native plants, nor resist"
1228,destruction by our native animals.
1228,
1228,"When a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases"
1228,"inordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics--at least, this"
1228,seems generally to occur with our game animals--often ensue: and here
1228,we have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life. But even
1228,"some of these so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms,"
1228,"which have from some cause, possibly in part through facility of"
1228,"diffusion amongst the crowded animals, been disproportionably favoured:"
1228,and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey.
1228,
1228,"On the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the"
1228,"same species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely"
1228,necessary for its preservation. Thus we can easily raise plenty of
1228,"corn and rape-seed, etc., in our fields, because the seeds are in great"
1228,excess compared with the number of birds which feed on them; nor can
1228,"the birds, though having a superabundance of food at this one season,"
1228,"increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their"
1228,"numbers are checked during winter: but any one who has tried, knows how"
1228,troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants in
1228,a garden; I have in this case lost every single seed. This view of the
1228,"necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation,"
1228,"explains, I believe, some singular facts in nature, such as that of very"
1228,rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant in the few spots where
1228,"they do occur; and that of some social plants being social, that is,"
1228,"abounding in individuals, even on the extreme confines of their range."
1228,"For in such cases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where"
1228,the conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist
1228,"together, and thus save each other from utter destruction. I should add"
1228,"that the good effects of frequent intercrossing, and the ill effects of"
1228,"close interbreeding, probably come into play in some of these cases; but"
1228,on this intricate subject I will not here enlarge.
1228,
1228,Many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the
1228,"checks and relations between organic beings, which have to struggle"
1228,"together in the same country. I will give only a single instance, which,"
1228,"though a simple one, has interested me. In Staffordshire, on the estate"
1228,"of a relation where I had ample means of investigation, there was a"
1228,"large and extremely barren heath, which had never been touched by the"
1228,hand of man; but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had
1228,been enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch fir.
1228,The change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was
1228,"most remarkable, more than is generally seen in passing from one quite"
1228,different soil to another: not only the proportional numbers of the
1228,"heath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants (not"
1228,"counting grasses and carices) flourished in the plantations, which could"
1228,not be found on the heath. The effect on the insects must have been
1228,"still greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common in the"
1228,"plantations, which were not to be seen on the heath; and the heath was"
1228,frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds. Here we see how
1228,"potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree, nothing"
1228,"whatever else having been done, with the exception that the land had"
1228,"been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. But how important an"
1228,"element enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey. Here"
1228,"there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on"
1228,the distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been
1228,"enclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so"
1228,close together that all cannot live.
1228,
1228,"When I ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted,"
1228,I was so much surprised at their numbers that I went to several points
1228,"of view, whence I could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed"
1228,"heath, and literally I could not see a single Scotch fir, except the old"
1228,"planted clumps. But on looking closely between the stems of the heath,"
1228,"I found a multitude of seedlings and little trees, which had been"
1228,"perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square yard, at a"
1228,"point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, I counted"
1228,"thirty-two little trees; and one of them, judging from the rings of"
1228,"growth, had during twenty-six years tried to raise its head above the"
1228,"stems of the heath, and had failed. No wonder that, as soon as the land"
1228,"was enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young"
1228,firs. Yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no
1228,one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and
1228,effectually searched it for food.
1228,
1228,Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch
1228,fir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence
1228,of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this;
1228,"for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though"
1228,they swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and Azara and
1228,Rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay
1228,"of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals"
1228,"when first born. The increase of these flies, numerous as they are,"
1228,"must be habitually checked by some means, probably by birds. Hence, if"
1228,certain insectivorous birds (whose numbers are probably regulated by
1228,"hawks or beasts of prey) were to increase in Paraguay, the flies would"
1228,"decrease--then cattle and horses would become feral, and this would"
1228,certainly greatly alter (as indeed I have observed in parts of South
1228,America) the vegetation: this again would largely affect the insects;
1228,"and this, as we just have seen in Staffordshire, the insectivorous"
1228,"birds, and so onwards in ever-increasing circles of complexity. We began"
1228,"this series by insectivorous birds, and we have ended with them. Not"
1228,that in nature the relations can ever be as simple as this. Battle
1228,within battle must ever be recurring with varying success; and yet in
1228,"the long-run the forces are so nicely balanced, that the face of nature"
1228,"remains uniform for long periods of time, though assuredly the merest"
1228,trifle would often give the victory to one organic being over another.
1228,"Nevertheless so profound is our ignorance, and so high our presumption,"
1228,that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being; and
1228,"as we do not see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world,"
1228,or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life!
1228,
1228,"I am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals,"
1228,"most remote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of"
1228,complex relations. I shall hereafter have occasion to show that the
1228,"exotic Lobelia fulgens, in this part of England, is never visited by"
1228,"insects, and consequently, from its peculiar structure, never can set a"
1228,seed. Many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of
1228,moths to remove their pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. I
1228,"have, also, reason to believe that humble-bees are indispensable to the"
1228,"fertilisation of the heartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do not"
1228,"visit this flower. From experiments which I have tried, I have found"
1228,"that the visits of bees, if not indispensable, are at least highly"
1228,beneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers; but humble-bees alone
1228,"visit the common red clover (Trifolium pratense), as other bees cannot"
1228,"reach the nectar. Hence I have very little doubt, that if the whole"
1228,"genus of humble-bees became extinct or very rare in England, the"
1228,"heartsease and red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear."
1228,The number of humble-bees in any district depends in a great degree on
1228,"the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and Mr."
1228,"H. Newman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes"
1228,"that ""more than two thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England."""
1228,"Now the number of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the"
1228,"number of cats; and Mr. Newman says, ""Near villages and small towns I"
1228,"have found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which"
1228,"I attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice."" Hence it is"
1228,quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in
1228,"a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and"
1228,"then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district!"
1228,
1228,"In the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different"
1228,"periods of life, and during different seasons or years, probably come"
1228,"into play; some one check or some few being generally the most potent,"
1228,but all concurring in determining the average number or even
1228,the existence of the species. In some cases it can be shown that
1228,widely-different checks act on the same species in different districts.
1228,"When we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank, we"
1228,are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we
1228,call chance. But how false a view is this! Every one has heard that when
1228,"an American forest is cut down, a very different vegetation springs"
1228,up; but it has been observed that the trees now growing on the ancient
1228,"Indian mounds, in the Southern United States, display the same beautiful"
1228,diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests.
1228,What a struggle between the several kinds of trees must here have gone
1228,"on during long centuries, each annually scattering its seeds by the"
1228,"thousand; what war between insect and insect--between insects, snails,"
1228,and other animals with birds and beasts of prey--all striving to
1228,"increase, and all feeding on each other or on the trees or their seeds"
1228,"and seedlings, or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and"
1228,"thus checked the growth of the trees! Throw up a handful of feathers,"
1228,and all must fall to the ground according to definite laws; but how
1228,simple is this problem compared to the action and reaction of the
1228,"innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in the course of"
1228,"centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on"
1228,the old Indian ruins!
1228,
1228,"The dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its"
1228,"prey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature. This"
1228,is often the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle with
1228,"each other for existence, as in the case of locusts and grass-feeding"
1228,quadrupeds. But the struggle almost invariably will be most severe
1228,"between the individuals of the same species, for they frequent the same"
1228,"districts, require the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers."
1228,"In the case of varieties of the same species, the struggle will"
1228,"generally be almost equally severe, and we sometimes see the contest"
1228,"soon decided: for instance, if several varieties of wheat be sown"
1228,"together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties which best"
1228,"suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile, will beat"
1228,"the others and so yield more seed, and will consequently in a few years"
1228,quite supplant the other varieties. To keep up a mixed stock of even
1228,"such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweet-peas,"
1228,"they must be each year harvested separately, and the seed then mixed"
1228,"in due proportion, otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in"
1228,numbers and disappear. So again with the varieties of sheep: it has
1228,been asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out other
1228,"mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept together. The same"
1228,result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the
1228,medicinal leech. It may even be doubted whether the varieties of any
1228,"one of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength,"
1228,"habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a mixed stock"
1228,"could be kept up for half a dozen generations, if they were allowed to"
1228,"struggle together, like beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or"
1228,young were not annually sorted.
1228,
1228,"As species of the same genus have usually, though by no means"
1228,"invariably, some similarity in habits and constitution, and always in"
1228,"structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between species"
1228,"of the same genus, when they come into competition with each other, than"
1228,between species of distinct genera. We see this in the recent extension
1228,over parts of the United States of one species of swallow having
1228,caused the decrease of another species. The recent increase of the
1228,missel-thrush in parts of Scotland has caused the decrease of the
1228,song-thrush. How frequently we hear of one species of rat taking the
1228,place of another species under the most different climates! In Russia
1228,the small Asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its great
1228,"congener. One species of charlock will supplant another, and so in"
1228,other cases. We can dimly see why the competition should be most severe
1228,"between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in the economy"
1228,of nature; but probably in no one case could we precisely say why one
1228,species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life.
1228,
1228,A corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing
1228,"remarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being is related,"
1228,"in the most essential yet often hidden manner, to that of all other"
1228,"organic beings, with which it comes into competition for food or"
1228,"residence, or from which it has to escape, or on which it preys. This"
1228,is obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger; and in
1228,that of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair on
1228,"the tiger's body. But in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion,"
1228,"and in the flattened and fringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation"
1228,seems at first confined to the elements of air and water. Yet the
1228,advantage of plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation to the
1228,land being already thickly clothed by other plants; so that the
1228,seeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground. In the
1228,"water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well adapted for diving,"
1228,"allows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to hunt for its own"
1228,"prey, and to escape serving as prey to other animals."
1228,
1228,The store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at
1228,first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants. But from the
1228,strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds (as peas and
1228,"beans), when sown in the midst of long grass, I suspect that the chief"
1228,use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young
1228,"seedling, whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously all"
1228,around.
1228,
1228,"Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or"
1228,quadruple its numbers? We know that it can perfectly well withstand a
1228,"little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges"
1228,"into slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. In this case"
1228,we can clearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plant
1228,"the power of increasing in number, we should have to give it some"
1228,"advantage over its competitors, or over the animals which preyed on it."
1228,"On the confines of its geographical range, a change of constitution with"
1228,respect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant; but we
1228,"have reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far,"
1228,that they are destroyed by the rigour of the climate alone. Not until
1228,"we reach the extreme confines of life, in the arctic regions or on the"
1228,"borders of an utter desert, will competition cease. The land may be"
1228,"extremely cold or dry, yet there will be competition between some few"
1228,"species, or between the individuals of the same species, for the warmest"
1228,or dampest spots.
1228,
1228,"Hence, also, we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new"
1228,"country amongst new competitors, though the climate may be exactly"
1228,"the same as in its former home, yet the conditions of its life will"
1228,generally be changed in an essential manner. If we wished to increase
1228,"its average numbers in its new home, we should have to modify it in a"
1228,different way to what we should have done in its native country; for
1228,we should have to give it some advantage over a different set of
1228,competitors or enemies.
1228,
1228,It is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some
1228,advantage over another. Probably in no single instance should we know
1228,"what to do, so as to succeed. It will convince us of our ignorance on"
1228,"the mutual relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary,"
1228,"as it seems to be difficult to acquire. All that we can do, is to keep"
1228,steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase at a
1228,"geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its life, during some"
1228,"season of the year, during each generation or at intervals, has to"
1228,"struggle for life, and to suffer great destruction. When we reflect on"
1228,"this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the"
1228,"war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is"
1228,"generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy"
1228,survive and multiply.

1228,
1228,NATURAL SELECTION.
1228,
1228,"Natural Selection: its power compared with man's selection, its power"
1228,"on characters of trifling importance, its power at all ages and on"
1228,both sexes. Sexual Selection. On the generality of intercrosses
1228,between individuals of the same species. Circumstances favourable and
1228,"unfavourable to Natural Selection, namely, intercrossing, isolation,"
1228,number of individuals. Slow action. Extinction caused by Natural
1228,"Selection. Divergence of Character, related to the diversity of"
1228,"inhabitants of any small area, and to naturalisation. Action of Natural"
1228,"Selection, through Divergence of Character and Extinction, on the"
1228,descendants from a common parent. Explains the Grouping of all organic
1228,beings.
1228,
1228,"How will the struggle for existence, discussed too briefly in the last"
1228,"chapter, act in regard to variation? Can the principle of selection,"
1228,"which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply in nature? I"
1228,think we shall see that it can act most effectually. Let it be borne
1228,in mind in what an endless number of strange peculiarities our domestic
1228,"productions, and, in a lesser degree, those under nature, vary; and how"
1228,"strong the hereditary tendency is. Under domestication, it may be truly"
1228,said that the whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic. Let it
1228,be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual
1228,relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical
1228,"conditions of life. Can it, then, be thought improbable, seeing"
1228,"that variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other"
1228,variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex
1228,"battle of life, should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of"
1228,"generations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more"
1228,individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having
1228,"any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance"
1228,"of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may"
1228,feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be
1228,rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable variations and the
1228,"rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations"
1228,"neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection,"
1228,"and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in the"
1228,species called polymorphic.
1228,
1228,We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection
1228,"by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for"
1228,"instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would"
1228,"almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become"
1228,"extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and"
1228,complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound
1228,"together, that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the"
1228,"inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would most"
1228,seriously affect many of the others. If the country were open on its
1228,"borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this also would"
1228,seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let
1228,it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree
1228,"or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a"
1228,"country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted"
1228,"forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy"
1228,"of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of the"
1228,"original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area"
1228,"been open to immigration, these same places would have been seized on by"
1228,"intruders. In such case, every slight modification, which in the course"
1228,"of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals"
1228,"of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered"
1228,"conditions, would tend to be preserved; and natural selection would thus"
1228,have free scope for the work of improvement.
1228,
1228,"We have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change"
1228,"in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive"
1228,"system, causes or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the"
1228,"conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a change, and this"
1228,"would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by giving a"
1228,better chance of profitable variations occurring; and unless profitable
1228,"variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing. Not that, as"
1228,"I believe, any extreme amount of variability is necessary; as man can"
1228,certainly produce great results by adding up in any given direction
1228,"mere individual differences, so could Nature, but far more easily, from"
1228,having incomparably longer time at her disposal. Nor do I believe that
1228,"any great physical change, as of climate, or any unusual degree of"
1228,"isolation to check immigration, is actually necessary to produce new"
1228,and unoccupied places for natural selection to fill up by modifying and
1228,improving some of the varying inhabitants. For as all the inhabitants
1228,"of each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces,"
1228,extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one
1228,inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others; and still
1228,further modifications of the same kind would often still further
1228,increase the advantage. No country can be named in which all the native
1228,inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the
1228,"physical conditions under which they live, that none of them could"
1228,"anyhow be improved; for in all countries, the natives have been so far"
1228,"conquered by naturalised productions, that they have allowed foreigners"
1228,to take firm possession of the land. And as foreigners have thus
1228,"everywhere beaten some of the natives, we may safely conclude that the"
1228,"natives might have been modified with advantage, so as to have better"
1228,resisted such intruders.
1228,
1228,As man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his
1228,"methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not nature"
1228,effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters: nature
1228,"cares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful"
1228,"to any being. She can act on every internal organ, on every shade of"
1228,"constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of life. Man selects"
1228,only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she
1228,tends. Every selected character is fully exercised by her; and the being
1228,is placed under well-suited conditions of life. Man keeps the natives
1228,of many climates in the same country; he seldom exercises each selected
1228,character in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a
1228,short beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed
1228,or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with
1228,long and short wool to the same climate. He does not allow the most
1228,vigorous males to struggle for the females. He does not rigidly destroy
1228,"all inferior animals, but protects during each varying season, as far as"
1228,"lies in his power, all his productions. He often begins his selection"
1228,by some half-monstrous form; or at least by some modification prominent
1228,"enough to catch his eye, or to be plainly useful to him. Under nature,"
1228,the slightest difference of structure or constitution may well turn the
1228,"nicely-balanced scale in the struggle for life, and so be preserved."
1228,How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! how short his time!
1228,"and consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those"
1228,"accumulated by nature during whole geological periods. Can we wonder,"
1228,"then, that nature's productions should be far ""truer"" in character than"
1228,man's productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the
1228,"most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of"
1228,far higher workmanship?
1228,
1228,"It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising,"
1228,"throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting"
1228,"that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently"
1228,"and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at"
1228,the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and
1228,inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in
1228,"progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages, and"
1228,"then so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages, that"
1228,we only see that the forms of life are now different from what they
1228,formerly were.
1228,
1228,Although natural selection can act only through and for the good of each
1228,"being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider as of"
1228,"very trifling importance, may thus be acted on. When we see leaf-eating"
1228,"insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white"
1228,"in winter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, and the black-grouse"
1228,"that of peaty earth, we must believe that these tints are of service to"
1228,"these birds and insects in preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not"
1228,"destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in countless"
1228,numbers; they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey; and hawks
1228,"are guided by eyesight to their prey,--so much so, that on parts of the"
1228,"Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the"
1228,most liable to destruction. Hence I can see no reason to doubt that
1228,natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour
1228,"to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired,"
1228,true and constant. Nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction
1228,of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect: we
1228,should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy
1228,every lamb with the faintest trace of black. In plants the down on
1228,the fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by botanists
1228,as characters of the most trifling importance: yet we hear from
1228,"an excellent horticulturist, Downing, that in the United States"
1228,"smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a curculio, than"
1228,those with down; that purple plums suffer far more from a certain
1228,disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks
1228,yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh.
1228,"If, with all the aids of art, these slight differences make a great"
1228,"difference in cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a state"
1228,"of nature, where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and"
1228,"with a host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle which"
1228,"variety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or purple fleshed fruit,"
1228,should succeed.
1228,
1228,"In looking at many small points of difference between species, which, as"
1228,"far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem to be quite unimportant,"
1228,"we must not forget that climate, food, etc., probably produce some"
1228,"slight and direct effect. It is, however, far more necessary to bear in"
1228,"mind that there are many unknown laws of correlation of growth, which,"
1228,"when one part of the organisation is modified through variation, and the"
1228,modifications are accumulated by natural selection for the good of the
1228,"being, will cause other modifications, often of the most unexpected"
1228,nature.
1228,
1228,As we see that those variations which under domestication appear at any
1228,"particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the"
1228,"same period;--for instance, in the seeds of the many varieties of our"
1228,culinary and agricultural plants; in the caterpillar and cocoon stages
1228,"of the varieties of the silkworm; in the eggs of poultry, and in the"
1228,colour of the down of their chickens; in the horns of our sheep and
1228,"cattle when nearly adult;--so in a state of nature, natural selection"
1228,"will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age, by"
1228,"the accumulation of profitable variations at that age, and by their"
1228,inheritance at a corresponding age. If it profit a plant to have its
1228,"seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind, I can see no"
1228,"greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection,"
1228,than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by selection the
1228,down in the pods on his cotton-trees. Natural selection may modify
1228,"and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies,"
1228,wholly different from those which concern the mature insect. These
1228,"modifications will no doubt affect, through the laws of correlation, the"
1228,structure of the adult; and probably in the case of those insects which
1228,"live only for a few hours, and which never feed, a large part of their"
1228,structure is merely the correlated result of successive changes in the
1228,"structure of their larvae. So, conversely, modifications in the adult"
1228,will probably often affect the structure of the larva; but in all cases
1228,natural selection will ensure that modifications consequent on other
1228,"modifications at a different period of life, shall not be in the least"
1228,"degree injurious: for if they became so, they would cause the extinction"
1228,of the species.
1228,
1228,Natural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation
1228,"to the parent, and of the parent in relation to the young. In social"
1228,animals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit
1228,of the community; if each in consequence profits by the selected change.
1228,"What natural selection cannot do, is to modify the structure of one"
1228,"species, without giving it any advantage, for the good of another"
1228,species; and though statements to this effect may be found in works of
1228,"natural history, I cannot find one case which will bear investigation."
1228,"A structure used only once in an animal's whole life, if of high"
1228,"importance to it, might be modified to any extent by natural selection;"
1228,"for instance, the great jaws possessed by certain insects, and used"
1228,exclusively for opening the cocoon--or the hard tip to the beak of
1228,"nestling birds, used for breaking the egg. It has been asserted, that"
1228,of the best short-beaked tumbler-pigeons more perish in the egg than are
1228,able to get out of it; so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching.
1228,"Now, if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short"
1228,"for the bird's own advantage, the process of modification would be very"
1228,"slow, and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of"
1228,"the young birds within the egg, which had the most powerful and hardest"
1228,"beaks, for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or, more"
1228,"delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected, the thickness"
1228,of the shell being known to vary like every other structure.
1228,
1228,SEXUAL SELECTION.
1228,
1228,Inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex
1228,"and become hereditarily attached to that sex, the same fact probably"
1228,"occurs under nature, and if so, natural selection will be able to modify"
1228,"one sex in its functional relations to the other sex, or in relation to"
1228,"wholly different habits of life in the two sexes, as is sometimes the"
1228,case with insects. And this leads me to say a few words on what I call
1228,"Sexual Selection. This depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on"
1228,a struggle between the males for possession of the females; the result
1228,"is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring."
1228,"Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than natural selection."
1228,"Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are best fitted for"
1228,"their places in nature, will leave most progeny. But in many cases,"
1228,"victory will depend not on general vigour, but on having special"
1228,"weapons, confined to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless cock"
1228,would have a poor chance of leaving offspring. Sexual selection by
1228,always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable
1228,"courage, length to the spur, and strength to the wing to strike in the"
1228,"spurred leg, as well as the brutal cock-fighter, who knows well that he"
1228,can improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks. How low
1228,"in the scale of nature this law of battle descends, I know not; male"
1228,"alligators have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling"
1228,"round, like Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females;"
1228,male salmons have been seen fighting all day long; male stag-beetles
1228,"often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males. The war is,"
1228,"perhaps, severest between the males of polygamous animals, and these"
1228,seem oftenest provided with special weapons. The males of carnivorous
1228,"animals are already well armed; though to them and to others, special"
1228,"means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection, as the"
1228,"mane to the lion, the shoulder-pad to the boar, and the hooked jaw to"
1228,"the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory, as the"
1228,sword or spear.
1228,
1228,"Amongst birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character."
1228,"All those who have attended to the subject, believe that there is the"
1228,severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing
1228,"the females. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of Paradise, and some"
1228,"others, congregate; and successive males display their gorgeous plumage"
1228,"and perform strange antics before the females, which standing by as"
1228,"spectators, at last choose the most attractive partner. Those who have"
1228,closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they often take
1228,individual preferences and dislikes: thus Sir R. Heron has described how
1228,one pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds. It may
1228,appear childish to attribute any effect to such apparently weak means: I
1228,cannot here enter on the details necessary to support this view; but if
1228,"man can in a short time give elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams,"
1228,"according to his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt"
1228,"that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations,"
1228,"the most melodious or beautiful males, according to their standard of"
1228,"beauty, might produce a marked effect. I strongly suspect that some"
1228,"well-known laws with respect to the plumage of male and female birds, in"
1228,"comparison with the plumage of the young, can be explained on the view"
1228,"of plumage having been chiefly modified by sexual selection, acting when"
1228,the birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season;
1228,the modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages or
1228,"seasons, either by the males alone, or by the males and females; but I"
1228,have not space here to enter on this subject.
1228,
1228,"Thus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any animal"
1228,"have the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour,"
1228,"or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual"
1228,"selection; that is, individual males have had, in successive"
1228,"generations, some slight advantage over other males, in their weapons,"
1228,"means of defence, or charms; and have transmitted these advantages to"
1228,"their male offspring. Yet, I would not wish to attribute all such"
1228,sexual differences to this agency: for we see peculiarities arising and
1228,becoming attached to the male sex in our domestic animals (as the wattle
1228,"in male carriers, horn-like protuberances in the cocks of certain fowls,"
1228,"etc.), which we cannot believe to be either useful to the males in"
1228,"battle, or attractive to the females. We see analogous cases under"
1228,"nature, for instance, the tuft of hair on the breast of the turkey-cock,"
1228,"which can hardly be either useful or ornamental to this bird;--indeed,"
1228,"had the tuft appeared under domestication, it would have been called a"
1228,monstrosity.
1228,
1228,ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE ACTION OF NATURAL SELECTION.
1228,
1228,"In order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural selection acts, I"
1228,must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations. Let us
1228,"take the case of a wolf, which preys on various animals, securing some"
1228,"by craft, some by strength, and some by fleetness; and let us suppose"
1228,"that the fleetest prey, a deer for instance, had from any change in"
1228,"the country increased in numbers, or that other prey had decreased in"
1228,"numbers, during that season of the year when the wolf is hardest pressed"
1228,for food. I can under such circumstances see no reason to doubt that the
1228,"swiftest and slimmest wolves would have the best chance of surviving,"
1228,"and so be preserved or selected,--provided always that they retained"
1228,strength to master their prey at this or at some other period of the
1228,"year, when they might be compelled to prey on other animals. I can see"
1228,"no more reason to doubt this, than that man can improve the fleetness"
1228,"of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by that"
1228,unconscious selection which results from each man trying to keep the
1228,best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed.
1228,
1228,Even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on
1228,"which our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to"
1228,pursue certain kinds of prey. Nor can this be thought very improbable;
1228,for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our
1228,"domestic animals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another"
1228,"mice; one cat, according to Mr. St. John, bringing home winged game,"
1228,"another hares or rabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and"
1228,almost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes. The tendency to catch rats
1228,"rather than mice is known to be inherited. Now, if any slight innate"
1228,"change of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf, it would"
1228,have the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring. Some of its
1228,"young would probably inherit the same habits or structure, and by the"
1228,"repetition of this process, a new variety might be formed which would"
1228,"either supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf. Or, again,"
1228,"the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those frequenting the"
1228,"lowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey; and from the"
1228,"continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites,"
1228,two varieties might slowly be formed. These varieties would cross and
1228,blend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon
1228,"have to return. I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two"
1228,varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the United
1228,"States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and"
1228,"the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks"
1228,the shepherd's flocks.
1228,
1228,Let us now take a more complex case. Certain plants excrete a sweet
1228,"juice, apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from"
1228,their sap: this is effected by glands at the base of the stipules in
1228,"some Leguminosae, and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel. This"
1228,"juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects. Let us"
1228,now suppose a little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner
1228,bases of the petals of a flower. In this case insects in seeking the
1228,"nectar would get dusted with pollen, and would certainly often transport"
1228,the pollen from one flower to the stigma of another flower. The flowers
1228,of two distinct individuals of the same species would thus get crossed;
1228,"and the act of crossing, we have good reason to believe (as will"
1228,"hereafter be more fully alluded to), would produce very vigorous"
1228,"seedlings, which consequently would have the best chance of flourishing"
1228,and surviving. Some of these seedlings would probably inherit the
1228,nectar-excreting power. Those individual flowers which had the largest
1228,"glands or nectaries, and which excreted most nectar, would be oftenest"
1228,"visited by insects, and would be oftenest crossed; and so in the"
1228,"long-run would gain the upper hand. Those flowers, also, which had their"
1228,"stamens and pistils placed, in relation to the size and habits of the"
1228,"particular insects which visited them, so as to favour in any degree"
1228,"the transportal of their pollen from flower to flower, would likewise be"
1228,favoured or selected. We might have taken the case of insects visiting
1228,flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar; and as
1228,"pollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation, its destruction"
1228,"appears a simple loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen were carried,"
1228,"at first occasionally and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring"
1228,"insects from flower to flower, and a cross thus effected, although"
1228,"nine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed, it might still be a great gain"
1228,"to the plant; and those individuals which produced more and more pollen,"
1228,"and had larger and larger anthers, would be selected."
1228,
1228,"When our plant, by this process of the continued preservation or natural"
1228,"selection of more and more attractive flowers, had been rendered highly"
1228,"attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their part,"
1228,regularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and that they can most
1228,"effectually do this, I could easily show by many striking instances."
1228,"I will give only one--not as a very striking case, but as likewise"
1228,"illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of plants,"
1228,"presently to be alluded to. Some holly-trees bear only male flowers,"
1228,"which have four stamens producing rather a small quantity of pollen, and"
1228,a rudimentary pistil; other holly-trees bear only female flowers; these
1228,"have a full-sized pistil, and four stamens with shrivelled anthers, in"
1228,which not a grain of pollen can be detected. Having found a female
1228,"tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree, I put the stigmas of twenty"
1228,"flowers, taken from different branches, under the microscope, and"
1228,"on all, without exception, there were pollen-grains, and on some a"
1228,profusion of pollen. As the wind had set for several days from the
1228,"female to the male tree, the pollen could not thus have been carried."
1228,"The weather had been cold and boisterous, and therefore not favourable"
1228,"to bees, nevertheless every female flower which I examined had been"
1228,"effectually fertilised by the bees, accidentally dusted with pollen,"
1228,having flown from tree to tree in search of nectar. But to return to
1228,our imaginary case: as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly
1228,attractive to insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower
1228,"to flower, another process might commence. No naturalist doubts the"
1228,"advantage of what has been called the ""physiological division of"
1228,"labour;"" hence we may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant"
1228,"to produce stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant, and"
1228,pistils alone in another flower or on another plant. In plants under
1228,"culture and placed under new conditions of life, sometimes the male"
1228,organs and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent;
1228,"now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature,"
1228,"then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower,"
1228,and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be
1228,"advantageous on the principle of the division of labour, individuals"
1228,"with this tendency more and more increased, would be continually"
1228,"favoured or selected, until at last a complete separation of the sexes"
1228,would be effected.
1228,
1228,Let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects in our imaginary case: we
1228,may suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar
1228,"by continued selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects"
1228,"depended in main part on its nectar for food. I could give many facts,"
1228,"showing how anxious bees are to save time; for instance, their habit of"
1228,"cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers,"
1228,"which they can, with a very little more trouble, enter by the mouth."
1228,"Bearing such facts in mind, I can see no reason to doubt that an"
1228,"accidental deviation in the size and form of the body, or in the"
1228,"curvature and length of the proboscis, etc., far too slight to be"
1228,"appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other insect, so that an"
1228,individual so characterised would be able to obtain its food more
1228,"quickly, and so have a better chance of living and leaving descendants."
1228,Its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a similar slight
1228,deviation of structure. The tubes of the corollas of the common red and
1228,incarnate clovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a hasty
1228,glance appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily suck
1228,"the nectar out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red"
1228,"clover, which is visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of"
1228,the red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to
1228,the hive-bee. Thus it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have
1228,a slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis. On the other
1228,"hand, I have found by experiment that the fertility of clover greatly"
1228,"depends on bees visiting and moving parts of the corolla, so as to push"
1228,"the pollen on to the stigmatic surface. Hence, again, if humble-bees"
1228,"were to become rare in any country, it might be a great advantage to the"
1228,"red clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla,"
1228,so that the hive-bee could visit its flowers. Thus I can understand how
1228,"a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one"
1228,"after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each"
1228,"other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual"
1228,and slightly favourable deviations of structure.
1228,
1228,"I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in"
1228,"the above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which were"
1228,"at first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's noble views on ""the modern"
1228,"changes of the earth, as illustrative of geology;"" but we now very"
1228,"seldom hear the action, for instance, of the coast-waves, called a"
1228,"trifling and insignificant cause, when applied to the excavation of"
1228,gigantic valleys or to the formation of the longest lines of inland
1228,cliffs. Natural selection can act only by the preservation and
1228,"accumulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications, each"
1228,profitable to the preserved being; and as modern geology has almost
1228,banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single
1228,"diluvial wave, so will natural selection, if it be a true principle,"
1228,"banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of"
1228,any great and sudden modification in their structure.
1228,
1228,ON THE INTERCROSSING OF INDIVIDUALS.
1228,
1228,I must here introduce a short digression. In the case of animals
1228,"and plants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two"
1228,individuals must always unite for each birth; but in the case of
1228,hermaphrodites this is far from obvious. Nevertheless I am strongly
1228,"inclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals, either"
1228,"occasionally or habitually, concur for the reproduction of their kind."
1228,"This view, I may add, was first suggested by Andrew Knight. We shall"
1228,presently see its importance; but I must here treat the subject with
1228,"extreme brevity, though I have the materials prepared for an ample"
1228,"discussion. All vertebrate animals, all insects, and some other large"
1228,"groups of animals, pair for each birth. Modern research has much"
1228,"diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites, and of real"
1228,"hermaphrodites a large number pair; that is, two individuals regularly"
1228,"unite for reproduction, which is all that concerns us. But still there"
1228,"are many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair,"
1228,"and a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites. What reason, it may be"
1228,"asked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever"
1228,"concur in reproduction? As it is impossible here to enter on details, I"
1228,must trust to some general considerations alone.
1228,
1228,"In the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts, showing,"
1228,"in accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders, that with"
1228,"animals and plants a cross between different varieties, or between"
1228,"individuals of the same variety but of another strain, gives vigour"
1228,"and fertility to the offspring; and on the other hand, that CLOSE"
1228,interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility; that these facts alone
1228,incline me to believe that it is a general law of nature (utterly
1228,ignorant though we be of the meaning of the law) that no organic being
1228,self-fertilises itself for an eternity of generations; but that a
1228,cross with another individual is occasionally--perhaps at very long
1228,intervals--indispensable.
1228,
1228,"On the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think, understand"
1228,"several large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any"
1228,other view are inexplicable. Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable
1228,"exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a"
1228,multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to
1228,"the weather! but if an occasional cross be indispensable, the fullest"
1228,freedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will explain
1228,"this state of exposure, more especially as the plant's own anthers and"
1228,pistil generally stand so close together that self-fertilisation seems
1228,"almost inevitable. Many flowers, on the other hand, have their organs"
1228,"of fructification closely enclosed, as in the great papilionaceous or"
1228,"pea-family; but in several, perhaps in all, such flowers, there is a"
1228,very curious adaptation between the structure of the flower and the
1228,"manner in which bees suck the nectar; for, in doing this, they either"
1228,"push the flower's own pollen on the stigma, or bring pollen from another"
1228,"flower. So necessary are the visits of bees to papilionaceous flowers,"
1228,"that I have found, by experiments published elsewhere, that their"
1228,"fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be prevented. Now, it"
1228,"is scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to flower, and not"
1228,"carry pollen from one to the other, to the great good, as I believe,"
1228,"of the plant. Bees will act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is quite"
1228,sufficient just to touch the anthers of one flower and then the stigma
1228,of another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation; but it must not
1228,be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between
1228,distinct species; for if you bring on the same brush a plant's own
1228,"pollen and pollen from another species, the former will have such a"
1228,"prepotent effect, that it will invariably and completely destroy, as has"
1228,"been shown by Gartner, any influence from the foreign pollen."
1228,
1228,"When the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or"
1228,"slowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems"
1228,adapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful
1228,"for this end: but, the agency of insects is often required to cause the"
1228,"stamens to spring forward, as Kolreuter has shown to be the case with"
1228,"the barberry; and curiously in this very genus, which seems to have a"
1228,"special contrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known that if"
1228,"very closely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each other, it"
1228,"is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do they"
1228,"naturally cross. In many other cases, far from there being any aids for"
1228,"self-fertilisation, there are special contrivances, as I could show"
1228,"from the writings of C. C. Sprengel and from my own observations, which"
1228,effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own flower: for
1228,"instance, in Lobelia fulgens, there is a really beautiful and"
1228,elaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely numerous
1228,"pollen-granules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower,"
1228,before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive them;
1228,"and as this flower is never visited, at least in my garden, by insects,"
1228,"it never sets a seed, though by placing pollen from one flower on the"
1228,"stigma of another, I raised plenty of seedlings; and whilst another"
1228,"species of Lobelia growing close by, which is visited by bees, seeds"
1228,"freely. In very many other cases, though there be no special mechanical"
1228,"contrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own pollen,"
1228,"yet, as C. C. Sprengel has shown, and as I can confirm, either the"
1228,"anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the"
1228,"stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that these"
1228,"plants have in fact separated sexes, and must habitually be crossed."
1228,How strange are these facts! How strange that the pollen and stigmatic
1228,"surface of the same flower, though placed so close together, as if"
1228,"for the very purpose of self-fertilisation, should in so many cases be"
1228,mutually useless to each other! How simply are these facts explained
1228,on the view of an occasional cross with a distinct individual being
1228,advantageous or indispensable!
1228,
1228,"If several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some other"
1228,"plants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority, as I"
1228,"have found, of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels: for"
1228,"instance, I raised  seedling cabbages from some plants of different"
1228,"varieties growing near each other, and of these only  were true to"
1228,"their kind, and some even of these were not perfectly true. Yet the"
1228,pistil of each cabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six
1228,"stamens, but by those of the many other flowers on the same plant. How,"
1228,"then, comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized?"
1228,I suspect that it must arise from the pollen of a distinct VARIETY
1228,having a prepotent effect over a flower's own pollen; and that this is
1228,part of the general law of good being derived from the intercrossing
1228,of distinct individuals of the same species. When distinct SPECIES are
1228,"crossed the case is directly the reverse, for a plant's own pollen"
1228,is always prepotent over foreign pollen; but to this subject we shall
1228,return in a future chapter.
1228,
1228,"In the case of a gigantic tree covered with innumerable flowers, it may"
1228,"be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and"
1228,"at most only from flower to flower on the same tree, and that flowers"
1228,on the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a
1228,"limited sense. I believe this objection to be valid, but that nature has"
1228,largely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear
1228,"flowers with separated sexes. When the sexes are separated, although"
1228,"the male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree, we can see"
1228,that pollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower; and this
1228,will give a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree
1228,to tree. That trees belonging to all Orders have their sexes more often
1228,"separated than other plants, I find to be the case in this country; and"
1228,"at my request Dr. Hooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand, and Dr. Asa"
1228,"Gray those of the United States, and the result was as I anticipated. On"
1228,"the other hand, Dr. Hooker has recently informed me that he finds that"
1228,the rule does not hold in Australia; and I have made these few remarks
1228,on the sexes of trees simply to call attention to the subject.
1228,
1228,Turning for a very brief space to animals: on the land there are some
1228,"hermaphrodites, as land-mollusca and earth-worms; but these all pair."
1228,As yet I have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal which
1228,"fertilises itself. We can understand this remarkable fact, which"
1228,"offers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants, on the view of an"
1228,"occasional cross being indispensable, by considering the medium in which"
1228,"terrestrial animals live, and the nature of the fertilising element; for"
1228,"we know of no means, analogous to the action of insects and of the wind"
1228,"in the case of plants, by which an occasional cross could be effected"
1228,with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two individuals.
1228,"Of aquatic animals, there are many self-fertilising hermaphrodites;"
1228,but here currents in the water offer an obvious means for an occasional
1228,"cross. And, as in the case of flowers, I have as yet failed, after"
1228,"consultation with one of the highest authorities, namely, Professor"
1228,"Huxley, to discover a single case of an hermaphrodite animal with the"
1228,"organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed within the body, that"
1228,access from without and the occasional influence of a distinct
1228,individual can be shown to be physically impossible. Cirripedes long
1228,appeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under this
1228,"point of view; but I have been enabled, by a fortunate chance, elsewhere"
1228,"to prove that two individuals, though both are self-fertilising"
1228,"hermaphrodites, do sometimes cross."
1228,
1228,"It must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, in the"
1228,"case of both animals and plants, species of the same family and even of"
1228,"the same genus, though agreeing closely with each other in almost their"
1228,"whole organisation, yet are not rarely, some of them hermaphrodites,"
1228,"and some of them unisexual. But if, in fact, all hermaphrodites do"
1228,"occasionally intercross with other individuals, the difference between"
1228,"hermaphrodites and unisexual species, as far as function is concerned,"
1228,becomes very small.
1228,
1228,From these several considerations and from the many special facts which
1228,"I have collected, but which I am not here able to give, I am strongly"
1228,"inclined to suspect that, both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, an"
1228,occasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature. I
1228,"am well aware that there are, on this view, many cases of difficulty,"
1228,"some of which I am trying to investigate. Finally then, we may conclude"
1228,"that in many organic beings, a cross between two individuals is an"
1228,obvious necessity for each birth; in many others it occurs perhaps only
1228,"at long intervals; but in none, as I suspect, can self-fertilisation go"
1228,on for perpetuity.
1228,
1228,CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE TO NATURAL SELECTION.
1228,
1228,This is an extremely intricate subject. A large amount of inheritable
1228,"and diversified variability is favourable, but I believe mere individual"
1228,"differences suffice for the work. A large number of individuals, by"
1228,giving a better chance for the appearance within any given period
1228,"of profitable variations, will compensate for a lesser amount of"
1228,"variability in each individual, and is, I believe, an extremely"
1228,important element of success. Though nature grants vast periods of time
1228,"for the work of natural selection, she does not grant an indefinite"
1228,"period; for as all organic beings are striving, it may be said, to seize"
1228,"on each place in the economy of nature, if any one species does"
1228,not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its
1228,"competitors, it will soon be exterminated."
1228,
1228,"In man's methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite"
1228,"object, and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work. But when many"
1228,"men, without intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard"
1228,"of perfection, and all try to get and breed from the best animals,"
1228,much improvement and modification surely but slowly follow from this
1228,"unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding a large amount of"
1228,crossing with inferior animals. Thus it will be in nature; for within a
1228,"confined area, with some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied"
1228,"as might be, natural selection will always tend to preserve all the"
1228,"individuals varying in the right direction, though in different degrees,"
1228,"so as better to fill up the unoccupied place. But if the area be large,"
1228,its several districts will almost certainly present different conditions
1228,of life; and then if natural selection be modifying and improving a
1228,"species in the several districts, there will be intercrossing with the"
1228,other individuals of the same species on the confines of each. And in
1228,this case the effects of intercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by
1228,natural selection always tending to modify all the individuals in each
1228,district in exactly the same manner to the conditions of each; for in a
1228,"continuous area, the conditions will generally graduate away insensibly"
1228,from one district to another. The intercrossing will most affect those
1228,"animals which unite for each birth, which wander much, and which do"
1228,"not breed at a very quick rate. Hence in animals of this nature, for"
1228,"instance in birds, varieties will generally be confined to separated"
1228,countries; and this I believe to be the case. In hermaphrodite organisms
1228,"which cross only occasionally, and likewise in animals which unite for"
1228,"each birth, but which wander little and which can increase at a very"
1228,"rapid rate, a new and improved variety might be quickly formed on any"
1228,"one spot, and might there maintain itself in a body, so that whatever"
1228,intercrossing took place would be chiefly between the individuals of
1228,the same new variety. A local variety when once thus formed might
1228,"subsequently slowly spread to other districts. On the above principle,"
1228,nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large body of plants of
1228,"the same variety, as the chance of intercrossing with other varieties is"
1228,thus lessened.
1228,
1228,"Even in the case of slow-breeding animals, which unite for each birth,"
1228,we must not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding natural
1228,"selection; for I can bring a considerable catalogue of facts, showing"
1228,"that within the same area, varieties of the same animal can long remain"
1228,"distinct, from haunting different stations, from breeding at slightly"
1228,"different seasons, or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pair"
1228,together.
1228,
1228,Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the
1228,"individuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and"
1228,uniform in character. It will obviously thus act far more efficiently
1228,with those animals which unite for each birth; but I have already
1228,attempted to show that we have reason to believe that occasional
1228,intercrosses take place with all animals and with all plants. Even if
1228,"these take place only at long intervals, I am convinced that the"
1228,young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the
1228,"offspring from long-continued self-fertilisation, that they will have a"
1228,"better chance of surviving and propagating their kind; and thus, in the"
1228,"long run, the influence of intercrosses, even at rare intervals, will be"
1228,"great. If there exist organic beings which never intercross, uniformity"
1228,"of character can be retained amongst them, as long as their conditions"
1228,"of life remain the same, only through the principle of inheritance, and"
1228,through natural selection destroying any which depart from the
1228,proper type; but if their conditions of life change and they undergo
1228,"modification, uniformity of character can be given to their modified"
1228,"offspring, solely by natural selection preserving the same favourable"
1228,variations.
1228,
1228,"Isolation, also, is an important element in the process of natural"
1228,"selection. In a confined or isolated area, if not very large, the"
1228,organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great
1228,degree uniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all the
1228,individuals of a varying species throughout the area in the same
1228,"manner in relation to the same conditions. Intercrosses, also, with the"
1228,"individuals of the same species, which otherwise would have inhabited"
1228,"the surrounding and differently circumstanced districts, will be"
1228,prevented. But isolation probably acts more efficiently in checking the
1228,"immigration of better adapted organisms, after any physical change, such"
1228,"as of climate or elevation of the land, etc.; and thus new places in the"
1228,natural economy of the country are left open for the old inhabitants
1228,"to struggle for, and become adapted to, through modifications in their"
1228,"structure and constitution. Lastly, isolation, by checking immigration"
1228,"and consequently competition, will give time for any new variety to"
1228,be slowly improved; and this may sometimes be of importance in the
1228,"production of new species. If, however, an isolated area be very small,"
1228,"either from being surrounded by barriers, or from having very peculiar"
1228,"physical conditions, the total number of the individuals supported on it"
1228,will necessarily be very small; and fewness of individuals will greatly
1228,"retard the production of new species through natural selection, by"
1228,decreasing the chance of the appearance of favourable variations.
1228,
1228,"If we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at"
1228,"any small isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the total"
1228,"number of the species inhabiting it, will be found to be small, as we"
1228,shall see in our chapter on geographical distribution; yet of these
1228,"species a very large proportion are endemic,--that is, have been"
1228,"produced there, and nowhere else. Hence an oceanic island at first sight"
1228,seems to have been highly favourable for the production of new species.
1228,"But we may thus greatly deceive ourselves, for to ascertain whether a"
1228,"small isolated area, or a large open area like a continent, has been"
1228,"most favourable for the production of new organic forms, we ought to"
1228,make the comparison within equal times; and this we are incapable of
1228,doing.
1228,
1228,Although I do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance
1228,"in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe"
1228,"that largeness of area is of more importance, more especially in the"
1228,"production of species, which will prove capable of enduring for a long"
1228,"period, and of spreading widely. Throughout a great and open area, not"
1228,only will there be a better chance of favourable variations arising from
1228,"the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but"
1228,the conditions of life are infinitely complex from the large number
1228,of already existing species; and if some of these many species
1228,"become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a"
1228,"corresponding degree or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also,"
1228,"as soon as it has been much improved, will be able to spread over the"
1228,"open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many"
1228,"others. Hence more new places will be formed, and the competition to"
1228,"fill them will be more severe, on a large than on a small and"
1228,"isolated area. Moreover, great areas, though now continuous, owing to"
1228,"oscillations of level, will often have recently existed in a broken"
1228,"condition, so that the good effects of isolation will generally, to a"
1228,"certain extent, have concurred. Finally, I conclude that, although small"
1228,isolated areas probably have been in some respects highly favourable for
1228,"the production of new species, yet that the course of modification"
1228,will generally have been more rapid on large areas; and what is more
1228,"important, that the new forms produced on large areas, which already"
1228,"have been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will"
1228,"spread most widely, will give rise to most new varieties and species,"
1228,and will thus play an important part in the changing history of the
1228,organic world.
1228,
1228,"We can, perhaps, on these views, understand some facts which will"
1228,be again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution; for
1228,"instance, that the productions of the smaller continent of Australia"
1228,"have formerly yielded, and apparently are now yielding, before those"
1228,"of the larger Europaeo-Asiatic area. Thus, also, it is that continental"
1228,productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands. On
1228,"a small island, the race for life will have been less severe, and there"
1228,"will have been less modification and less extermination. Hence, perhaps,"
1228,"it comes that the flora of Madeira, according to Oswald Heer, resembles"
1228,"the extinct tertiary flora of Europe. All fresh-water basins, taken"
1228,"together, make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the"
1228,"land; and, consequently, the competition between fresh-water productions"
1228,will have been less severe than elsewhere; new forms will have been
1228,"more slowly formed, and old forms more slowly exterminated. And it is"
1228,"in fresh water that we find seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of"
1228,a once preponderant order: and in fresh water we find some of the most
1228,"anomalous forms now known in the world, as the Ornithorhynchus and"
1228,"Lepidosiren, which, like fossils, connect to a certain extent orders now"
1228,widely separated in the natural scale. These anomalous forms may almost
1228,"be called living fossils; they have endured to the present day, from"
1228,"having inhabited a confined area, and from having thus been exposed to"
1228,less severe competition.
1228,
1228,To sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural
1228,"selection, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits. I"
1228,"conclude, looking to the future, that for terrestrial productions a"
1228,"large continental area, which will probably undergo many oscillations"
1228,"of level, and which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken"
1228,"condition, will be the most favourable for the production of many new"
1228,"forms of life, likely to endure long and to spread widely. For the area"
1228,"will first have existed as a continent, and the inhabitants, at this"
1228,"period numerous in individuals and kinds, will have been subjected"
1228,to very severe competition. When converted by subsidence into large
1228,"separate islands, there will still exist many individuals of the same"
1228,species on each island: intercrossing on the confines of the range of
1228,"each species will thus be checked: after physical changes of any kind,"
1228,"immigration will be prevented, so that new places in the polity of"
1228,each island will have to be filled up by modifications of the old
1228,inhabitants; and time will be allowed for the varieties in each to
1228,"become well modified and perfected. When, by renewed elevation, the"
1228,"islands shall be re-converted into a continental area, there will again"
1228,be severe competition: the most favoured or improved varieties will be
1228,enabled to spread: there will be much extinction of the less improved
1228,"forms, and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants"
1228,of the renewed continent will again be changed; and again there will
1228,be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the
1228,"inhabitants, and thus produce new species."
1228,
1228,"That natural selection will always act with extreme slowness, I fully"
1228,"admit. Its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature,"
1228,which can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country
1228,undergoing modification of some kind. The existence of such places will
1228,"often depend on physical changes, which are generally very slow, and"
1228,on the immigration of better adapted forms having been checked. But the
1228,action of natural selection will probably still oftener depend on some
1228,of the inhabitants becoming slowly modified; the mutual relations of
1228,many of the other inhabitants being thus disturbed. Nothing can be
1228,"effected, unless favourable variations occur, and variation itself is"
1228,apparently always a very slow process. The process will often be greatly
1228,retarded by free intercrossing. Many will exclaim that these several
1228,causes are amply sufficient wholly to stop the action of natural
1228,"selection. I do not believe so. On the other hand, I do believe that"
1228,"natural selection will always act very slowly, often only at long"
1228,"intervals of time, and generally on only a very few of the inhabitants"
1228,"of the same region at the same time. I further believe, that this very"
1228,"slow, intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectly"
1228,well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the
1228,inhabitants of this world have changed.
1228,
1228,"Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much"
1228,"by his powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount"
1228,"of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations"
1228,"between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical"
1228,"conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by"
1228,nature's power of selection.
1228,
1228,EXTINCTION.
1228,
1228,This subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on Geology; but
1228,it must be here alluded to from being intimately connected with natural
1228,selection. Natural selection acts solely through the preservation of
1228,"variations in some way advantageous, which consequently endure. But as"
1228,"from the high geometrical powers of increase of all organic beings, each"
1228,"area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, it follows that as"
1228,"each selected and favoured form increases in number, so will the less"
1228,"favoured forms decrease and become rare. Rarity, as geology tells us, is"
1228,"the precursor to extinction. We can, also, see that any form represented"
1228,"by few individuals will, during fluctuations in the seasons or in the"
1228,"number of its enemies, run a good chance of utter extinction. But we may"
1228,go further than this; for as new forms are continually and slowly being
1228,"produced, unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on"
1228,"perpetually and almost indefinitely increasing, numbers inevitably must"
1228,become extinct. That the number of specific forms has not indefinitely
1228,"increased, geology shows us plainly; and indeed we can see reason why"
1228,"they should not have thus increased, for the number of places in the"
1228,"polity of nature is not indefinitely great,--not that we have any means"
1228,of knowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species.
1228,"Probably no region is as yet fully stocked, for at the Cape of Good"
1228,"Hope, where more species of plants are crowded together than in any"
1228,"other quarter of the world, some foreign plants have become naturalised,"
1228,"without causing, as far as we know, the extinction of any natives."
1228,
1228,"Furthermore, the species which are most numerous in individuals will"
1228,have the best chance of producing within any given period favourable
1228,"variations. We have evidence of this, in the facts given in the second"
1228,"chapter, showing that it is the common species which afford the greatest"
1228,"number of recorded varieties, or incipient species. Hence, rare species"
1228,"will be less quickly modified or improved within any given period, and"
1228,they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modified
1228,descendants of the commoner species.
1228,
1228,"From these several considerations I think it inevitably follows, that as"
1228,"new species in the course of time are formed through natural selection,"
1228,"others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct. The forms which"
1228,stand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and
1228,"improvement, will naturally suffer most. And we have seen in the"
1228,chapter on the Struggle for Existence that it is the most closely-allied
1228,"forms,--varieties of the same species, and species of the same genus"
1228,"or of related genera,--which, from having nearly the same structure,"
1228,"constitution, and habits, generally come into the severest competition"
1228,"with each other. Consequently, each new variety or species, during the"
1228,"progress of its formation, will generally press hardest on its nearest"
1228,"kindred, and tend to exterminate them. We see the same process of"
1228,"extermination amongst our domesticated productions, through the"
1228,selection of improved forms by man. Many curious instances could
1228,"be given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle, sheep, and other"
1228,"animals, and varieties of flowers, take the place of older and inferior"
1228,"kinds. In Yorkshire, it is historically known that the ancient black"
1228,"cattle were displaced by the long-horns, and that these ""were swept away"
1228,"by the short-horns"" (I quote the words of an agricultural writer) ""as if"
1228,"by some murderous pestilence."""
1228,
1228,DIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER.
1228,
1228,"The principle, which I have designated by this term, is of high"
1228,"importance on my theory, and explains, as I believe, several important"
1228,"facts. In the first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though"
1228,having somewhat of the character of species--as is shown by the hopeless
1228,doubts in many cases how to rank them--yet certainly differ from
1228,"each other far less than do good and distinct species. Nevertheless,"
1228,"according to my view, varieties are species in the process of formation,"
1228,"or are, as I have called them, incipient species. How, then, does the"
1228,lesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greater
1228,"difference between species? That this does habitually happen, we must"
1228,infer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting
1228,"well-marked differences; whereas varieties, the supposed prototypes and"
1228,"parents of future well-marked species, present slight and ill-defined"
1228,"differences. Mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one variety"
1228,"to differ in some character from its parents, and the offspring of this"
1228,variety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and
1228,in a greater degree; but this alone would never account for so habitual
1228,and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of the same
1228,species and species of the same genus.
1228,
1228,"As has always been my practice, let us seek light on this head from our"
1228,domestic productions. We shall here find something analogous. A fancier
1228,is struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak; another fancier is
1228,struck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak; and on the acknowledged
1228,"principle that ""fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard,"
1228,"but like extremes,"" they both go on (as has actually occurred with"
1228,tumbler-pigeons) choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer
1228,"beaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks. Again, we may suppose that at"
1228,an early period one man preferred swifter horses; another stronger and
1228,more bulky horses. The early differences would be very slight; in the
1228,"course of time, from the continued selection of swifter horses by some"
1228,"breeders, and of stronger ones by others, the differences would become"
1228,"greater, and would be noted as forming two sub-breeds; finally, after"
1228,"the lapse of centuries, the sub-breeds would become converted into two"
1228,well-established and distinct breeds. As the differences slowly become
1228,"greater, the inferior animals with intermediate characters, being"
1228,"neither very swift nor very strong, will have been neglected, and will"
1228,"have tended to disappear. Here, then, we see in man's productions"
1228,"the action of what may be called the principle of divergence, causing"
1228,"differences, at first barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and"
1228,the breeds to diverge in character both from each other and from their
1228,common parent.
1228,
1228,"But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature?"
1228,"I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple"
1228,circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one
1228,"species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will"
1228,they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in
1228,"the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers."
1228,
1228,We can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits. Take
1228,"the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can be"
1228,supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average. If
1228,"its natural powers of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in"
1228,increasing (the country not undergoing any change in its conditions)
1228,only by its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by
1228,"other animals: some of them, for instance, being enabled to feed on"
1228,"new kinds of prey, either dead or alive; some inhabiting new stations,"
1228,"climbing trees, frequenting water, and some perhaps becoming less"
1228,carnivorous. The more diversified in habits and structure the
1228,"descendants of our carnivorous animal became, the more places they would"
1228,be enabled to occupy. What applies to one animal will apply throughout
1228,"all time to all animals--that is, if they vary--for otherwise natural"
1228,selection can do nothing. So it will be with plants. It has been
1228,"experimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one species"
1228,"of grass, and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of"
1228,"grasses, a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage"
1228,can thus be raised. The same has been found to hold good when first
1228,one variety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on
1228,"equal spaces of ground. Hence, if any one species of grass were to go"
1228,"on varying, and those varieties were continually selected which differed"
1228,from each other in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera
1228,"of grasses differ from each other, a greater number of individual plants"
1228,"of this species of grass, including its modified descendants, would"
1228,succeed in living on the same piece of ground. And we well know that
1228,each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost
1228,"countless seeds; and thus, as it may be said, is striving its utmost to"
1228,"increase its numbers. Consequently, I cannot doubt that in the course"
1228,"of many thousands of generations, the most distinct varieties of any one"
1228,species of grass would always have the best chance of succeeding and
1228,"of increasing in numbers, and thus of supplanting the less distinct"
1228,"varieties; and varieties, when rendered very distinct from each other,"
1228,take the rank of species.
1228,
1228,"The truth of the principle, that the greatest amount of life can be"
1228,"supported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many"
1228,"natural circumstances. In an extremely small area, especially if freely"
1228,"open to immigration, and where the contest between individual and"
1228,"individual must be severe, we always find great diversity in its"
1228,"inhabitants. For instance, I found that a piece of turf, three feet by"
1228,"four in size, which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same"
1228,"conditions, supported twenty species of plants, and these belonged to"
1228,"eighteen genera and to eight orders, which shows how much these plants"
1228,differed from each other. So it is with the plants and insects on small
1228,and uniform islets; and so in small ponds of fresh water. Farmers find
1228,that they can raise most food by a rotation of plants belonging to the
1228,most different orders: nature follows what may be called a simultaneous
1228,rotation. Most of the animals and plants which live close round any
1228,"small piece of ground, could live on it (supposing it not to be in"
1228,"any way peculiar in its nature), and may be said to be striving to the"
1228,"utmost to live there; but, it is seen, that where they come into the"
1228,"closest competition with each other, the advantages of diversification"
1228,"of structure, with the accompanying differences of habit and"
1228,"constitution, determine that the inhabitants, which thus jostle each"
1228,"other most closely, shall, as a general rule, belong to what we call"
1228,different genera and orders.
1228,
1228,The same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through man's
1228,agency in foreign lands. It might have been expected that the plants
1228,which have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally
1228,have been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are commonly looked
1228,"at as specially created and adapted for their own country. It might,"
1228,"also, perhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have"
1228,belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in
1228,their new homes. But the case is very different; and Alph. De Candolle
1228,"has well remarked in his great and admirable work, that floras gain by"
1228,"naturalisation, proportionally with the number of the native genera and"
1228,"species, far more in new genera than in new species. To give a single"
1228,instance: in the last edition of Dr. Asa Gray's 'Manual of the Flora of
1228,"the Northern United States,'  naturalised plants are enumerated, and"
1228,these belong to  genera. We thus see that these naturalised plants
1228,"are of a highly diversified nature. They differ, moreover, to a large"
1228,"extent from the indigenes, for out of the  genera, no less than "
1228,"genera are not there indigenous, and thus a large proportional addition"
1228,is made to the genera of these States.
1228,
1228,By considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggled
1228,"successfully with the indigenes of any country, and have there become"
1228,"naturalised, we can gain some crude idea in what manner some of the"
1228,"natives would have had to be modified, in order to have gained an"
1228,"advantage over the other natives; and we may, I think, at least safely"
1228,"infer that diversification of structure, amounting to new generic"
1228,"differences, would have been profitable to them."
1228,
1228,The advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region
1228,"is, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division of labour in"
1228,the organs of the same individual body--a subject so well elucidated by
1228,Milne Edwards. No physiologist doubts that a stomach by being adapted to
1228,"digest vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws most nutriment from"
1228,"these substances. So in the general economy of any land, the more widely"
1228,and perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different
1228,"habits of life, so will a greater number of individuals be capable of"
1228,"there supporting themselves. A set of animals, with their organisation"
1228,"but little diversified, could hardly compete with a set more perfectly"
1228,"diversified in structure. It may be doubted, for instance, whether"
1228,"the Australian marsupials, which are divided into groups differing but"
1228,"little from each other, and feebly representing, as Mr. Waterhouse and"
1228,"others have remarked, our carnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals,"
1228,could successfully compete with these well-pronounced orders. In the
1228,"Australian mammals, we see the process of diversification in an early"
1228,"and incomplete stage of development. After the foregoing discussion,"
1228,"which ought to have been much amplified, we may, I think, assume that"
1228,the modified descendants of any one species will succeed by so much
1228,"the better as they become more diversified in structure, and are thus"
1228,enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings. Now let us see
1228,how this principle of great benefit being derived from divergence of
1228,"character, combined with the principles of natural selection and of"
1228,"extinction, will tend to act."
1228,
1228,The accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather
1228,perplexing subject. Let A to L represent the species of a genus large
1228,in its own country; these species are supposed to resemble each other
1228,"in unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature, and as is"
1228,represented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances.
1228,"I have said a large genus, because we have seen in the second chapter,"
1228,that on an average more of the species of large genera vary than of
1228,small genera; and the varying species of the large genera present a
1228,"greater number of varieties. We have, also, seen that the species, which"
1228,"are the commonest and the most widely-diffused, vary more than rare"
1228,"species with restricted ranges. Let (A) be a common, widely-diffused,"
1228,"and varying species, belonging to a genus large in its own country. The"
1228,little fan of diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from
1228,"(A), may represent its varying offspring. The variations are supposed"
1228,"to be extremely slight, but of the most diversified nature; they are not"
1228,"supposed all to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals of"
1228,time; nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods. Only
1228,those variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or
1228,naturally selected. And here the importance of the principle of benefit
1228,being derived from divergence of character comes in; for this
1228,will generally lead to the most different or divergent variations
1228,(represented by the outer dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated
1228,by natural selection. When a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal
1228,"lines, and is there marked by a small numbered letter, a sufficient"
1228,amount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated to have formed
1228,"a fairly well-marked variety, such as would be thought worthy of record"
1228,in a systematic work.
1228,
1228,"The intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may represent"
1228,each a thousand generations; but it would have been better if each had
1228,"represented ten thousand generations. After a thousand generations,"
1228,species (A) is supposed to have produced two fairly well-marked
1228,"varieties, namely a and m. These two varieties will generally continue"
1228,"to be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable,"
1228,"and the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary, consequently"
1228,"they will tend to vary, and generally to vary in nearly the same manner"
1228,"as their parents varied. Moreover, these two varieties, being only"
1228,"slightly modified forms, will tend to inherit those advantages which"
1228,made their common parent (A) more numerous than most of the other
1228,inhabitants of the same country; they will likewise partake of those
1228,more general advantages which made the genus to which the parent-species
1228,"belonged, a large genus in its own country. And these circumstances we"
1228,know to be favourable to the production of new varieties.
1228,
1228,"If, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of"
1228,their variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand
1228,"generations. And after this interval, variety a is supposed in the"
1228,"diagram to have produced variety a, which will, owing to the principle"
1228,"of divergence, differ more from (A) than did variety a. Variety m is"
1228,"supposed to have produced two varieties, namely m and s, differing"
1228,"from each other, and more considerably from their common parent (A). We"
1228,may continue the process by similar steps for any length of time; some
1228,"of the varieties, after each thousand generations, producing only"
1228,"a single variety, but in a more and more modified condition, some"
1228,"producing two or three varieties, and some failing to produce any. Thus"
1228,"the varieties or modified descendants, proceeding from the common"
1228,"parent (A), will generally go on increasing in number and diverging"
1228,in character. In the diagram the process is represented up to the
1228,"ten-thousandth generation, and under a condensed and simplified form up"
1228,to the fourteen-thousandth generation.
1228,
1228,But I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes
1228,"on so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself"
1228,made somewhat irregular. I am far from thinking that the most divergent
1228,varieties will invariably prevail and multiply: a medium form may
1228,"often long endure, and may or may not produce more than one modified"
1228,descendant; for natural selection will always act according to the
1228,nature of the places which are either unoccupied or not perfectly
1228,occupied by other beings; and this will depend on infinitely complex
1228,"relations. But as a general rule, the more diversified in structure the"
1228,"descendants from any one species can be rendered, the more places they"
1228,"will be enabled to seize on, and the more their modified progeny will"
1228,be increased. In our diagram the line of succession is broken at regular
1228,intervals by small numbered letters marking the successive forms which
1228,have become sufficiently distinct to be recorded as varieties. But
1228,"these breaks are imaginary, and might have been inserted anywhere, after"
1228,intervals long enough to have allowed the accumulation of a considerable
1228,amount of divergent variation.
1228,
1228,As all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused
1228,"species, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the"
1228,"same advantages which made their parent successful in life, they will"
1228,generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character:
1228,this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches
1228,proceeding from (A). The modified offspring from the later and more
1228,"highly improved branches in the lines of descent, will, it is probable,"
1228,"often take the place of, and so destroy, the earlier and less improved"
1228,branches: this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower
1228,branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines. In some cases I do
1228,not doubt that the process of modification will be confined to a
1228,"single line of descent, and the number of the descendants will not be"
1228,increased; although the amount of divergent modification may have been
1228,increased in the successive generations. This case would be represented
1228,"in the diagram, if all the lines proceeding from (A) were removed,"
1228,"excepting that from a to a. In the same way, for instance, the"
1228,English race-horse and English pointer have apparently both gone on
1228,"slowly diverging in character from their original stocks, without either"
1228,having given off any fresh branches or races.
1228,
1228,"After ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced"
1228,"three forms, a, f, and m, which, from having diverged in character"
1228,"during the successive generations, will have come to differ largely, but"
1228,"perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common parent. If we"
1228,suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram
1228,"to be excessively small, these three forms may still be only well-marked"
1228,varieties; or they may have arrived at the doubtful category of
1228,sub-species; but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of
1228,"modification to be more numerous or greater in amount, to convert these"
1228,three forms into well-defined species: thus the diagram illustrates
1228,the steps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties
1228,are increased into the larger differences distinguishing species. By
1228,continuing the same process for a greater number of generations (as
1228,"shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner), we get eight"
1228,"species, marked by the letters between a and m, all descended from"
1228,"(A). Thus, as I believe, species are multiplied and genera are formed."
1228,
1228,In a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary.
1228,"In the diagram I have assumed that a second species (I) has produced, by"
1228,"analogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either two well-marked"
1228,"varieties (w and z) or two species, according to the amount of"
1228,change supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines. After
1228,"fourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by the letters"
1228,"n to z, are supposed to have been produced. In each genus, the"
1228,"species, which are already extremely different in character, will"
1228,generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants;
1228,for these will have the best chance of filling new and widely different
1228,places in the polity of nature: hence in the diagram I have chosen the
1228,"extreme species (A), and the nearly extreme species (I), as those which"
1228,"have largely varied, and have given rise to new varieties and species."
1228,The other nine species (marked by capital letters) of our original
1228,"genus, may for a long period continue transmitting unaltered"
1228,descendants; and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted lines not
1228,prolonged far upwards from want of space.
1228,
1228,"But during the process of modification, represented in the diagram,"
1228,"another of our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played"
1228,an important part. As in each fully stocked country natural selection
1228,necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the
1228,"struggle for life over other forms, there will be a constant tendency in"
1228,the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate
1228,in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original parent.
1228,For it should be remembered that the competition will generally be most
1228,severe between those forms which are most nearly related to each other
1228,"in habits, constitution, and structure. Hence all the intermediate forms"
1228,"between the earlier and later states, that is between the less and more"
1228,"improved state of a species, as well as the original parent-species"
1228,"itself, will generally tend to become extinct. So it probably will be"
1228,"with many whole collateral lines of descent, which will be conquered by"
1228,"later and improved lines of descent. If, however, the modified offspring"
1228,"of a species get into some distinct country, or become quickly adapted"
1228,"to some quite new station, in which child and parent do not come into"
1228,"competition, both may continue to exist."
1228,
1228,If then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of
1228,"modification, species (A) and all the earlier varieties will have become"
1228,"extinct, having been replaced by eight new species (a to m); and (I)"
1228,will have been replaced by six (n to z) new species.
1228,
1228,But we may go further than this. The original species of our genus were
1228,"supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally"
1228,"the case in nature; species (A) being more nearly related to B, C, and"
1228,"D, than to the other species; and species (I) more to G, H, K, L, than"
1228,"to the others. These two species (A) and (I), were also supposed to be"
1228,"very common and widely diffused species, so that they must originally"
1228,have had some advantage over most of the other species of the
1228,"genus. Their modified descendants, fourteen in number at the"
1228,"fourteen-thousandth generation, will probably have inherited some of"
1228,the same advantages: they have also been modified and improved in
1228,"a diversified manner at each stage of descent, so as to have become"
1228,adapted to many related places in the natural economy of their country.
1228,"It seems, therefore, to me extremely probable that they will have taken"
1228,"the places of, and thus exterminated, not only their parents (A) and"
1228,"(I), but likewise some of the original species which were most nearly"
1228,related to their parents. Hence very few of the original species will
1228,have transmitted offspring to the fourteen-thousandth generation. We may
1228,"suppose that only one (F), of the two species which were least closely"
1228,"related to the other nine original species, has transmitted descendants"
1228,to this late stage of descent.
1228,
1228,The new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven
1228,"species, will now be fifteen in number. Owing to the divergent tendency"
1228,"of natural selection, the extreme amount of difference in character"
1228,between species a and z will be much greater than that between
1228,"the most different of the original eleven species. The new species,"
1228,"moreover, will be allied to each other in a widely different manner. Of"
1228,"the eight descendants from (A) the three marked a, q, p, will be"
1228,nearly related from having recently branched off from a; b and
1228,"f, from having diverged at an earlier period from a, will be in some"
1228,"degree distinct from the three first-named species; and lastly, o,"
1228,"e, and m, will be nearly related one to the other, but from having"
1228,"diverged at the first commencement of the process of modification, will"
1228,"be widely different from the other five species, and may constitute a"
1228,sub-genus or even a distinct genus.
1228,
1228,The six descendants from (I) will form two sub-genera or even genera.
1228,"But as the original species (I) differed largely from (A), standing"
1228,"nearly at the extreme points of the original genus, the six descendants"
1228,"from (I) will, owing to inheritance, differ considerably from the eight"
1228,"descendants from (A); the two groups, moreover, are supposed to have"
1228,"gone on diverging in different directions. The intermediate species,"
1228,"also (and this is a very important consideration), which connected the"
1228,"original species (A) and (I), have all become, excepting (F), extinct,"
1228,and have left no descendants. Hence the six new species descended from
1228,"(I), and the eight descended from (A), will have to be ranked as very"
1228,"distinct genera, or even as distinct sub-families."
1228,
1228,"Thus it is, as I believe, that two or more genera are produced by"
1228,"descent, with modification, from two or more species of the same genus."
1228,And the two or more parent-species are supposed to have descended from
1228,"some one species of an earlier genus. In our diagram, this is indicated"
1228,"by the broken lines, beneath the capital letters, converging in"
1228,sub-branches downwards towards a single point; this point representing a
1228,"single species, the supposed single parent of our several new sub-genera"
1228,and genera.
1228,
1228,It is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new
1228,"species F, which is supposed not to have diverged much in character,"
1228,"but to have retained the form of (F), either unaltered or altered only"
1228,"in a slight degree. In this case, its affinities to the other fourteen"
1228,new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature. Having descended
1228,"from a form which stood between the two parent-species (A) and (I),"
1228,"now supposed to be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree"
1228,intermediate in character between the two groups descended from these
1228,species. But as these two groups have gone on diverging in character
1228,"from the type of their parents, the new species (F) will not be"
1228,"directly intermediate between them, but rather between types of the two"
1228,groups; and every naturalist will be able to bring some such case before
1228,his mind.
1228,
1228,"In the diagram, each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to"
1228,"represent a thousand generations, but each may represent a million or"
1228,"hundred million generations, and likewise a section of the successive"
1228,"strata of the earth's crust including extinct remains. We shall, when we"
1228,"come to our chapter on Geology, have to refer again to this subject,"
1228,and I think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the
1228,"affinities of extinct beings, which, though generally belonging to the"
1228,"same orders, or families, or genera, with those now living, yet are"
1228,"often, in some degree, intermediate in character between existing"
1228,"groups; and we can understand this fact, for the extinct species lived"
1228,at very ancient epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged
1228,less.
1228,
1228,"I see no reason to limit the process of modification, as now explained,"
1228,"to the formation of genera alone. If, in our diagram, we suppose the"
1228,amount of change represented by each successive group of diverging
1228,"dotted lines to be very great, the forms marked a to p, those marked"
1228,"b and f, and those marked o to m, will form three very distinct"
1228,genera. We shall also have two very distinct genera descended from
1228,"(I) and as these latter two genera, both from continued divergence of"
1228,"character and from inheritance from a different parent, will differ"
1228,"widely from the three genera descended from (A), the two little groups"
1228,"of genera will form two distinct families, or even orders, according to"
1228,the amount of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the
1228,"diagram. And the two new families, or orders, will have descended from"
1228,two species of the original genus; and these two species are supposed
1228,to have descended from one species of a still more ancient and unknown
1228,genus.
1228,
1228,We have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger genera
1228,"which oftenest present varieties or incipient species. This, indeed,"
1228,might have been expected; for as natural selection acts through one form
1228,"having some advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence,"
1228,it will chiefly act on those which already have some advantage; and
1228,the largeness of any group shows that its species have inherited from
1228,"a common ancestor some advantage in common. Hence, the struggle for the"
1228,"production of new and modified descendants, will mainly lie between the"
1228,"larger groups, which are all trying to increase in number. One large"
1228,"group will slowly conquer another large group, reduce its numbers, and"
1228,thus lessen its chance of further variation and improvement. Within the
1228,"same large group, the later and more highly perfected sub-groups, from"
1228,"branching out and seizing on many new places in the polity of Nature,"
1228,will constantly tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and less
1228,improved sub-groups. Small and broken groups and sub-groups will finally
1228,"tend to disappear. Looking to the future, we can predict that the groups"
1228,"of organic beings which are now large and triumphant, and which are"
1228,"least broken up, that is, which as yet have suffered least extinction,"
1228,will for a long period continue to increase. But which groups will
1228,"ultimately prevail, no man can predict; for we well know that many"
1228,"groups, formerly most extensively developed, have now become extinct."
1228,"Looking still more remotely to the future, we may predict that, owing to"
1228,"the continued and steady increase of the larger groups, a multitude"
1228,"of smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and leave no modified"
1228,descendants; and consequently that of the species living at any one
1228,"period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity. I"
1228,"shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on Classification,"
1228,but I may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancient
1228,"species having transmitted descendants, and on the view of all the"
1228,"descendants of the same species making a class, we can understand how"
1228,it is that there exist but very few classes in each main division of
1228,the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Although extremely few of the most
1228,"ancient species may now have living and modified descendants, yet at the"
1228,"most remote geological period, the earth may have been as well peopled"
1228,"with many species of many genera, families, orders, and classes, as at"
1228,the present day.
1228,
1228,SUMMARY OF CHAPTER.
1228,
1228,"If during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of life,"
1228,"organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their organisation,"
1228,"and I think this cannot be disputed; if there be, owing to the high"
1228,"geometrical powers of increase of each species, at some age, season, or"
1228,"year, a severe struggle for life, and this certainly cannot be disputed;"
1228,"then, considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all"
1228,"organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence,"
1228,"causing an infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and habits, to"
1228,"be advantageous to them, I think it would be a most extraordinary fact"
1228,"if no variation ever had occurred useful to each being's own welfare, in"
1228,the same way as so many variations have occurred useful to man. But if
1228,"variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals"
1228,thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the
1228,struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they
1228,will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised. This principle
1228,"of preservation, I have called, for the sake of brevity, Natural"
1228,"Selection. Natural selection, on the principle of qualities being"
1228,"inherited at corresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young, as"
1228,"easily as the adult. Amongst many animals, sexual selection will give"
1228,"its aid to ordinary selection, by assuring to the most vigorous and best"
1228,adapted males the greatest number of offspring. Sexual selection will
1228,"also give characters useful to the males alone, in their struggles with"
1228,other males.
1228,
1228,"Whether natural selection has really thus acted in nature, in modifying"
1228,and adapting the various forms of life to their several conditions
1228,"and stations, must be judged of by the general tenour and balance of"
1228,evidence given in the following chapters. But we already see how it
1228,entails extinction; and how largely extinction has acted in the world's
1228,"history, geology plainly declares. Natural selection, also, leads to"
1228,divergence of character; for more living beings can be supported on the
1228,"same area the more they diverge in structure, habits, and constitution,"
1228,of which we see proof by looking at the inhabitants of any small spot
1228,or at naturalised productions. Therefore during the modification of the
1228,"descendants of any one species, and during the incessant struggle of all"
1228,"species to increase in numbers, the more diversified these descendants"
1228,"become, the better will be their chance of succeeding in the battle of"
1228,life. Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same
1228,"species, will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the"
1228,"greater differences between species of the same genus, or even of"
1228,distinct genera.
1228,
1228,"We have seen that it is the common, the widely-diffused, and"
1228,"widely-ranging species, belonging to the larger genera, which vary"
1228,most; and these will tend to transmit to their modified offspring
1228,that superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries.
1228,"Natural selection, as has just been remarked, leads to divergence of"
1228,character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate
1228,"forms of life. On these principles, I believe, the nature of the"
1228,affinities of all organic beings may be explained. It is a truly
1228,wonderful fact--the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from
1228,familiarity--that all animals and all plants throughout all time and
1228,"space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group,"
1228,"in the manner which we everywhere behold--namely, varieties of the same"
1228,"species most closely related together, species of the same genus less"
1228,"closely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera,"
1228,"species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera"
1228,"related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders,"
1228,"sub-classes, and classes. The several subordinate groups in any class"
1228,"cannot be ranked in a single file, but seem rather to be clustered"
1228,"round points, and these round other points, and so on in almost endless"
1228,"cycles. On the view that each species has been independently created, I"
1228,can see no explanation of this great fact in the classification of all
1228,"organic beings; but, to the best of my judgment, it is explained through"
1228,"inheritance and the complex action of natural selection, entailing"
1228,"extinction and divergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in"
1228,the diagram.
1228,
1228,The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been
1228,represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the
1228,truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and
1228,those produced during each former year may represent the long succession
1228,of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs
1228,"have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the"
1228,"surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups"
1228,of species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle
1228,"for life. The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser"
1228,"and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small,"
1228,budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present buds by
1228,ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct
1228,and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the many twigs
1228,"which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three, now"
1228,"grown into great branches, yet survive and bear all the other branches;"
1228,"so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods,"
1228,very few now have living and modified descendants. From the first growth
1228,"of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off; and"
1228,"these lost branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders,"
1228,"families, and genera which have now no living representatives, and which"
1228,are known to us only from having been found in a fossil state. As we
1228,here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low
1228,"down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured and is"
1228,"still alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the"
1228,"Ornithorhynchus or Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by"
1228,"its affinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently been"
1228,saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station. As
1228,"buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch"
1228,"out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I"
1228,"believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its"
1228,"dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface"
1228,with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.

1228,
1228,. LAWS OF VARIATION.
1228,
1228,"Effects of external conditions. Use and disuse, combined with natural"
1228,selection; organs of flight and of vision. Acclimatisation. Correlation
1228,of growth. Compensation and economy of growth. False correlations.
1228,"Multiple, rudimentary, and lowly organised structures variable. Parts"
1228,developed in an unusual manner are highly variable: specific characters
1228,more variable than generic: secondary sexual characters variable.
1228,Species of the same genus vary in an analogous manner. Reversions to
1228,long lost characters. Summary.
1228,
1228,I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations--so common and
1228,"multiform in organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser degree"
1228,"in those in a state of nature--had been due to chance. This, of course,"
1228,"is a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly"
1228,our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation. Some authors
1228,believe it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to
1228,"produce individual differences, or very slight deviations of structure,"
1228,"as to make the child like its parents. But the much greater variability,"
1228,"as well as the greater frequency of monstrosities, under domestication"
1228,"or cultivation, than under nature, leads me to believe that deviations"
1228,of structure are in some way due to the nature of the conditions of
1228,"life, to which the parents and their more remote ancestors have been"
1228,exposed during several generations. I have remarked in the first
1228,chapter--but a long catalogue of facts which cannot be here given would
1228,be necessary to show the truth of the remark--that the reproductive
1228,system is eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life;
1228,"and to this system being functionally disturbed in the parents, I"
1228,chiefly attribute the varying or plastic condition of the offspring. The
1228,male and female sexual elements seem to be affected before that union
1228,"takes place which is to form a new being. In the case of ""sporting"""
1228,"plants, the bud, which in its earliest condition does not apparently"
1228,"differ essentially from an ovule, is alone affected. But why, because"
1228,"the reproductive system is disturbed, this or that part should vary more"
1228,"or less, we are profoundly ignorant. Nevertheless, we can here and there"
1228,"dimly catch a faint ray of light, and we may feel sure that there must"
1228,"be some cause for each deviation of structure, however slight."
1228,
1228,"How much direct effect difference of climate, food, etc., produces on"
1228,"any being is extremely doubtful. My impression is, that the effect is"
1228,"extremely small in the case of animals, but perhaps rather more in that"
1228,"of plants. We may, at least, safely conclude that such influences cannot"
1228,have produced the many striking and complex co-adaptations of structure
1228,"between one organic being and another, which we see everywhere"
1228,"throughout nature. Some little influence may be attributed to climate,"
1228,"food, etc.: thus, E. Forbes speaks confidently that shells at their"
1228,"southern limit, and when living in shallow water, are more brightly"
1228,coloured than those of the same species further north or from greater
1228,depths. Gould believes that birds of the same species are more brightly
1228,"coloured under a clear atmosphere, than when living on islands or near"
1228,"the coast. So with insects, Wollaston is convinced that residence near"
1228,the sea affects their colours. Moquin-Tandon gives a list of plants
1228,which when growing near the sea-shore have their leaves in some degree
1228,"fleshy, though not elsewhere fleshy. Several other such cases could be"
1228,given.
1228,
1228,"The fact of varieties of one species, when they range into the zone of"
1228,"habitation of other species, often acquiring in a very slight degree"
1228,"some of the characters of such species, accords with our view that"
1228,species of all kinds are only well-marked and permanent varieties. Thus
1228,the species of shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seas
1228,are generally brighter-coloured than those confined to cold and deeper
1228,"seas. The birds which are confined to continents are, according to"
1228,"Mr. Gould, brighter-coloured than those of islands. The insect-species"
1228,"confined to sea-coasts, as every collector knows, are often brassy or"
1228,lurid. Plants which live exclusively on the sea-side are very apt to
1228,"have fleshy leaves. He who believes in the creation of each species,"
1228,"will have to say that this shell, for instance, was created with bright"
1228,colours for a warm sea; but that this other shell became bright-coloured
1228,by variation when it ranged into warmer or shallower waters.
1228,
1228,"When a variation is of the slightest use to a being, we cannot tell how"
1228,"much of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection,"
1228,"and how much to the conditions of life. Thus, it is well known to"
1228,furriers that animals of the same species have thicker and better fur
1228,the more severe the climate is under which they have lived; but who
1228,can tell how much of this difference may be due to the warmest-clad
1228,"individuals having been favoured and preserved during many generations,"
1228,and how much to the direct action of the severe climate? for it would
1228,appear that climate has some direct action on the hair of our domestic
1228,quadrupeds.
1228,
1228,Instances could be given of the same variety being produced under
1228,"conditions of life as different as can well be conceived; and, on the"
1228,"other hand, of different varieties being produced from the same species"
1228,under the same conditions. Such facts show how indirectly the conditions
1228,"of life must act. Again, innumerable instances are known to every"
1228,"naturalist of species keeping true, or not varying at all, although"
1228,living under the most opposite climates. Such considerations as these
1228,incline me to lay very little weight on the direct action of the
1228,"conditions of life. Indirectly, as already remarked, they seem to play"
1228,"an important part in affecting the reproductive system, and in thus"
1228,inducing variability; and natural selection will then accumulate
1228,"all profitable variations, however slight, until they become plainly"
1228,developed and appreciable by us.
1228,
1228,EFFECTS OF USE AND DISUSE.
1228,
1228,"From the facts alluded to in the first chapter, I think there can be"
1228,little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges
1228,"certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications"
1228,"are inherited. Under free nature, we can have no standard of comparison,"
1228,"by which to judge of the effects of long-continued use or disuse, for we"
1228,know not the parent-forms; but many animals have structures which can
1228,"be explained by the effects of disuse. As Professor Owen has remarked,"
1228,there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly; yet
1228,there are several in this state. The logger-headed duck of South America
1228,"can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its wings in"
1228,nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck. As the larger
1228,"ground-feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, I"
1228,"believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now"
1228,"inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by"
1228,"no beast of prey, has been caused by disuse. The ostrich indeed inhabits"
1228,continents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by
1228,"flight, but by kicking it can defend itself from enemies, as well as any"
1228,of the smaller quadrupeds. We may imagine that the early progenitor
1228,"of the ostrich had habits like those of a bustard, and that as natural"
1228,selection increased in successive generations the size and weight of
1228,"its body, its legs were used more, and its wings less, until they became"
1228,incapable of flight.
1228,
1228,Kirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the anterior
1228,"tarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are very often broken"
1228,"off; he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and not one"
1228,had even a relic left. In the Onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually
1228,"lost, that the insect has been described as not having them. In some"
1228,"other genera they are present, but in a rudimentary condition. In the"
1228,"Ateuchus or sacred beetle of the Egyptians, they are totally deficient."
1228,There is not sufficient evidence to induce us to believe that
1228,mutilations are ever inherited; and I should prefer explaining the
1228,"entire absence of the anterior tarsi in Ateuchus, and their rudimentary"
1228,"condition in some other genera, by the long-continued effects of disuse"
1228,in their progenitors; for as the tarsi are almost always lost in many
1228,"dung-feeding beetles, they must be lost early in life, and therefore"
1228,cannot be much used by these insects.
1228,
1228,In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of
1228,"structure which are wholly, or mainly, due to natural selection. Mr."
1228,"Wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that  beetles, out of"
1228,"the  species inhabiting Madeira, are so far deficient in wings that"
1228,"they cannot fly; and that of the twenty-nine endemic genera, no less"
1228,than twenty-three genera have all their species in this condition!
1228,"Several facts, namely, that beetles in many parts of the world are very"
1228,"frequently blown to sea and perish; that the beetles in Madeira, as"
1228,"observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much concealed, until the wind lulls and"
1228,the sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger on
1228,the exposed Dezertas than in Madeira itself; and especially the
1228,"extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston, of the"
1228,"almost entire absence of certain large groups of beetles, elsewhere"
1228,"excessively numerous, and which groups have habits of life almost"
1228,necessitating frequent flight;--these several considerations have made
1228,me believe that the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles is
1228,"mainly due to the action of natural selection, but combined probably"
1228,with disuse. For during thousands of successive generations each
1228,"individual beetle which flew least, either from its wings having been"
1228,"ever so little less perfectly developed or from indolent habit, will"
1228,have had the best chance of surviving from not being blown out to sea;
1228,"and, on the other hand, those beetles which most readily took to flight"
1228,will oftenest have been blown to sea and thus have been destroyed.
1228,
1228,"The insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as the"
1228,"flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use their"
1228,"wings to gain their subsistence, have, as Mr. Wollaston suspects, their"
1228,"wings not at all reduced, but even enlarged. This is quite compatible"
1228,with the action of natural selection. For when a new insect first
1228,"arrived on the island, the tendency of natural selection to enlarge"
1228,"or to reduce the wings, would depend on whether a greater number of"
1228,"individuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds, or"
1228,by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying. As with mariners
1228,"shipwrecked near a coast, it would have been better for the good"
1228,"swimmers if they had been able to swim still further, whereas it would"
1228,have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim
1228,at all and had stuck to the wreck.
1228,
1228,"The eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size,"
1228,and in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur. This state of
1228,"the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided"
1228,"perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the"
1228,"tuco-tuco, or Ctenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than the"
1228,"mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that"
1228,they were frequently blind; one which I kept alive was certainly in
1228,"this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been"
1228,inflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of
1228,"the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not"
1228,"indispensable to animals with subterranean habits, a reduction in their"
1228,"size with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them,"
1228,"might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would"
1228,constantly aid the effects of disuse.
1228,
1228,"It is well known that several animals, belonging to the most different"
1228,"classes, which inhabit the caves of Styria and of Kentucky, are blind."
1228,"In some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye"
1228,"is gone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope"
1228,with its glasses has been lost. As it is difficult to imagine that
1228,"eyes, though useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in"
1228,"darkness, I attribute their loss wholly to disuse. In one of the"
1228,"blind animals, namely, the cave-rat, the eyes are of immense size; and"
1228,"Professor Silliman thought that it regained, after living some days in"
1228,"the light, some slight power of vision. In the same manner as in Madeira"
1228,"the wings of some of the insects have been enlarged, and the wings of"
1228,"others have been reduced by natural selection aided by use and disuse,"
1228,so in the case of the cave-rat natural selection seems to have struggled
1228,with the loss of light and to have increased the size of the eyes;
1228,"whereas with all the other inhabitants of the caves, disuse by itself"
1228,seems to have done its work.
1228,
1228,It is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep
1228,limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that on the
1228,common view of the blind animals having been separately created for the
1228,"American and European caverns, close similarity in their organisation"
1228,"and affinities might have been expected; but, as Schiodte and others"
1228,"have remarked, this is not the case, and the cave-insects of the two"
1228,continents are not more closely allied than might have been anticipated
1228,from the general resemblance of the other inhabitants of North America
1228,"and Europe. On my view we must suppose that American animals, having"
1228,"ordinary powers of vision, slowly migrated by successive generations"
1228,from the outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky
1228,"caves, as did European animals into the caves of Europe. We have some"
1228,"evidence of this gradation of habit; for, as Schiodte remarks, ""animals"
1228,"not far remote from ordinary forms, prepare the transition from light to"
1228,"darkness. Next follow those that are constructed for twilight; and, last"
1228,"of all, those destined for total darkness."" By the time that an animal"
1228,"had reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse"
1228,"will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and"
1228,"natural selection will often have effected other changes, such as an"
1228,"increase in the length of the antennae or palpi, as a compensation for"
1228,"blindness. Notwithstanding such modifications, we might expect still to"
1228,"see in the cave-animals of America, affinities to the other inhabitants"
1228,"of that continent, and in those of Europe, to the inhabitants of the"
1228,European continent. And this is the case with some of the American
1228,"cave-animals, as I hear from Professor Dana; and some of the European"
1228,cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding
1228,country. It would be most difficult to give any rational explanation of
1228,the affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other inhabitants of the
1228,two continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation. That
1228,several of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New Worlds should
1228,"be closely related, we might expect from the well-known relationship of"
1228,most of their other productions. Far from feeling any surprise that some
1228,"of the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked"
1228,"in regard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with"
1228,"the blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only"
1228,"surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved,"
1228,owing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these
1228,dark abodes will probably have been exposed.
1228,
1228,ACCLIMATISATION.
1228,
1228,"Habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering, in the"
1228,"amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate, in the time of sleep,"
1228,"etc., and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation. As it is"
1228,extremely common for species of the same genus to inhabit very hot and
1228,"very cold countries, and as I believe that all the species of the same"
1228,"genus have descended from a single parent, if this view be correct,"
1228,acclimatisation must be readily effected during long-continued descent.
1228,It is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own
1228,home: species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot
1228,"endure a tropical climate, or conversely. So again, many succulent"
1228,plants cannot endure a damp climate. But the degree of adaptation of
1228,species to the climates under which they live is often overrated. We
1228,may infer this from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an
1228,"imported plant will endure our climate, and from the number of plants"
1228,and animals brought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health.
1228,We have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are limited
1228,in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite as much
1228,"as, or more than, by adaptation to particular climates. But whether or"
1228,"not the adaptation be generally very close, we have evidence, in"
1228,"the case of some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain"
1228,"extent, naturally habituated to different temperatures, or becoming"
1228,"acclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed"
1228,collected by Dr. Hooker from trees growing at different heights on the
1228,"Himalaya, were found in this country to possess different constitutional"
1228,powers of resisting cold. Mr. Thwaites informs me that he has observed
1228,"similar facts in Ceylon, and analogous observations have been made by"
1228,Mr. H. C. Watson on European species of plants brought from the Azores
1228,"to England. In regard to animals, several authentic cases could be given"
1228,of species within historical times having largely extended their
1228,"range from warmer to cooler latitudes, and conversely; but we do not"
1228,positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native
1228,"climate, but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor"
1228,do we know that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new
1228,homes.
1228,
1228,As I believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen by
1228,uncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily under
1228,"confinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable"
1228,"of far-extended transportation, I think the common and extraordinary"
1228,capacity in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most
1228,different climates but of being perfectly fertile (a far severer test)
1228,"under them, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other"
1228,"animals, now in a state of nature, could easily be brought to bear"
1228,"widely different climates. We must not, however, push the foregoing"
1228,"argument too far, on account of the probable origin of some of our"
1228,"domestic animals from several wild stocks: the blood, for instance, of"
1228,a tropical and arctic wolf or wild dog may perhaps be mingled in our
1228,domestic breeds. The rat and mouse cannot be considered as domestic
1228,"animals, but they have been transported by man to many parts of the"
1228,"world, and now have a far wider range than any other rodent, living free"
1228,under the cold climate of Faroe in the north and of the Falklands in the
1228,"south, and on many islands in the torrid zones. Hence I am inclined to"
1228,look at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily grafted
1228,"on an innate wide flexibility of constitution, which is common to most"
1228,"animals. On this view, the capacity of enduring the most different"
1228,"climates by man himself and by his domestic animals, and such facts"
1228,as that former species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capable
1228,"of enduring a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now all"
1228,"tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at"
1228,"as anomalies, but merely as examples of a very common flexibility of"
1228,"constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances, into play."
1228,
1228,How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is
1228,"due to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties"
1228,"having different innate constitutions, and how much to both means"
1228,"combined, is a very obscure question. That habit or custom has some"
1228,"influence I must believe, both from analogy, and from the incessant"
1228,"advice given in agricultural works, even in the ancient Encyclopaedias"
1228,"of China, to be very cautious in transposing animals from one district"
1228,to another; for it is not likely that man should have succeeded in
1228,selecting so many breeds and sub-breeds with constitutions specially
1228,"fitted for their own districts: the result must, I think, be due to"
1228,"habit. On the other hand, I can see no reason to doubt that natural"
1228,selection will continually tend to preserve those individuals which
1228,are born with constitutions best adapted to their native countries. In
1228,"treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants, certain varieties are"
1228,said to withstand certain climates better than others: this is very
1228,"strikingly shown in works on fruit trees published in the United States,"
1228,"in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the northern,"
1228,and others for the southern States; and as most of these varieties are
1228,"of recent origin, they cannot owe their constitutional differences to"
1228,"habit. The case of the Jerusalem artichoke, which is never propagated"
1228,"by seed, and of which consequently new varieties have not been produced,"
1228,has even been advanced--for it is now as tender as ever it was--as
1228,"proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected! The case, also, of the"
1228,"kidney-bean has been often cited for a similar purpose, and with"
1228,"much greater weight; but until some one will sow, during a score of"
1228,"generations, his kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are"
1228,"destroyed by frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with"
1228,"care to prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these"
1228,"seedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to"
1228,have been even tried. Nor let it be supposed that no differences in the
1228,"constitution of seedling kidney-beans ever appear, for an account has"
1228,been published how much more hardy some seedlings appeared to be than
1228,others.
1228,
1228,"On the whole, I think we may conclude that habit, use, and disuse, have,"
1228,"in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the"
1228,"constitution, and of the structure of various organs; but that the"
1228,"effects of use and disuse have often been largely combined with, and"
1228,"sometimes overmastered by, the natural selection of innate differences."
1228,
1228,CORRELATION OF GROWTH.
1228,
1228,I mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied
1228,"together during its growth and development, that when slight variations"
1228,"in any one part occur, and are accumulated through natural selection,"
1228,"other parts become modified. This is a very important subject, most"
1228,"imperfectly understood. The most obvious case is, that modifications"
1228,"accumulated solely for the good of the young or larva, will, it may"
1228,"safely be concluded, affect the structure of the adult; in the same"
1228,"manner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo, seriously"
1228,affects the whole organisation of the adult. The several parts of the
1228,"body which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are"
1228,"alike, seem liable to vary in an allied manner: we see this in the right"
1228,and left sides of the body varying in the same manner; in the front and
1228,"hind legs, and even in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the"
1228,"lower jaw is believed to be homologous with the limbs. These tendencies,"
1228,"I do not doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural"
1228,selection: thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on
1228,one side; and if this had been of any great use to the breed it might
1228,probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection.
1228,
1228,"Homologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to cohere;"
1228,this is often seen in monstrous plants; and nothing is more common than
1228,"the union of homologous parts in normal structures, as the union of the"
1228,petals of the corolla into a tube. Hard parts seem to affect the form of
1228,adjoining soft parts; it is believed by some authors that the diversity
1228,in the shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in
1228,the shape of their kidneys. Others believe that the shape of the pelvis
1228,in the human mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the
1228,"child. In snakes, according to Schlegel, the shape of the body and"
1228,the manner of swallowing determine the position of several of the most
1228,important viscera.
1228,
1228,The nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure.
1228,"M. Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire has forcibly remarked, that certain"
1228,"malconformations very frequently, and that others rarely coexist,"
1228,without our being able to assign any reason. What can be more singular
1228,"than the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats, and the"
1228,tortoise-shell colour with the female sex; the feathered feet and skin
1228,"between the outer toes in pigeons, and the presence of more or less down"
1228,"on the young birds when first hatched, with the future colour of their"
1228,"plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair and teeth in the naked"
1228,"Turkish dog, though here probably homology comes into play? With respect"
1228,"to this latter case of correlation, I think it can hardly be accidental,"
1228,that if we pick out the two orders of mammalia which are most
1228,"abnormal in their dermal coverings, viz. Cetacea (whales) and Edentata"
1228,"(armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters, etc.), that these are likewise the most"
1228,abnormal in their teeth.
1228,
1228,I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of
1228,"correlation in modifying important structures, independently of utility"
1228,"and, therefore, of natural selection, than that of the difference"
1228,between the outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and
1228,Umbelliferous plants. Every one knows the difference in the ray and
1228,"central florets of, for instance, the daisy, and this difference is"
1228,"often accompanied with the abortion of parts of the flower. But, in some"
1228,"Compositous plants, the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture; and"
1228,"even the ovary itself, with its accessory parts, differs, as has been"
1228,described by Cassini. These differences have been attributed by some
1228,"authors to pressure, and the shape of the seeds in the ray-florets in"
1228,"some Compositae countenances this idea; but, in the case of the corolla"
1228,"of the Umbelliferae, it is by no means, as Dr. Hooker informs me, in"
1228,species with the densest heads that the inner and outer flowers most
1228,frequently differ. It might have been thought that the development of
1228,the ray-petals by drawing nourishment from certain other parts of the
1228,flower had caused their abortion; but in some Compositae there is a
1228,difference in the seeds of the outer and inner florets without any
1228,"difference in the corolla. Possibly, these several differences may be"
1228,connected with some difference in the flow of nutriment towards the
1228,"central and external flowers: we know, at least, that in irregular"
1228,"flowers, those nearest to the axis are oftenest subject to peloria, and"
1228,"become regular. I may add, as an instance of this, and of a striking"
1228,"case of correlation, that I have recently observed in some garden"
1228,"pelargoniums, that the central flower of the truss often loses the"
1228,patches of darker colour in the two upper petals; and that when this
1228,"occurs, the adherent nectary is quite aborted; when the colour is"
1228,"absent from only one of the two upper petals, the nectary is only much"
1228,shortened.
1228,
1228,With respect to the difference in the corolla of the central and
1228,"exterior flowers of a head or umbel, I do not feel at all sure that C."
1228,"C. Sprengel's idea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose"
1228,agency is highly advantageous in the fertilisation of plants of these
1228,"two orders, is so far-fetched, as it may at first appear: and if it be"
1228,"advantageous, natural selection may have come into play. But in regard"
1228,to the differences both in the internal and external structure of the
1228,"seeds, which are not always correlated with any differences in the"
1228,"flowers, it seems impossible that they can be in any way advantageous"
1228,to the plant: yet in the Umbelliferae these differences are of such
1228,"apparent importance--the seeds being in some cases, according to Tausch,"
1228,orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central
1228,"flowers,--that the elder De Candolle founded his main divisions of"
1228,the order on analogous differences. Hence we see that modifications of
1228,"structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due to"
1228,"unknown laws of correlated growth, and without being, as far as we can"
1228,"see, of the slightest service to the species."
1228,
1228,"We may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth, structures"
1228,"which are common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are"
1228,simply due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired
1228,"through natural selection some one modification in structure, and, after"
1228,"thousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and"
1228,"these two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group"
1228,"of descendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be"
1228,"correlated in some necessary manner. So, again, I do not doubt that some"
1228,"apparent correlations, occurring throughout whole orders, are entirely"
1228,due to the manner alone in which natural selection can act. For
1228,"instance, Alph. De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never"
1228,found in fruits which do not open: I should explain the rule by the fact
1228,"that seeds could not gradually become winged through natural selection,"
1228,except in fruits which opened; so that the individual plants producing
1228,"seeds which were a little better fitted to be wafted further, might get"
1228,an advantage over those producing seed less fitted for dispersal; and
1228,this process could not possibly go on in fruit which did not open.
1228,
1228,"The elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same period,"
1228,"their law of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as Goethe"
1228,"expressed it, ""in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to"
1228,"economise on the other side."" I think this holds true to a certain"
1228,extent with our domestic productions: if nourishment flows to one part
1228,"or organ in excess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another"
1228,part; thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten
1228,readily. The same varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and
1228,nutritious foliage and a copious supply of oil-bearing seeds. When the
1228,"seeds in our fruits become atrophied, the fruit itself gains largely in"
1228,"size and quality. In our poultry, a large tuft of feathers on the head"
1228,"is generally accompanied by a diminished comb, and a large beard by"
1228,diminished wattles. With species in a state of nature it can hardly
1228,be maintained that the law is of universal application; but many good
1228,"observers, more especially botanists, believe in its truth. I will"
1228,"not, however, here give any instances, for I see hardly any way of"
1228,"distinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part being"
1228,largely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining
1228,"part being reduced by this same process or by disuse, and, on the other"
1228,"hand, the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the"
1228,excess of growth in another and adjoining part.
1228,
1228,"I suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been"
1228,"advanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more"
1228,"general principle, namely, that natural selection is continually"
1228,trying to economise in every part of the organisation. If under changed
1228,"conditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful, any"
1228,"diminution, however slight, in its development, will be seized on by"
1228,"natural selection, for it will profit the individual not to have its"
1228,nutriment wasted in building up an useless structure. I can thus
1228,only understand a fact with which I was much struck when examining
1228,"cirripedes, and of which many other instances could be given: namely,"
1228,"that when a cirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected,"
1228,it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace. This is the
1228,"case with the male Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner with the"
1228,Proteolepas: for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists of
1228,the three highly-important anterior segments of the head enormously
1228,"developed, and furnished with great nerves and muscles; but in the"
1228,"parasitic and protected Proteolepas, the whole anterior part of the"
1228,head is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the
1228,"prehensile antennae. Now the saving of a large and complex structure,"
1228,"when rendered superfluous by the parasitic habits of the Proteolepas,"
1228,"though effected by slow steps, would be a decided advantage to each"
1228,successive individual of the species; for in the struggle for life to
1228,"which every animal is exposed, each individual Proteolepas would have"
1228,"a better chance of supporting itself, by less nutriment being wasted in"
1228,developing a structure now become useless.
1228,
1228,"Thus, as I believe, natural selection will always succeed in the long"
1228,"run in reducing and saving every part of the organisation, as soon as it"
1228,"is rendered superfluous, without by any means causing some other part"
1228,"to be largely developed in a corresponding degree. And, conversely, that"
1228,natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing any
1228,"organ, without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of"
1228,some adjoining part.
1228,
1228,"It seems to be a rule, as remarked by Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, both in"
1228,"varieties and in species, that when any part or organ is repeated many"
1228,times in the structure of the same individual (as the vertebrae in
1228,"snakes, and the stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable;"
1228,"whereas the number of the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser"
1228,"numbers, is constant. The same author and some botanists have further"
1228,remarked that multiple parts are also very liable to variation in
1228,"structure. Inasmuch as this ""vegetative repetition,"" to use Professor"
1228,"Owen's expression, seems to be a sign of low organisation; the foregoing"
1228,"remark seems connected with the very general opinion of naturalists,"
1228,that beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those
1228,which are higher. I presume that lowness in this case means that the
1228,several parts of the organisation have been but little specialised
1228,for particular functions; and as long as the same part has to perform
1228,"diversified work, we can perhaps see why it should remain variable, that"
1228,"is, why natural selection should have preserved or rejected each little"
1228,deviation of form less carefully than when the part has to serve for one
1228,special purpose alone. In the same way that a knife which has to cut
1228,all sorts of things may be of almost any shape; whilst a tool for
1228,some particular object had better be of some particular shape. Natural
1228,"selection, it should never be forgotten, can act on each part of each"
1228,"being, solely through and for its advantage."
1228,
1228,"Rudimentary parts, it has been stated by some authors, and I believe"
1228,"with truth, are apt to be highly variable. We shall have to recur to the"
1228,general subject of rudimentary and aborted organs; and I will here only
1228,"add that their variability seems to be owing to their uselessness, and"
1228,therefore to natural selection having no power to check deviations in
1228,their structure. Thus rudimentary parts are left to the free play of the
1228,"various laws of growth, to the effects of long-continued disuse, and to"
1228,the tendency to reversion.
1228,
1228,"A PART DEVELOPED IN ANY SPECIES IN AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OR MANNER,"
1228,"IN COMPARISON WITH THE SAME PART IN ALLIED SPECIES, TENDS TO BE HIGHLY"
1228,VARIABLE.
1228,
1228,"Several years ago I was much struck with a remark, nearly to the above"
1228,"effect, published by Mr. Waterhouse. I infer also from an observation"
1228,"made by Professor Owen, with respect to the length of the arms of the"
1228,"ourang-outang, that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion. It is"
1228,hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of this proposition
1228,"without giving the long array of facts which I have collected, and which"
1228,cannot possibly be here introduced. I can only state my conviction that
1228,it is a rule of high generality. I am aware of several causes of
1228,"error, but I hope that I have made due allowance for them. It should"
1228,"be understood that the rule by no means applies to any part, however"
1228,"unusually developed, unless it be unusually developed in comparison with"
1228,"the same part in closely allied species. Thus, the bat's wing is a most"
1228,abnormal structure in the class mammalia; but the rule would not here
1228,"apply, because there is a whole group of bats having wings; it would"
1228,apply only if some one species of bat had its wings developed in some
1228,remarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the same
1228,genus. The rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexual
1228,"characters, when displayed in any unusual manner. The term, secondary"
1228,"sexual characters, used by Hunter, applies to characters which are"
1228,"attached to one sex, but are not directly connected with the act of"
1228,reproduction. The rule applies to males and females; but as females more
1228,"rarely offer remarkable secondary sexual characters, it applies more"
1228,rarely to them. The rule being so plainly applicable in the case of
1228,"secondary sexual characters, may be due to the great variability of"
1228,"these characters, whether or not displayed in any unusual manner--of"
1228,which fact I think there can be little doubt. But that our rule is not
1228,confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case
1228,"of hermaphrodite cirripedes; and I may here add, that I particularly"
1228,"attended to Mr. Waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating this Order,"
1228,and I am fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds good
1228,"with cirripedes. I shall, in my future work, give a list of the more"
1228,"remarkable cases; I will here only briefly give one, as it illustrates"
1228,the rule in its largest application. The opercular valves of sessile
1228,"cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in every sense of the word, very"
1228,"important structures, and they differ extremely little even in different"
1228,"genera; but in the several species of one genus, Pyrgoma, these valves"
1228,present a marvellous amount of diversification: the homologous valves
1228,in the different species being sometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the
1228,amount of variation in the individuals of several of the species is so
1228,"great, that it is no exaggeration to state that the varieties differ"
1228,more from each other in the characters of these important valves than do
1228,other species of distinct genera.
1228,
1228,"As birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree, I"
1228,"have particularly attended to them, and the rule seems to me certainly"
1228,"to hold good in this class. I cannot make out that it applies to plants,"
1228,"and this would seriously have shaken my belief in its truth, had not the"
1228,great variability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare
1228,their relative degrees of variability.
1228,
1228,When we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner
1228,"in any species, the fair presumption is that it is of high importance to"
1228,that species; nevertheless the part in this case is eminently liable to
1228,variation. Why should this be so? On the view that each species has been
1228,"independently created, with all its parts as we now see them, I can see"
1228,no explanation. But on the view that groups of species have descended
1228,"from other species, and have been modified through natural selection, I"
1228,"think we can obtain some light. In our domestic animals, if any part,"
1228,"or the whole animal, be neglected and no selection be applied, that part"
1228,"(for instance, the comb in the Dorking fowl) or the whole breed will"
1228,cease to have a nearly uniform character. The breed will then be said
1228,"to have degenerated. In rudimentary organs, and in those which have"
1228,"been but little specialised for any particular purpose, and perhaps in"
1228,"polymorphic groups, we see a nearly parallel natural case; for in such"
1228,"cases natural selection either has not or cannot come into full play,"
1228,and thus the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition. But what
1228,"here more especially concerns us is, that in our domestic animals"
1228,"those points, which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by"
1228,"continued selection, are also eminently liable to variation. Look at the"
1228,breeds of the pigeon; see what a prodigious amount of difference there
1228,"is in the beak of the different tumblers, in the beak and wattle of"
1228,"the different carriers, in the carriage and tail of our fantails, etc.,"
1228,these being the points now mainly attended to by English fanciers. Even
1228,"in the sub-breeds, as in the short-faced tumbler, it is notoriously"
1228,"difficult to breed them nearly to perfection, and frequently individuals"
1228,are born which depart widely from the standard. There may be truly
1228,"said to be a constant struggle going on between, on the one hand, the"
1228,"tendency to reversion to a less modified state, as well as an innate"
1228,"tendency to further variability of all kinds, and, on the other hand,"
1228,the power of steady selection to keep the breed true. In the long run
1228,"selection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so far as to breed"
1228,a bird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good short-faced strain. But
1228,"as long as selection is rapidly going on, there may always be expected"
1228,to be much variability in the structure undergoing modification. It
1228,"further deserves notice that these variable characters, produced by"
1228,"man's selection, sometimes become attached, from causes quite unknown"
1228,"to us, more to one sex than to the other, generally to the male sex, as"
1228,with the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters.
1228,
1228,Now let us turn to nature. When a part has been developed in an
1228,"extraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species"
1228,"of the same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone an"
1228,"extraordinary amount of modification, since the period when the species"
1228,branched off from the common progenitor of the genus. This period will
1228,"seldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species very rarely endure"
1228,for more than one geological period. An extraordinary amount of
1228,modification implies an unusually large and long-continued amount of
1228,"variability, which has continually been accumulated by natural"
1228,selection for the benefit of the species. But as the variability of
1228,the extraordinarily-developed part or organ has been so great and
1228,"long-continued within a period not excessively remote, we might, as a"
1228,"general rule, expect still to find more variability in such parts than"
1228,"in other parts of the organisation, which have remained for a much"
1228,"longer period nearly constant. And this, I am convinced, is the case."
1228,"That the struggle between natural selection on the one hand, and the"
1228,"tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand, will in the"
1228,course of time cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs may
1228,"be made constant, I can see no reason to doubt. Hence when an organ,"
1228,"however abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in approximately the"
1228,"same condition to many modified descendants, as in the case of the wing"
1228,"of the bat, it must have existed, according to my theory, for an"
1228,immense period in nearly the same state; and thus it comes to be no more
1228,variable than any other structure. It is only in those cases in which
1228,the modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great
1228,"that we ought to find the GENERATIVE VARIABILITY, as it may be called,"
1228,still present in a high degree. For in this case the variability
1228,will seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the
1228,"individuals varying in the required manner and degree, and by the"
1228,continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less
1228,modified condition.
1228,
1228,The principle included in these remarks may be extended. It is notorious
1228,that specific characters are more variable than generic. To explain by a
1228,simple example what is meant. If some species in a large genus of plants
1228,"had blue flowers and some had red, the colour would be only a specific"
1228,"character, and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species"
1228,"varying into red, or conversely; but if all the species had blue"
1228,"flowers, the colour would become a generic character, and its variation"
1228,would be a more unusual circumstance. I have chosen this example because
1228,"an explanation is not in this case applicable, which most naturalists"
1228,"would advance, namely, that specific characters are more variable"
1228,"than generic, because they are taken from parts of less physiological"
1228,importance than those commonly used for classing genera. I believe this
1228,"explanation is partly, yet only indirectly, true; I shall, however, have"
1228,to return to this subject in our chapter on Classification. It would be
1228,"almost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the above statement,"
1228,that specific characters are more variable than generic; but I have
1228,"repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that when an author"
1228,"has remarked with surprise that some IMPORTANT organ or part, which is"
1228,"generally very constant throughout large groups of species, has DIFFERED"
1228,"considerably in closely-allied species, that it has, also, been VARIABLE"
1228,in the individuals of some of the species. And this fact shows that a
1228,"character, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value"
1228,"and becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its"
1228,physiological importance may remain the same. Something of the same kind
1228,applies to monstrosities: at least Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire seems to
1228,"entertain no doubt, that the more an organ normally differs in"
1228,"the different species of the same group, the more subject it is to"
1228,individual anomalies.
1228,
1228,"On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,"
1228,"why should that part of the structure, which differs from the same"
1228,"part in other independently-created species of the same genus, be"
1228,more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several
1228,species? I do not see that any explanation can be given. But on the
1228,"view of species being only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might"
1228,surely expect to find them still often continuing to vary in those parts
1228,"of their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period,"
1228,and which have thus come to differ. Or to state the case in another
1228,manner:--the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each
1228,"other, and in which they differ from the species of some other genus,"
1228,are called generic characters; and these characters in common I
1228,"attribute to inheritance from a common progenitor, for it can rarely"
1228,"have happened that natural selection will have modified several species,"
1228,"fitted to more or less widely-different habits, in exactly the same"
1228,manner: and as these so-called generic characters have been inherited
1228,"from a remote period, since that period when the species first branched"
1228,"off from their common progenitor, and subsequently have not varied or"
1228,"come to differ in any degree, or only in a slight degree, it is not"
1228,"probable that they should vary at the present day. On the other hand,"
1228,"the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus,"
1228,are called specific characters; and as these specific characters have
1228,varied and come to differ within the period of the branching off of the
1228,"species from a common progenitor, it is probable that they should still"
1228,"often be in some degree variable,--at least more variable than those"
1228,parts of the organisation which have for a very long period remained
1228,constant.
1228,
1228,"In connexion with the present subject, I will make only two other"
1228,"remarks. I think it will be admitted, without my entering on details,"
1228,that secondary sexual characters are very variable; I think it also will
1228,be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more
1228,"widely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts of"
1228,"their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference"
1228,"between the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual"
1228,"characters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between"
1228,their females; and the truth of this proposition will be granted. The
1228,cause of the original variability of secondary sexual characters is
1228,not manifest; but we can see why these characters should not have been
1228,rendered as constant and uniform as other parts of the organisation; for
1228,"secondary sexual characters have been accumulated by sexual selection,"
1228,"which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does"
1228,"not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured"
1228,males. Whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual
1228,"characters, as they are highly variable, sexual selection will have had"
1228,"a wide scope for action, and may thus readily have succeeded in giving"
1228,to the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in their
1228,"sexual characters, than in other parts of their structure."
1228,
1228,"It is a remarkable fact, that the secondary sexual differences between"
1228,the two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very
1228,same parts of the organisation in which the different species of
1228,the same genus differ from each other. Of this fact I will give in
1228,"illustration two instances, the first which happen to stand on my list;"
1228,"and as the differences in these cases are of a very unusual nature,"
1228,the relation can hardly be accidental. The same number of joints in the
1228,"tarsi is a character generally common to very large groups of beetles,"
1228,"but in the Engidae, as Westwood has remarked, the number varies greatly;"
1228,and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same species:
1228,"again in fossorial hymenoptera, the manner of neuration of the wings is"
1228,"a character of the highest importance, because common to large groups;"
1228,"but in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species,"
1228,and likewise in the two sexes of the same species. This relation has a
1228,clear meaning on my view of the subject: I look at all the species
1228,of the same genus as having as certainly descended from the same
1228,"progenitor, as have the two sexes of any one of the species."
1228,"Consequently, whatever part of the structure of the common progenitor,"
1228,"or of its early descendants, became variable; variations of this part"
1228,"would it is highly probable, be taken advantage of by natural and sexual"
1228,"selection, in order to fit the several species to their several places"
1228,"in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same"
1228,"species to each other, or to fit the males and females to different"
1228,"habits of life, or the males to struggle with other males for the"
1228,possession of the females.
1228,
1228,"Finally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific"
1228,"characters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of"
1228,"generic characters, or those which the species possess in common;--that"
1228,the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a
1228,species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part
1228,"in its congeners; and the not great degree of variability in a part,"
1228,"however extraordinarily it may be developed, if it be common to a"
1228,whole group of species;--that the great variability of secondary sexual
1228,"characters, and the great amount of difference in these same characters"
1228,between closely allied species;--that secondary sexual and ordinary
1228,specific differences are generally displayed in the same parts of the
1228,"organisation,--are all principles closely connected together. All being"
1228,mainly due to the species of the same group having descended from a
1228,"common progenitor, from whom they have inherited much in common,--to"
1228,parts which have recently and largely varied being more likely still
1228,to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and have not
1228,"varied,--to natural selection having more or less completely, according"
1228,"to the lapse of time, overmastered the tendency to reversion and to"
1228,"further variability,--to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary"
1228,"selection,--and to variations in the same parts having been accumulated"
1228,"by natural and sexual selection, and thus adapted for secondary sexual,"
1228,and for ordinary specific purposes.
1228,
1228,DISTINCT SPECIES PRESENT ANALOGOUS VARIATIONS; AND A VARIETY OF ONE
1228,"SPECIES OFTEN ASSUMES SOME OF THE CHARACTERS OF AN ALLIED SPECIES, OR"
1228,REVERTS TO SOME OF THE CHARACTERS OF AN EARLY PROGENITOR.
1228,
1228,These propositions will be most readily understood by looking to our
1228,"domestic races. The most distinct breeds of pigeons, in countries most"
1228,"widely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the head"
1228,"and feathers on the feet,--characters not possessed by the aboriginal"
1228,rock-pigeon; these then are analogous variations in two or more distinct
1228,races. The frequent presence of fourteen or even sixteen tail-feathers
1228,"in the pouter, may be considered as a variation representing the normal"
1228,"structure of another race, the fantail. I presume that no one will doubt"
1228,that all such analogous variations are due to the several races of the
1228,pigeon having inherited from a common parent the same constitution and
1228,"tendency to variation, when acted on by similar unknown influences."
1228,"In the vegetable kingdom we have a case of analogous variation, in the"
1228,"enlarged stems, or roots as commonly called, of the Swedish turnip and"
1228,"Ruta baga, plants which several botanists rank as varieties produced by"
1228,"cultivation from a common parent: if this be not so, the case will then"
1228,be one of analogous variation in two so-called distinct species; and to
1228,"these a third may be added, namely, the common turnip. According to"
1228,"the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, we"
1228,should have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of these
1228,"three plants, not to the vera causa of community of descent, and a"
1228,"consequent tendency to vary in a like manner, but to three separate yet"
1228,closely related acts of creation.
1228,
1228,"With pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the occasional"
1228,"appearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars"
1228,"on the wings, a white rump, a bar at the end of the tail, with the outer"
1228,feathers externally edged near their bases with white. As all these
1228,"marks are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no"
1228,"one will doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet"
1228,analogous variation appearing in the several breeds. We may I think
1228,"confidently come to this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these"
1228,coloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring
1228,of two distinct and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there
1228,is nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance
1228,"of the slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the"
1228,mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.
1228,
1228,No doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear
1228,"after having been lost for many, perhaps for hundreds of generations."
1228,"But when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the"
1228,offspring occasionally show a tendency to revert in character to the
1228,"foreign breed for many generations--some say, for a dozen or even a"
1228,"score of generations. After twelve generations, the proportion of blood,"
1228,"to use a common expression, of any one ancestor, is only  in ; and"
1228,"yet, as we see, it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion"
1228,is retained by this very small proportion of foreign blood. In a breed
1228,"which has not been crossed, but in which BOTH parents have lost some"
1228,"character which their progenitor possessed, the tendency, whether strong"
1228,"or weak, to reproduce the lost character might be, as was formerly"
1228,"remarked, for all that we can see to the contrary, transmitted for"
1228,almost any number of generations. When a character which has been lost
1228,"in a breed, reappears after a great number of generations, the most"
1228,"probable hypothesis is, not that the offspring suddenly takes after an"
1228,"ancestor some hundred generations distant, but that in each successive"
1228,generation there has been a tendency to reproduce the character in
1228,"question, which at last, under unknown favourable conditions, gains an"
1228,"ascendancy. For instance, it is probable that in each generation of the"
1228,"barb-pigeon, which produces most rarely a blue and black-barred bird,"
1228,there has been a tendency in each generation in the plumage to assume
1228,"this colour. This view is hypothetical, but could be supported by some"
1228,facts; and I can see no more abstract improbability in a tendency
1228,to produce any character being inherited for an endless number of
1228,"generations, than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being, as we"
1228,"all know them to be, thus inherited. Indeed, we may sometimes observe"
1228,"a mere tendency to produce a rudiment inherited: for instance, in the"
1228,common snapdragon (Antirrhinum) a rudiment of a fifth stamen so often
1228,"appears, that this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce it."
1228,
1228,"As all the species of the same genus are supposed, on my theory, to have"
1228,"descended from a common parent, it might be expected that they would"
1228,occasionally vary in an analogous manner; so that a variety of one
1228,species would resemble in some of its characters another species; this
1228,other species being on my view only a well-marked and permanent variety.
1228,"But characters thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature,"
1228,for the presence of all important characters will be governed by natural
1228,"selection, in accordance with the diverse habits of the species, and"
1228,will not be left to the mutual action of the conditions of life and of
1228,a similar inherited constitution. It might further be expected that the
1228,species of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost
1228,"ancestral characters. As, however, we never know the exact character"
1228,"of the common ancestor of a group, we could not distinguish these two"
1228,"cases: if, for instance, we did not know that the rock-pigeon was not"
1228,"feather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not have told, whether these"
1228,characters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous
1228,variations; but we might have inferred that the blueness was a case of
1228,"reversion, from the number of the markings, which are correlated with"
1228,"the blue tint, and which it does not appear probable would all appear"
1228,together from simple variation. More especially we might have inferred
1228,"this, from the blue colour and marks so often appearing when distinct"
1228,"breeds of diverse colours are crossed. Hence, though under nature"
1228,"it must generally be left doubtful, what cases are reversions to an"
1228,"anciently existing character, and what are new but analogous variations,"
1228,"yet we ought, on my theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring of"
1228,a species assuming characters (either from reversion or from analogous
1228,variation) which already occur in some other members of the same group.
1228,And this undoubtedly is the case in nature.
1228,
1228,A considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable species
1228,"in our systematic works, is due to its varieties mocking, as it were,"
1228,"some of the other species of the same genus. A considerable catalogue,"
1228,"also, could be given of forms intermediate between two other forms,"
1228,which themselves must be doubtfully ranked as either varieties or
1228,"species; and this shows, unless all these forms be considered as"
1228,"independently created species, that the one in varying has assumed some"
1228,"of the characters of the other, so as to produce the intermediate form."
1228,But the best evidence is afforded by parts or organs of an important and
1228,"uniform nature occasionally varying so as to acquire, in some degree,"
1228,the character of the same part or organ in an allied species. I have
1228,"collected a long list of such cases; but here, as before, I lie under"
1228,a great disadvantage in not being able to give them. I can only repeat
1228,"that such cases certainly do occur, and seem to me very remarkable."
1228,
1228,"I will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as"
1228,"affecting any important character, but from occurring in several species"
1228,"of the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under nature."
1228,It is a case apparently of reversion. The ass not rarely has very
1228,"distinct transverse bars on its legs, like those on the legs of a zebra:"
1228,"it has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal, and from"
1228,"inquiries which I have made, I believe this to be true. It has also"
1228,been asserted that the stripe on each shoulder is sometimes double.
1228,The shoulder stripe is certainly very variable in length and outline. A
1228,"white ass, but NOT an albino, has been described without either spinal"
1228,"or shoulder-stripe; and these stripes are sometimes very obscure, or"
1228,"actually quite lost, in dark-coloured asses. The koulan of Pallas is"
1228,said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe. The hemionus has
1228,"no shoulder-stripe; but traces of it, as stated by Mr. Blyth and others,"
1228,occasionally appear: and I have been informed by Colonel Poole that the
1228,"foals of this species are generally striped on the legs, and faintly on"
1228,"the shoulder. The quagga, though so plainly barred like a zebra over the"
1228,"body, is without bars on the legs; but Dr. Gray has figured one specimen"
1228,with very distinct zebra-like bars on the hocks.
1228,
1228,"With respect to the horse, I have collected cases in England of the"
1228,"spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of ALL colours;"
1228,"transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns, and in one"
1228,instance in a chestnut: a faint shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen
1228,"in duns, and I have seen a trace in a bay horse. My son made a careful"
1228,examination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian cart-horse with a double
1228,"stripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes; and a man, whom I can"
1228,"implicitly trust, has examined for me a small dun Welch pony with THREE"
1228,short parallel stripes on each shoulder.
1228,
1228,In the north-west part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so
1228,"generally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who examined"
1228,"the breed for the Indian Government, a horse without stripes is not"
1228,considered as purely-bred. The spine is always striped; the legs are
1228,"generally barred; and the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double"
1228,"and sometimes treble, is common; the side of the face, moreover, is"
1228,sometimes striped. The stripes are plainest in the foal; and sometimes
1228,quite disappear in old horses. Colonel Poole has seen both gray and
1228,"bay Kattywar horses striped when first foaled. I have, also, reason to"
1228,"suspect, from information given me by Mr. W. W. Edwards, that with the"
1228,English race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal than
1228,"in the full-grown animal. Without here entering on further details, I"
1228,may state that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in
1228,"horses of very different breeds, in various countries from Britain to"
1228,Eastern China; and from Norway in the north to the Malay Archipelago in
1228,the south. In all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest
1228,in duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of colour is
1228,"included, from one between brown and black to a close approach to"
1228,cream-colour.
1228,
1228,"I am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith, who has written on this subject,"
1228,believes that the several breeds of the horse have descended from
1228,"several aboriginal species--one of which, the dun, was striped; and that"
1228,the above-described appearances are all due to ancient crosses with the
1228,"dun stock. But I am not at all satisfied with this theory, and should be"
1228,"loth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy Belgian cart-horse,"
1228,"Welch ponies, cobs, the lanky Kattywar race, etc., inhabiting the most"
1228,distant parts of the world.
1228,
1228,Now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the
1228,"horse-genus. Rollin asserts, that the common mule from the ass and horse"
1228,is particularly apt to have bars on its legs. I once saw a mule with its
1228,legs so much striped that any one at first would have thought that it
1228,"must have been the product of a zebra; and Mr. W. C. Martin, in his"
1228,"excellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of a similar mule."
1228,"In four coloured drawings, which I have seen, of hybrids between the ass"
1228,"and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest of the"
1228,body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe. In Lord
1228,"Moreton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the"
1228,"hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare"
1228,"by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the"
1228,"legs than is even the pure quagga. Lastly, and this is another most"
1228,"remarkable case, a hybrid has been figured by Dr. Gray (and he informs"
1228,me that he knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus; and
1228,"this hybrid, though the ass seldom has stripes on its legs and the"
1228,"hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe, nevertheless had"
1228,"all four legs barred, and had three short shoulder-stripes, like those"
1228,"on the dun Welch pony, and even had some zebra-like stripes on the sides"
1228,"of its face. With respect to this last fact, I was so convinced that not"
1228,even a stripe of colour appears from what would commonly be called an
1228,"accident, that I was led solely from the occurrence of the face-stripes"
1228,"on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus, to ask Colonel Poole whether"
1228,such face-stripes ever occur in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of
1228,"horses, and was, as we have seen, answered in the affirmative."
1228,
1228,What now are we to say to these several facts? We see several very
1228,"distinct species of the horse-genus becoming, by simple variation,"
1228,"striped on the legs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like"
1228,an ass. In the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint
1228,appears--a tint which approaches to that of the general colouring of
1228,the other species of the genus. The appearance of the stripes is not
1228,accompanied by any change of form or by any other new character. We see
1228,this tendency to become striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from
1228,between several of the most distinct species. Now observe the case
1228,of the several breeds of pigeons: they are descended from a pigeon
1228,(including two or three sub-species or geographical races) of a bluish
1228,"colour, with certain bars and other marks; and when any breed assumes"
1228,"by simple variation a bluish tint, these bars and other marks invariably"
1228,reappear; but without any other change of form or character. When the
1228,"oldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed, we see a"
1228,strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear in the
1228,mongrels. I have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account
1228,"for the reappearance of very ancient characters, is--that there is"
1228,a TENDENCY in the young of each successive generation to produce the
1228,"long-lost character, and that this tendency, from unknown causes,"
1228,sometimes prevails. And we have just seen that in several species of the
1228,horse-genus the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in
1228,"the young than in the old. Call the breeds of pigeons, some of which"
1228,"have bred true for centuries, species; and how exactly parallel is the"
1228,"case with that of the species of the horse-genus! For myself, I venture"
1228,"confidently to look back thousands on thousands of generations, and"
1228,"I see an animal striped like a zebra, but perhaps otherwise very"
1228,"differently constructed, the common parent of our domestic horse,"
1228,"whether or not it be descended from one or more wild stocks, of the ass,"
1228,"the hemionus, quagga, and zebra."
1228,
1228,"He who believes that each equine species was independently created,"
1228,"will, I presume, assert that each species has been created with a"
1228,"tendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in this"
1228,"particular manner, so as often to become striped like other species of"
1228,"the genus; and that each has been created with a strong tendency,"
1228,"when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world, to"
1228,"produce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not their own parents, but"
1228,"other species of the genus. To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to"
1228,"reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause. It makes"
1228,the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon
1228,"believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had"
1228,"never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now"
1228,living on the sea-shore.
1228,
1228,SUMMARY.
1228,
1228,Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. Not in one case out
1228,of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part
1228,"differs, more or less, from the same part in the parents. But whenever"
1228,"we have the means of instituting a comparison, the same laws appear to"
1228,have acted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of the
1228,"same species, and the greater differences between species of the same"
1228,"genus. The external conditions of life, as climate and food, etc.,"
1228,seem to have induced some slight modifications. Habit in producing
1228,"constitutional differences, and use in strengthening, and disuse in"
1228,"weakening and diminishing organs, seem to have been more potent in their"
1228,"effects. Homologous parts tend to vary in the same way, and homologous"
1228,parts tend to cohere. Modifications in hard parts and in external parts
1228,sometimes affect softer and internal parts. When one part is largely
1228,"developed, perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from the adjoining"
1228,parts; and every part of the structure which can be saved without
1228,"detriment to the individual, will be saved. Changes of structure at an"
1228,early age will generally affect parts subsequently developed; and there
1228,"are very many other correlations of growth, the nature of which we are"
1228,utterly unable to understand. Multiple parts are variable in number and
1228,"in structure, perhaps arising from such parts not having been closely"
1228,"specialised to any particular function, so that their modifications have"
1228,not been closely checked by natural selection. It is probably from
1228,this same cause that organic beings low in the scale of nature are
1228,more variable than those which have their whole organisation more
1228,"specialised, and are higher in the scale. Rudimentary organs, from being"
1228,"useless, will be disregarded by natural selection, and hence probably"
1228,"are variable. Specific characters--that is, the characters which have"
1228,come to differ since the several species of the same genus branched
1228,"off from a common parent--are more variable than generic characters, or"
1228,"those which have long been inherited, and have not differed within"
1228,this same period. In these remarks we have referred to special parts or
1228,"organs being still variable, because they have recently varied and thus"
1228,come to differ; but we have also seen in the second Chapter that the
1228,same principle applies to the whole individual; for in a district where
1228,"many species of any genus are found--that is, where there has been much"
1228,"former variation and differentiation, or where the manufactory of new"
1228,"specific forms has been actively at work--there, on an average, we now"
1228,find most varieties or incipient species. Secondary sexual characters
1228,"are highly variable, and such characters differ much in the species of"
1228,the same group. Variability in the same parts of the organisation has
1228,generally been taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differences
1228,"to the sexes of the same species, and specific differences to the"
1228,several species of the same genus. Any part or organ developed to an
1228,"extraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner, in comparison with"
1228,"the same part or organ in the allied species, must have gone through an"
1228,extraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose; and thus we
1228,can understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher
1228,degree than other parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow
1228,"process, and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had"
1228,time to overcome the tendency to further variability and to
1228,reversion to a less modified state. But when a species with any
1228,extraordinarily-developed organ has become the parent of many modified
1228,"descendants--which on my view must be a very slow process, requiring"
1228,"a long lapse of time--in this case, natural selection may readily"
1228,"have succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ, in however"
1228,extraordinary a manner it may be developed. Species inheriting nearly
1228,the same constitution from a common parent and exposed to similar
1228,"influences will naturally tend to present analogous variations, and"
1228,these same species may occasionally revert to some of the characters of
1228,their ancient progenitors. Although new and important modifications may
1228,"not arise from reversion and analogous variation, such modifications"
1228,will add to the beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature.
1228,
1228,Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring
1228,from their parents--and a cause for each must exist--it is the steady
1228,"accumulation, through natural selection, of such differences, when"
1228,"beneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all the more important"
1228,"modifications of structure, by which the innumerable beings on the face"
1228,"of this earth are enabled to struggle with each other, and the best"
1228,adapted to survive.

1228,. DIFFICULTIES ON THEORY.
1228,
1228,Difficulties on the theory of descent with modification. Transitions.
1228,Absence or rarity of transitional varieties. Transitions in habits of
1228,life. Diversified habits in the same species. Species with habits widely
1228,different from those of their allies. Organs of extreme perfection.
1228,Means of transition. Cases of difficulty. Natura non facit saltum.
1228,Organs of small importance. Organs not in all cases absolutely perfect.
1228,The law of Unity of Type and of the Conditions of Existence embraced by
1228,the theory of Natural Selection.
1228,
1228,"Long before having arrived at this part of my work, a crowd of"
1228,difficulties will have occurred to the reader. Some of them are so grave
1228,that to this day I can never reflect on them without being staggered;
1228,"but, to the best of my judgment, the greater number are only apparent,"
1228,"and those that are real are not, I think, fatal to my theory."
1228,
1228,These difficulties and objections may be classed under the following
1228,heads:--
1228,
1228,"Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly"
1228,"fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional"
1228,"forms? Why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being,"
1228,"as we see them, well defined?"
1228,
1228,"Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance,"
1228,"the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the"
1228,modification of some animal with wholly different habits? Can we
1228,"believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs"
1228,"of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a"
1228,"fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of such wonderful structure,"
1228,"as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable"
1228,perfection?
1228,
1228,"Thirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural"
1228,selection? What shall we say to so marvellous an instinct as that which
1228,"leads the bee to make cells, which have practically anticipated the"
1228,discoveries of profound mathematicians?
1228,
1228,"Fourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being sterile"
1228,"and producing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are crossed,"
1228,their fertility is unimpaired?
1228,
1228,The two first heads shall be here discussed--Instinct and Hybridism in
1228,separate chapters.
1228,
1228,ON THE ABSENCE OR RARITY OF TRANSITIONAL VARIETIES.
1228,
1228,As natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable
1228,"modifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to"
1228,"take the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved"
1228,parent or other less-favoured forms with which it comes into
1228,"competition. Thus extinction and natural selection will, as we have"
1228,"seen, go hand in hand. Hence, if we look at each species as descended"
1228,"from some other unknown form, both the parent and all the transitional"
1228,varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process of
1228,formation and perfection of the new form.
1228,
1228,"But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed,"
1228,why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of
1228,the earth? It will be much more convenient to discuss this question in
1228,the chapter on the Imperfection of the geological record; and I will
1228,here only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record
1228,being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed; the
1228,imperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings not
1228,"inhabiting profound depths of the sea, and to their remains being"
1228,embedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment
1228,sufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of
1228,future degradation; and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulated
1228,"only where much sediment is deposited on the shallow bed of the sea,"
1228,"whilst it slowly subsides. These contingencies will concur only rarely,"
1228,and after enormously long intervals. Whilst the bed of the sea
1228,"is stationary or is rising, or when very little sediment is being"
1228,"deposited, there will be blanks in our geological history. The crust of"
1228,the earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been made
1228,only at intervals of time immensely remote.
1228,
1228,But it may be urged that when several closely-allied species inhabit
1228,the same territory we surely ought to find at the present time many
1228,transitional forms. Let us take a simple case: in travelling from north
1228,"to south over a continent, we generally meet at successive intervals"
1228,"with closely allied or representative species, evidently filling nearly"
1228,the same place in the natural economy of the land. These representative
1228,species often meet and interlock; and as the one becomes rarer and
1228,"rarer, the other becomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces"
1228,"the other. But if we compare these species where they intermingle, they"
1228,are generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of
1228,structure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each.
1228,By my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent;
1228,"and during the process of modification, each has become adapted to"
1228,"the conditions of life of its own region, and has supplanted and"
1228,exterminated its original parent and all the transitional varieties
1228,between its past and present states. Hence we ought not to expect at
1228,the present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in each
1228,"region, though they must have existed there, and may be embedded"
1228,"there in a fossil condition. But in the intermediate region, having"
1228,"intermediate conditions of life, why do we not now find closely-linking"
1228,intermediate varieties? This difficulty for a long time quite confounded
1228,me. But I think it can be in large part explained.
1228,
1228,"In the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring, because"
1228,"an area is now continuous, that it has been continuous during a long"
1228,period. Geology would lead us to believe that almost every continent has
1228,been broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods;
1228,and in such islands distinct species might have been separately formed
1228,without the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the
1228,"intermediate zones. By changes in the form of the land and of climate,"
1228,marine areas now continuous must often have existed within recent times
1228,in a far less continuous and uniform condition than at present. But I
1228,will pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty; for I believe
1228,that many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly
1228,continuous areas; though I do not doubt that the formerly broken
1228,condition of areas now continuous has played an important part in the
1228,"formation of new species, more especially with freely-crossing and"
1228,wandering animals.
1228,
1228,"In looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area,"
1228,"we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then"
1228,"becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally"
1228,disappearing. Hence the neutral territory between two representative
1228,species is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to
1228,"each. We see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes it"
1228,"is quite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph. De Candolle has observed,"
1228,a common alpine species disappears. The same fact has been noticed by
1228,Forbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. To those who
1228,look at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important
1228,"elements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as"
1228,climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly. But when we
1228,"bear in mind that almost every species, even in its metropolis, would"
1228,"increase immensely in numbers, were it not for other competing species;"
1228,"that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others; in short,"
1228,that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in
1228,"the most important manner to other organic beings, we must see that the"
1228,range of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends
1228,"on insensibly changing physical conditions, but in large part on the"
1228,"presence of other species, on which it depends, or by which it is"
1228,"destroyed, or with which it comes into competition; and as these species"
1228,"are already defined objects (however they may have become so), not"
1228,"blending one into another by insensible gradations, the range of any one"
1228,"species, depending as it does on the range of others, will tend to be"
1228,"sharply defined. Moreover, each species on the confines of its range,"
1228,"where it exists in lessened numbers, will, during fluctuations in the"
1228,"number of its enemies or of its prey, or in the seasons, be extremely"
1228,liable to utter extermination; and thus its geographical range will come
1228,to be still more sharply defined.
1228,
1228,"If I am right in believing that allied or representative species, when"
1228,"inhabiting a continuous area, are generally so distributed that each"
1228,"has a wide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between"
1228,"them, in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as"
1228,"varieties do not essentially differ from species, the same rule will"
1228,probably apply to both; and if we in imagination adapt a varying species
1228,"to a very large area, we shall have to adapt two varieties to two"
1228,"large areas, and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone. The"
1228,"intermediate variety, consequently, will exist in lesser numbers from"
1228,"inhabiting a narrow and lesser area; and practically, as far as I can"
1228,"make out, this rule holds good with varieties in a state of nature. I"
1228,have met with striking instances of the rule in the case of varieties
1228,intermediate between well-marked varieties in the genus Balanus. And it
1228,"would appear from information given me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and"
1228,"Mr. Wollaston, that generally when varieties intermediate between two"
1228,"other forms occur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms which"
1228,"they connect. Now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and"
1228,therefore conclude that varieties linking two other varieties together
1228,have generally existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they
1228,"connect, then, I think, we can understand why intermediate varieties"
1228,should not endure for very long periods;--why as a general rule they
1228,"should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they"
1228,originally linked together.
1228,
1228,"For any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked,"
1228,run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large
1228,numbers; and in this particular case the intermediate form would be
1228,eminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both
1228,"sides of it. But a far more important consideration, as I believe, is"
1228,"that, during the process of further modification, by which two varieties"
1228,are supposed on my theory to be converted and perfected into two
1228,"distinct species, the two which exist in larger numbers from inhabiting"
1228,"larger areas, will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety,"
1228,which exists in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone.
1228,"For forms existing in larger numbers will always have a better chance,"
1228,"within any given period, of presenting further favourable variations for"
1228,"natural selection to seize on, than will the rarer forms which exist in"
1228,"lesser numbers. Hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will"
1228,"tend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be"
1228,"more slowly modified and improved. It is the same principle which, as"
1228,"I believe, accounts for the common species in each country, as shown"
1228,"in the second chapter, presenting on an average a greater number of"
1228,well-marked varieties than do the rarer species. I may illustrate what I
1228,"mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept, one adapted to an"
1228,"extensive mountainous region; a second to a comparatively narrow, hilly"
1228,tract; and a third to wide plains at the base; and that the inhabitants
1228,are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their stocks
1228,by selection; the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of the
1228,great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds
1228,"more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly"
1228,tract; and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon
1228,"take the place of the less improved hill breed; and thus the two breeds,"
1228,"which originally existed in greater numbers, will come into close"
1228,"contact with each other, without the interposition of the supplanted,"
1228,intermediate hill-variety.
1228,
1228,"To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined"
1228,"objects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of"
1228,"varying and intermediate links: firstly, because new varieties are"
1228,"very slowly formed, for variation is a very slow process, and natural"
1228,"selection can do nothing until favourable variations chance to occur,"
1228,and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be better
1228,filled by some modification of some one or more of its inhabitants.
1228,"And such new places will depend on slow changes of climate, or on the"
1228,"occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in a still"
1228,"more important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly"
1228,"modified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and"
1228,"reacting on each other. So that, in any one region and at any one time,"
1228,we ought only to see a few species presenting slight modifications of
1228,structure in some degree permanent; and this assuredly we do see.
1228,
1228,"Secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the"
1228,"recent period in isolated portions, in which many forms, more especially"
1228,"amongst the classes which unite for each birth and wander much, may have"
1228,separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative
1228,"species. In this case, intermediate varieties between the several"
1228,"representative species and their common parent, must formerly have"
1228,"existed in each broken portion of the land, but these links will"
1228,have been supplanted and exterminated during the process of natural
1228,"selection, so that they will no longer exist in a living state."
1228,
1228,"Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different"
1228,"portions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it"
1228,"is probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but"
1228,they will generally have had a short duration. For these intermediate
1228,"varieties will, from reasons already assigned (namely from what we know"
1228,"of the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species,"
1228,"and likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate zones"
1228,in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect. From
1228,this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental
1228,extermination; and during the process of further modification through
1228,"natural selection, they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted"
1228,by the forms which they connect; for these from existing in greater
1228,"numbers will, in the aggregate, present more variation, and thus be"
1228,further improved through natural selection and gain further advantages.
1228,
1228,"Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be"
1228,"true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all the"
1228,"species of the same group together, must assuredly have existed; but the"
1228,"very process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often"
1228,"remarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links."
1228,Consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only
1228,"amongst fossil remains, which are preserved, as we shall in a future"
1228,"chapter attempt to show, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent"
1228,record.
1228,
1228,ON THE ORIGIN AND TRANSITIONS OF ORGANIC BEINGS WITH PECULIAR HABITS AND
1228,STRUCTURE.
1228,
1228,"It has been asked by the opponents of such views as I hold, how, for"
1228,"instance, a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into one"
1228,with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its transitional state
1228,have subsisted? It would be easy to show that within the same group
1228,carnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade between
1228,truly aquatic and strictly terrestrial habits; and as each exists by a
1228,"struggle for life, it is clear that each is well adapted in its habits"
1228,"to its place in nature. Look at the Mustela vison of North America,"
1228,"which has webbed feet and which resembles an otter in its fur, short"
1228,"legs, and form of tail; during summer this animal dives for and preys on"
1228,"fish, but during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys"
1228,like other polecats on mice and land animals. If a different case had
1228,"been taken, and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could"
1228,"possibly have been converted into a flying bat, the question would have"
1228,"been far more difficult, and I could have given no answer. Yet I think"
1228,such difficulties have very little weight.
1228,
1228,"Here, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage, for out"
1228,"of the many striking cases which I have collected, I can give only one"
1228,or two instances of transitional habits and structures in closely allied
1228,"species of the same genus; and of diversified habits, either constant"
1228,"or occasional, in the same species. And it seems to me that nothing less"
1228,than a long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in
1228,any particular case like that of the bat.
1228,
1228,Look at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation from
1228,"animals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from others, as"
1228,"Sir J. Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies"
1228,"rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the"
1228,so-called flying squirrels; and flying squirrels have their limbs and
1228,"even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin, which"
1228,serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to
1228,an astonishing distance from tree to tree. We cannot doubt that each
1228,"structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country, by"
1228,"enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food more"
1228,"quickly, or, as there is reason to believe, by lessening the danger"
1228,from occasional falls. But it does not follow from this fact that the
1228,structure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive
1228,"under all natural conditions. Let the climate and vegetation change,"
1228,"let other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old ones"
1228,"become modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that some at"
1228,"least of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become exterminated,"
1228,unless they also became modified and improved in structure in a
1228,"corresponding manner. Therefore, I can see no difficulty, more"
1228,"especially under changing conditions of life, in the continued"
1228,"preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank-membranes,"
1228,"each modification being useful, each being propagated, until by the"
1228,"accumulated effects of this process of natural selection, a perfect"
1228,so-called flying squirrel was produced.
1228,
1228,"Now look at the Galeopithecus or flying lemur, which formerly was"
1228,"falsely ranked amongst bats. It has an extremely wide flank-membrane,"
1228,"stretching from the corners of the jaw to the tail, and including the"
1228,"limbs and the elongated fingers: the flank membrane is, also, furnished"
1228,"with an extensor muscle. Although no graduated links of structure,"
1228,"fitted for gliding through the air, now connect the Galeopithecus with"
1228,"the other Lemuridae, yet I can see no difficulty in supposing that such"
1228,"links formerly existed, and that each had been formed by the same steps"
1228,as in the case of the less perfectly gliding squirrels; and that each
1228,grade of structure had been useful to its possessor. Nor can I see
1228,any insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible that the
1228,membrane-connected fingers and fore-arm of the Galeopithecus might be
1228,"greatly lengthened by natural selection; and this, as far as the organs"
1228,"of flight are concerned, would convert it into a bat. In bats which have"
1228,the wing-membrane extended from the top of the shoulder to the
1228,"tail, including the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an apparatus"
1228,originally constructed for gliding through the air rather than for
1228,flight.
1228,
1228,"If about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown, who"
1228,would have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existed
1228,"which used their wings solely as flappers, like the logger-headed duck"
1228,"(Micropterus of Eyton); as fins in the water and front legs on the land,"
1228,"like the penguin; as sails, like the ostrich; and functionally for no"
1228,"purpose, like the Apteryx. Yet the structure of each of these birds is"
1228,"good for it, under the conditions of life to which it is exposed, for"
1228,each has to live by a struggle; but it is not necessarily the best
1228,possible under all possible conditions. It must not be inferred from
1228,"these remarks that any of the grades of wing-structure here alluded to,"
1228,"which perhaps may all have resulted from disuse, indicate the natural"
1228,steps by which birds have acquired their perfect power of flight; but
1228,"they serve, at least, to show what diversified means of transition are"
1228,possible.
1228,
1228,Seeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the
1228,"Crustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land, and seeing that"
1228,"we have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most diversified"
1228,"types, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable that"
1228,"flying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising and"
1228,"turning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been modified"
1228,"into perfectly winged animals. If this had been effected, who would"
1228,have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been
1228,"inhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their incipient organs of"
1228,"flight exclusively, as far as we know, to escape being devoured by other"
1228,fish?
1228,
1228,"When we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit,"
1228,"as the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals"
1228,displaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom
1228,"continue to exist to the present day, for they will have been"
1228,supplanted by the very process of perfection through natural selection.
1228,"Furthermore, we may conclude that transitional grades between structures"
1228,fitted for very different habits of life will rarely have been developed
1228,at an early period in great numbers and under many subordinate forms.
1228,"Thus, to return to our imaginary illustration of the flying-fish, it"
1228,does not seem probable that fishes capable of true flight would have
1228,"been developed under many subordinate forms, for taking prey of many"
1228,"kinds in many ways, on the land and in the water, until their organs of"
1228,"flight had come to a high stage of perfection, so as to have given them"
1228,a decided advantage over other animals in the battle for life. Hence the
1228,chance of discovering species with transitional grades of structure in
1228,"a fossil condition will always be less, from their having existed"
1228,"in lesser numbers, than in the case of species with fully developed"
1228,structures.
1228,
1228,I will now give two or three instances of diversified and of changed
1228,"habits in the individuals of the same species. When either case occurs,"
1228,"it would be easy for natural selection to fit the animal, by some"
1228,"modification of its structure, for its changed habits, or exclusively"
1228,"for one of its several different habits. But it is difficult to tell,"
1228,"and immaterial for us, whether habits generally change first and"
1228,structure afterwards; or whether slight modifications of structure lead
1228,to changed habits; both probably often change almost simultaneously. Of
1228,cases of changed habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the
1228,"many British insects which now feed on exotic plants, or exclusively on"
1228,artificial substances. Of diversified habits innumerable instances
1228,could be given: I have often watched a tyrant flycatcher (Saurophagus
1228,"sulphuratus) in South America, hovering over one spot and then"
1228,"proceeding to another, like a kestrel, and at other times standing"
1228,"stationary on the margin of water, and then dashing like a kingfisher at"
1228,a fish. In our own country the larger titmouse (Parus major) may be seen
1228,"climbing branches, almost like a creeper; it often, like a shrike, kills"
1228,small birds by blows on the head; and I have many times seen and heard
1228,"it hammering the seeds of the yew on a branch, and thus breaking them"
1228,like a nuthatch. In North America the black bear was seen by Hearne
1228,"swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, like a whale,"
1228,"insects in the water. Even in so extreme a case as this, if the supply"
1228,"of insects were constant, and if better adapted competitors did not"
1228,"already exist in the country, I can see no difficulty in a race of bears"
1228,"being rendered, by natural selection, more and more aquatic in their"
1228,"structure and habits, with larger and larger mouths, till a creature was"
1228,produced as monstrous as a whale.
1228,
1228,As we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits widely
1228,different from those both of their own species and of the other species
1228,"of the same genus, we might expect, on my theory, that such individuals"
1228,"would occasionally have given rise to new species, having anomalous"
1228,"habits, and with their structure either slightly or considerably"
1228,modified from that of their proper type. And such instances do occur in
1228,nature. Can a more striking instance of adaptation be given than that of
1228,a woodpecker for climbing trees and for seizing insects in the chinks of
1228,the bark? Yet in North America there are woodpeckers which feed largely
1228,"on fruit, and others with elongated wings which chase insects on the"
1228,"wing; and on the plains of La Plata, where not a tree grows, there is a"
1228,"woodpecker, which in every essential part of its organisation, even in"
1228,"its colouring, in the harsh tone of its voice, and undulatory flight,"
1228,told me plainly of its close blood-relationship to our common species;
1228,yet it is a woodpecker which never climbs a tree!
1228,
1228,"Petrels are the most aerial and oceanic of birds, yet in the quiet"
1228,"Sounds of Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria berardi, in its general"
1228,"habits, in its astonishing power of diving, its manner of swimming, and"
1228,"of flying when unwillingly it takes flight, would be mistaken by any one"
1228,"for an auk or grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially a petrel, but with"
1228,"many parts of its organisation profoundly modified. On the other hand,"
1228,the acutest observer by examining the dead body of the water-ouzel would
1228,never have suspected its sub-aquatic habits; yet this anomalous
1228,member of the strictly terrestrial thrush family wholly subsists by
1228,"diving,--grasping the stones with its feet and using its wings under"
1228,water.
1228,
1228,"He who believes that each being has been created as we now see it, must"
1228,occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having
1228,habits and structure not at all in agreement. What can be plainer than
1228,that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? yet
1228,there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near
1228,"the water; and no one except Audubon has seen the frigate-bird, which"
1228,"has all its four toes webbed, alight on the surface of the sea. On the"
1228,"other hand, grebes and coots are eminently aquatic, although their toes"
1228,are only bordered by membrane. What seems plainer than that the long
1228,toes of grallatores are formed for walking over swamps and floating
1228,"plants, yet the water-hen is nearly as aquatic as the coot; and the"
1228,landrail nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge. In such
1228,"cases, and many others could be given, habits have changed without a"
1228,corresponding change of structure. The webbed feet of the upland goose
1228,"may be said to have become rudimentary in function, though not in"
1228,"structure. In the frigate-bird, the deeply-scooped membrane between the"
1228,toes shows that structure has begun to change.
1228,
1228,"He who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will say,"
1228,that in these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being of one
1228,type to take the place of one of another type; but this seems to me
1228,only restating the fact in dignified language. He who believes in the
1228,"struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection, will"
1228,acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to
1228,"increase in numbers; and that if any one being vary ever so little,"
1228,"either in habits or structure, and thus gain an advantage over some"
1228,"other inhabitant of the country, it will seize on the place of that"
1228,"inhabitant, however different it may be from its own place. Hence it"
1228,will cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate-birds
1228,"with webbed feet, either living on the dry land or most rarely alighting"
1228,on the water; that there should be long-toed corncrakes living in
1228,meadows instead of in swamps; that there should be woodpeckers where not
1228,"a tree grows; that there should be diving thrushes, and petrels with the"
1228,habits of auks.
1228,
1228,ORGANS OF EXTREME PERFECTION AND COMPLICATION.
1228,
1228,"To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for"
1228,"adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different"
1228,"amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic"
1228,"aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely"
1228,"confess, absurd in the highest possible degree. Yet reason tells me,"
1228,that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very
1228,"imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be"
1228,"shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and"
1228,"the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any"
1228,variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under
1228,"changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a"
1228,"perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though"
1228,"insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real. How a"
1228,"nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how"
1228,life itself first originated; but I may remark that several facts make
1228,"me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light,"
1228,and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound.
1228,
1228,In looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has been
1228,"perfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors; but"
1228,"this is scarcely ever possible, and we are forced in each case to look"
1228,"to species of the same group, that is to the collateral descendants"
1228,"from the same original parent-form, in order to see what gradations are"
1228,"possible, and for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted"
1228,"from the earlier stages of descent, in an unaltered or little altered"
1228,"condition. Amongst existing Vertebrata, we find but a small amount of"
1228,"gradation in the structure of the eye, and from fossil species we can"
1228,learn nothing on this head. In this great class we should probably
1228,have to descend far beneath the lowest known fossiliferous stratum to
1228,"discover the earlier stages, by which the eye has been perfected."
1228,
1228,In the Articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merely
1228,"coated with pigment, and without any other mechanism; and from this"
1228,"low stage, numerous gradations of structure, branching off in two"
1228,"fundamentally different lines, can be shown to exist, until we reach"
1228,"a moderately high stage of perfection. In certain crustaceans, for"
1228,"instance, there is a double cornea, the inner one divided into"
1228,"facets, within each of which there is a lens-shaped swelling. In other"
1228,"crustaceans the transparent cones which are coated by pigment, and which"
1228,"properly act only by excluding lateral pencils of light, are convex at"
1228,their upper ends and must act by convergence; and at their lower ends
1228,"there seems to be an imperfect vitreous substance. With these facts,"
1228,"here far too briefly and imperfectly given, which show that there is"
1228,"much graduated diversity in the eyes of living crustaceans, and bearing"
1228,in mind how small the number of living animals is in proportion to those
1228,"which have become extinct, I can see no very great difficulty (not more"
1228,than in the case of many other structures) in believing that natural
1228,selection has converted the simple apparatus of an optic nerve merely
1228,"coated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane, into an"
1228,optical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the great
1228,Articulate class.
1228,
1228,"He who will go thus far, if he find on finishing this treatise that"
1228,"large bodies of facts, otherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the"
1228,"theory of descent, ought not to hesitate to go further, and to admit"
1228,that a structure even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed
1228,"by natural selection, although in this case he does not know any of the"
1228,transitional grades. His reason ought to conquer his imagination; though
1228,I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree
1228,of hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to such
1228,startling lengths.
1228,
1228,It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope.
1228,We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued
1228,efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the
1228,eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this
1228,inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator
1228,works by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must compare the
1228,"eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick"
1228,"layer of transparent tissue, with a nerve sensitive to light beneath,"
1228,and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changing
1228,"slowly in density, so as to separate into layers of different densities"
1228,"and thicknesses, placed at different distances from each other, and"
1228,with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form. Further we
1228,must suppose that there is a power always intently watching each slight
1228,accidental alteration in the transparent layers; and carefully selecting
1228,"each alteration which, under varied circumstances, may in any way, or in"
1228,"any degree, tend to produce a distincter image. We must suppose each new"
1228,state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; and each to
1228,"be preserved till a better be produced, and then the old ones to"
1228,"be destroyed. In living bodies, variation will cause the slight"
1228,"alterations, generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and"
1228,natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement.
1228,Let this process go on for millions on millions of years; and during
1228,each year on millions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not
1228,believe that a living optical instrument might thus be formed as
1228,"superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to those of"
1228,man?
1228,
1228,"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which"
1228,"could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight"
1228,"modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find"
1228,out no such case. No doubt many organs exist of which we do not know
1228,"the transitional grades, more especially if we look to much-isolated"
1228,"species, round which, according to my theory, there has been much"
1228,"extinction. Or again, if we look to an organ common to all the members"
1228,"of a large class, for in this latter case the organ must have been first"
1228,"formed at an extremely remote period, since which all the many members"
1228,of the class have been developed; and in order to discover the early
1228,"transitional grades through which the organ has passed, we should have"
1228,"to look to very ancient ancestral forms, long since become extinct."
1228,
1228,We should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not
1228,have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind. Numerous cases
1228,could be given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing
1228,at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus the alimentary canal
1228,"respires, digests, and excretes in the larva of the dragon-fly and in"
1228,"the fish Cobites. In the Hydra, the animal may be turned inside out, and"
1228,the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire. In such
1228,"cases natural selection might easily specialise, if any advantage were"
1228,"thus gained, a part or organ, which had performed two functions, for one"
1228,"function alone, and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps."
1228,Two distinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same function
1228,"in the same individual; to give one instance, there are fish with gills"
1228,"or branchiae that breathe the air dissolved in the water, at the same"
1228,"time that they breathe free air in their swimbladders, this latter organ"
1228,"having a ductus pneumaticus for its supply, and being divided by highly"
1228,"vascular partitions. In these cases, one of the two organs might with"
1228,"ease be modified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself,"
1228,being aided during the process of modification by the other organ;
1228,and then this other organ might be modified for some other and quite
1228,"distinct purpose, or be quite obliterated."
1228,
1228,"The illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one, because"
1228,it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally
1228,"constructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into one"
1228,"for a wholly different purpose, namely respiration. The swimbladder has,"
1228,"also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain"
1228,"fish, or, for I do not know which view is now generally held, a part"
1228,of the auditory apparatus has been worked in as a complement to the
1228,"swimbladder. All physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous,"
1228,"or ""ideally similar,"" in position and structure with the lungs of"
1228,the higher vertebrate animals: hence there seems to me to be no great
1228,difficulty in believing that natural selection has actually converted a
1228,"swimbladder into a lung, or organ used exclusively for respiration."
1228,
1228,"I can, indeed, hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true"
1228,"lungs have descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype,"
1228,"of which we know nothing, furnished with a floating apparatus or"
1228,"swimbladder. We can thus, as I infer from Professor Owen's interesting"
1228,"description of these parts, understand the strange fact that every"
1228,particle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the
1228,"orifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the lungs,"
1228,notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis
1228,is closed. In the higher Vertebrata the branchiae have wholly
1228,disappeared--the slits on the sides of the neck and the loop-like course
1228,of the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position. But
1228,it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiae might have
1228,been gradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinct
1228,"purpose: in the same manner as, on the view entertained by some"
1228,naturalists that the branchiae and dorsal scales of Annelids are
1228,"homologous with the wings and wing-covers of insects, it is probable"
1228,that organs which at a very ancient period served for respiration have
1228,been actually converted into organs of flight.
1228,
1228,"In considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in mind"
1228,"the probability of conversion from one function to another, that I will"
1228,give one more instance. Pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of
1228,"skin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve, through the means"
1228,"of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they are hatched within"
1228,"the sack. These cirripedes have no branchiae, the whole surface of the"
1228,"body and sack, including the small frena, serving for respiration. The"
1228,"Balanidae or sessile cirripedes, on the other hand, have no ovigerous"
1228,"frena, the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack, in the"
1228,well-enclosed shell; but they have large folded branchiae. Now I think
1228,no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family are
1228,"strictly homologous with the branchiae of the other family; indeed, they"
1228,graduate into each other. Therefore I do not doubt that little folds of
1228,"skin, which originally served as ovigerous frena, but which, likewise,"
1228,"very slightly aided the act of respiration, have been gradually"
1228,"converted by natural selection into branchiae, simply through an"
1228,increase in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive glands.
1228,"If all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct, and they have already"
1228,"suffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes, who would"
1228,ever have imagined that the branchiae in this latter family had
1228,originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed
1228,out of the sack?
1228,
1228,Although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ
1228,could not possibly have been produced by successive transitional
1228,"gradations, yet, undoubtedly, grave cases of difficulty occur, some of"
1228,which will be discussed in my future work.
1228,
1228,"One of the gravest is that of neuter insects, which are often very"
1228,differently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but
1228,this case will be treated of in the next chapter. The electric organs
1228,of fishes offer another case of special difficulty; it is impossible to
1228,"conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced; but,"
1228,"as Owen and others have remarked, their intimate structure closely"
1228,resembles that of common muscle; and as it has lately been shown that
1228,"Rays have an organ closely analogous to the electric apparatus, and yet"
1228,"do not, as Matteuchi asserts, discharge any electricity, we must own"
1228,that we are far too ignorant to argue that no transition of any kind is
1228,possible.
1228,
1228,The electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty; for
1228,"they occur in only about a dozen fishes, of which several are widely"
1228,remote in their affinities. Generally when the same organ appears in
1228,"several members of the same class, especially if in members having very"
1228,"different habits of life, we may attribute its presence to inheritance"
1228,from a common ancestor; and its absence in some of the members to its
1228,loss through disuse or natural selection. But if the electric organs had
1228,"been inherited from one ancient progenitor thus provided, we might have"
1228,expected that all electric fishes would have been specially related to
1228,each other. Nor does geology at all lead to the belief that formerly
1228,"most fishes had electric organs, which most of their modified"
1228,"descendants have lost. The presence of luminous organs in a few insects,"
1228,"belonging to different families and orders, offers a parallel case of"
1228,"difficulty. Other cases could be given; for instance in plants, the very"
1228,"curious contrivance of a mass of pollen-grains, borne on a"
1228,"foot-stalk with a sticky gland at the end, is the same in Orchis and"
1228,"Asclepias,--genera almost as remote as possible amongst flowering"
1228,plants. In all these cases of two very distinct species furnished
1228,"with apparently the same anomalous organ, it should be observed that,"
1228,although the general appearance and function of the organ may be the
1228,"same, yet some fundamental difference can generally be detected. I"
1228,am inclined to believe that in nearly the same way as two men have
1228,"sometimes independently hit on the very same invention, so natural"
1228,"selection, working for the good of each being and taking advantage of"
1228,"analogous variations, has sometimes modified in very nearly the same"
1228,"manner two parts in two organic beings, which owe but little of their"
1228,structure in common to inheritance from the same ancestor.
1228,
1228,Although in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by what
1228,"transitions an organ could have arrived at its present state; yet,"
1228,considering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinct
1228,"and unknown is very small, I have been astonished how rarely an organ"
1228,"can be named, towards which no transitional grade is known to lead."
1228,The truth of this remark is indeed shown by that old canon in natural
1228,"history of ""Natura non facit saltum."" We meet with this admission in the"
1228,"writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as Milne Edwards"
1228,"has well expressed it, nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in"
1228,"innovation. Why, on the theory of Creation, should this be so? Why"
1228,"should all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each"
1228,"supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature,"
1228,be so invariably linked together by graduated steps? Why should not
1228,Nature have taken a leap from structure to structure? On the theory of
1228,"natural selection, we can clearly understand why she should not; for"
1228,natural selection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive
1228,"variations; she can never take a leap, but must advance by the shortest"
1228,and slowest steps.
1228,
1228,ORGANS OF LITTLE APPARENT IMPORTANCE.
1228,
1228,"As natural selection acts by life and death,--by the preservation of"
1228,"individuals with any favourable variation, and by the destruction of"
1228,"those with any unfavourable deviation of structure,--I have sometimes"
1228,"felt much difficulty in understanding the origin of simple parts, of"
1228,which the importance does not seem sufficient to cause the preservation
1228,of successively varying individuals. I have sometimes felt as much
1228,"difficulty, though of a very different kind, on this head, as in the"
1228,case of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye.
1228,
1228,"In the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole"
1228,"economy of any one organic being, to say what slight modifications would"
1228,be of importance or not. In a former chapter I have given instances of
1228,"most trifling characters, such as the down on fruit and the colour of"
1228,"the flesh, which, from determining the attacks of insects or from being"
1228,"correlated with constitutional differences, might assuredly be acted on"
1228,by natural selection. The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially
1228,constructed fly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this
1228,could have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight
1228,"modifications, each better and better, for so trifling an object as"
1228,driving away flies; yet we should pause before being too positive even
1228,"in this case, for we know that the distribution and existence of cattle"
1228,and other animals in South America absolutely depends on their power of
1228,resisting the attacks of insects: so that individuals which could by any
1228,"means defend themselves from these small enemies, would be able to range"
1228,into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage. It is not that the
1228,larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed (except in some rare cases) by
1228,"the flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced,"
1228,"so that they are more subject to disease, or not so well enabled in a"
1228,"coming dearth to search for food, or to escape from beasts of prey."
1228,
1228,Organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of
1228,"high importance to an early progenitor, and, after having been slowly"
1228,"perfected at a former period, have been transmitted in nearly the"
1228,"same state, although now become of very slight use; and any actually"
1228,injurious deviations in their structure will always have been checked by
1228,natural selection. Seeing how important an organ of locomotion the
1228,"tail is in most aquatic animals, its general presence and use for many"
1228,"purposes in so many land animals, which in their lungs or modified"
1228,"swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be thus accounted"
1228,"for. A well-developed tail having been formed in an aquatic animal, it"
1228,"might subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of purposes, as"
1228,"a fly-flapper, an organ of prehension, or as an aid in turning, as with"
1228,"the dog, though the aid must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any"
1228,"tail, can double quickly enough."
1228,
1228,"In the second place, we may sometimes attribute importance to characters"
1228,"which are really of very little importance, and which have originated"
1228,"from quite secondary causes, independently of natural selection. We"
1228,"should remember that climate, food, etc., probably have some little"
1228,direct influence on the organisation; that characters reappear from
1228,the law of reversion; that correlation of growth will have had a most
1228,"important influence in modifying various structures; and finally,"
1228,that sexual selection will often have largely modified the external
1228,"characters of animals having a will, to give one male an advantage"
1228,in fighting with another or in charming the females. Moreover when a
1228,modification of structure has primarily arisen from the above or
1228,"other unknown causes, it may at first have been of no advantage to"
1228,"the species, but may subsequently have been taken advantage of by the"
1228,descendants of the species under new conditions of life and with newly
1228,acquired habits.
1228,
1228,To give a few instances to illustrate these latter remarks. If green
1228,"woodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there were many"
1228,"black and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have thought that the"
1228,green colour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this tree-frequenting
1228,bird from its enemies; and consequently that it was a character of
1228,importance and might have been acquired through natural selection; as it
1228,"is, I have no doubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause,"
1228,probably to sexual selection. A trailing bamboo in the Malay Archipelago
1228,climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks
1228,"clustered around the ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no"
1228,"doubt, is of the highest service to the plant; but as we see nearly"
1228,"similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers, the hooks on the"
1228,"bamboo may have arisen from unknown laws of growth, and have been"
1228,subsequently taken advantage of by the plant undergoing further
1228,modification and becoming a climber. The naked skin on the head of a
1228,vulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation for wallowing in
1228,"putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due to the direct"
1228,action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in drawing
1228,"any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the"
1228,clean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked. The sutures in the skulls
1228,of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding
1228,"parturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable"
1228,for this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and
1228,"reptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that"
1228,"this structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken"
1228,advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals.
1228,
1228,We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and
1228,unimportant variations; and we are immediately made conscious of this by
1228,reflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals
1228,"in different countries,--more especially in the less civilized countries"
1228,where there has been but little artificial selection. Careful observers
1228,"are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair, and"
1228,that with the hair the horns are correlated. Mountain breeds always
1228,differ from lowland breeds; and a mountainous country would probably
1228,"affect the hind limbs from exercising them more, and possibly even the"
1228,"form of the pelvis; and then by the law of homologous variation, the"
1228,"front limbs and even the head would probably be affected. The shape,"
1228,"also, of the pelvis might affect by pressure the shape of the head of"
1228,the young in the womb. The laborious breathing necessary in high regions
1228,"would, we have some reason to believe, increase the size of the chest;"
1228,and again correlation would come into play. Animals kept by savages in
1228,"different countries often have to struggle for their own subsistence,"
1228,"and would be exposed to a certain extent to natural selection, and"
1228,individuals with slightly different constitutions would succeed
1228,best under different climates; and there is reason to believe that
1228,"constitution and colour are correlated. A good observer, also, states"
1228,that in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of flies is correlated with
1228,"colour, as is the liability to be poisoned by certain plants; so that"
1228,colour would be thus subjected to the action of natural selection. But
1228,we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the
1228,several known and unknown laws of variation; and I have here alluded
1228,"to them only to show that, if we are unable to account for the"
1228,"characteristic differences of our domestic breeds, which nevertheless we"
1228,"generally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation, we ought"
1228,not to lay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause of the
1228,slight analogous differences between species. I might have adduced for
1228,"this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are"
1228,so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently
1228,"be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual"
1228,"selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious"
1228,details my reasoning would appear frivolous.
1228,
1228,The foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately
1228,"made by some naturalists, against the utilitarian doctrine that every"
1228,detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor.
1228,They believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in
1228,"the eyes of man, or for mere variety. This doctrine, if true, would be"
1228,absolutely fatal to my theory. Yet I fully admit that many structures
1228,are of no direct use to their possessors. Physical conditions probably
1228,"have had some little effect on structure, quite independently of any"
1228,good thus gained. Correlation of growth has no doubt played a most
1228,"important part, and a useful modification of one part will often have"
1228,entailed on other parts diversified changes of no direct use. So again
1228,"characters which formerly were useful, or which formerly had arisen from"
1228,"correlation of growth, or from other unknown cause, may reappear from"
1228,"the law of reversion, though now of no direct use. The effects of sexual"
1228,"selection, when displayed in beauty to charm the females, can be called"
1228,useful only in rather a forced sense. But by far the most important
1228,consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of every
1228,"being is simply due to inheritance; and consequently, though each being"
1228,"assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures now"
1228,"have no direct relation to the habits of life of each species. Thus, we"
1228,can hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose or of the
1228,frigate-bird are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe that
1228,"the same bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of the horse,"
1228,"in the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal, are of special"
1228,use to these animals. We may safely attribute these structures to
1228,inheritance. But to the progenitor of the upland goose and of the
1228,"frigate-bird, webbed feet no doubt were as useful as they now are to the"
1228,most aquatic of existing birds. So we may believe that the progenitor of
1228,"the seal had not a flipper, but a foot with five toes fitted for walking"
1228,or grasping; and we may further venture to believe that the several
1228,"bones in the limbs of the monkey, horse, and bat, which have been"
1228,"inherited from a common progenitor, were formerly of more special use to"
1228,"that progenitor, or its progenitors, than they now are to these animals"
1228,having such widely diversified habits. Therefore we may infer that
1228,"these several bones might have been acquired through natural selection,"
1228,"subjected formerly, as now, to the several laws of inheritance,"
1228,"reversion, correlation of growth, etc. Hence every detail of structure"
1228,in every living creature (making some little allowance for the direct
1228,"action of physical conditions) may be viewed, either as having been of"
1228,"special use to some ancestral form, or as being now of special use to"
1228,"the descendants of this form--either directly, or indirectly through the"
1228,complex laws of growth.
1228,
1228,Natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any one
1228,species exclusively for the good of another species; though throughout
1228,"nature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by, the"
1228,structure of another. But natural selection can and does often produce
1228,"structures for the direct injury of other species, as we see in the fang"
1228,"of the adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its eggs"
1228,are deposited in the living bodies of other insects. If it could be
1228,proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been
1228,"formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my"
1228,"theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection."
1228,Although many statements may be found in works on natural history to
1228,"this effect, I cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight. It"
1228,is admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence
1228,and for the destruction of its prey; but some authors suppose that at
1228,"the same time this snake is furnished with a rattle for its own injury,"
1228,"namely, to warn its prey to escape. I would almost as soon believe that"
1228,"the cat curls the end of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to"
1228,warn the doomed mouse. But I have not space here to enter on this and
1228,other such cases.
1228,
1228,Natural selection will never produce in a being anything injurious to
1228,"itself, for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each."
1228,"No organ will be formed, as Paley has remarked, for the purpose of"
1228,causing pain or for doing an injury to its possessor. If a fair balance
1228,"be struck between the good and evil caused by each part, each will be"
1228,"found on the whole advantageous. After the lapse of time, under changing"
1228,"conditions of life, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be"
1228,"modified; or if it be not so, the being will become extinct, as myriads"
1228,have become extinct.
1228,
1228,"Natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as,"
1228,"or slightly more perfect than, the other inhabitants of the same country"
1228,with which it has to struggle for existence. And we see that this is the
1228,degree of perfection attained under nature. The endemic productions of
1228,"New Zealand, for instance, are perfect one compared with another; but"
1228,they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants
1228,and animals introduced from Europe. Natural selection will not produce
1228,"absolute perfection, nor do we always meet, as far as we can judge, with"
1228,this high standard under nature. The correction for the aberration of
1228,"light is said, on high authority, not to be perfect even in that most"
1228,"perfect organ, the eye. If our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm"
1228,"a multitude of inimitable contrivances in nature, this same reason tells"
1228,"us, though we may easily err on both sides, that some other contrivances"
1228,are less perfect. Can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee
1228,"as perfect, which, when used against many attacking animals, cannot be"
1228,"withdrawn, owing to the backward serratures, and so inevitably causes"
1228,the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera?
1228,
1228,"If we look at the sting of the bee, as having originally existed in a"
1228,"remote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so"
1228,"many members of the same great order, and which has been modified"
1228,"but not perfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally"
1228,"adapted to cause galls subsequently intensified, we can perhaps"
1228,understand how it is that the use of the sting should so often cause the
1228,insect's own death: for if on the whole the power of stinging be
1228,"useful to the community, it will fulfil all the requirements of natural"
1228,"selection, though it may cause the death of some few members. If we"
1228,admire the truly wonderful power of scent by which the males of many
1228,"insects find their females, can we admire the production for this"
1228,"single purpose of thousands of drones, which are utterly useless to the"
1228,"community for any other end, and which are ultimately slaughtered by"
1228,"their industrious and sterile sisters? It may be difficult, but we ought"
1228,"to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the queen-bee, which urges"
1228,"her instantly to destroy the young queens her daughters as soon as born,"
1228,or to perish herself in the combat; for undoubtedly this is for the
1228,"good of the community; and maternal love or maternal hatred, though"
1228,"the latter fortunately is most rare, is all the same to the inexorable"
1228,principle of natural selection. If we admire the several ingenious
1228,"contrivances, by which the flowers of the orchis and of many other"
1228,"plants are fertilised through insect agency, can we consider as equally"
1228,"perfect the elaboration by our fir-trees of dense clouds of pollen, in"
1228,order that a few granules may be wafted by a chance breeze on to the
1228,ovules?
1228,
1228,SUMMARY OF CHAPTER.
1228,
1228,We have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and
1228,objections which may be urged against my theory. Many of them are very
1228,grave; but I think that in the discussion light has been thrown on
1228,"several facts, which on the theory of independent acts of creation are"
1228,utterly obscure. We have seen that species at any one period are not
1228,"indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of"
1228,"intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection"
1228,"will always be very slow, and will act, at any one time, only on a very"
1228,few forms; and partly because the very process of natural selection
1228,almost implies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding
1228,"and intermediate gradations. Closely allied species, now living on"
1228,"a continuous area, must often have been formed when the area was not"
1228,"continuous, and when the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate"
1228,away from one part to another. When two varieties are formed in two
1228,"districts of a continuous area, an intermediate variety will often be"
1228,"formed, fitted for an intermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the"
1228,intermediate variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two
1228,"forms which it connects; consequently the two latter, during the course"
1228,"of further modification, from existing in greater numbers, will have a"
1228,"great advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety, and will"
1228,thus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it.
1228,
1228,We have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding
1228,that the most different habits of life could not graduate into each
1228,"other; that a bat, for instance, could not have been formed by natural"
1228,selection from an animal which at first could only glide through the
1228,air.
1228,
1228,We have seen that a species may under new conditions of life change its
1228,"habits, or have diversified habits, with some habits very unlike those"
1228,"of its nearest congeners. Hence we can understand, bearing in mind that"
1228,"each organic being is trying to live wherever it can live, how it has"
1228,"arisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground woodpeckers,"
1228,"diving thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks."
1228,
1228,Although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been
1228,"formed by natural selection, is more than enough to stagger any one; yet"
1228,"in the case of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in"
1228,"complexity, each good for its possessor, then, under changing conditions"
1228,"of life, there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any"
1228,conceivable degree of perfection through natural selection. In the cases
1228,"in which we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we should"
1228,"be very cautious in concluding that none could have existed, for the"
1228,homologies of many organs and their intermediate states show that
1228,"wonderful metamorphoses in function are at least possible. For instance,"
1228,a swim-bladder has apparently been converted into an air-breathing lung.
1228,"The same organ having performed simultaneously very different functions,"
1228,and then having been specialised for one function; and two very distinct
1228,"organs having performed at the same time the same function, the one"
1228,"having been perfected whilst aided by the other, must often have largely"
1228,facilitated transitions.
1228,
1228,"We are far too ignorant, in almost every case, to be enabled to assert"
1228,"that any part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species,"
1228,that modifications in its structure could not have been slowly
1228,accumulated by means of natural selection. But we may confidently
1228,"believe that many modifications, wholly due to the laws of growth, and"
1228,"at first in no way advantageous to a species, have been subsequently"
1228,taken advantage of by the still further modified descendants of this
1228,"species. We may, also, believe that a part formerly of high importance"
1228,has often been retained (as the tail of an aquatic animal by its
1228,"terrestrial descendants), though it has become of such small importance"
1228,"that it could not, in its present state, have been acquired by natural"
1228,"selection,--a power which acts solely by the preservation of profitable"
1228,variations in the struggle for life.
1228,
1228,Natural selection will produce nothing in one species for the exclusive
1228,"good or injury of another; though it may well produce parts, organs, and"
1228,"excretions highly useful or even indispensable, or highly injurious to"
1228,"another species, but in all cases at the same time useful to the owner."
1228,"Natural selection in each well-stocked country, must act chiefly through"
1228,"the competition of the inhabitants one with another, and consequently"
1228,"will produce perfection, or strength in the battle for life, only"
1228,according to the standard of that country. Hence the inhabitants of one
1228,"country, generally the smaller one, will often yield, as we see they do"
1228,"yield, to the inhabitants of another and generally larger country. For"
1228,"in the larger country there will have existed more individuals, and more"
1228,"diversified forms, and the competition will have been severer, and"
1228,thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher. Natural
1228,"selection will not necessarily produce absolute perfection; nor, as far"
1228,"as we can judge by our limited faculties, can absolute perfection be"
1228,everywhere found.
1228,
1228,On the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full
1228,"meaning of that old canon in natural history, ""Natura non facit saltum."""
1228,"This canon, if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world, is"
1228,"not strictly correct, but if we include all those of past times, it must"
1228,by my theory be strictly true.
1228,
1228,It is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on
1228,"two great laws--Unity of Type, and the Conditions of Existence. By unity"
1228,"of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure, which we see"
1228,"in organic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of"
1228,"their habits of life. On my theory, unity of type is explained by unity"
1228,"of descent. The expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted"
1228,"on by the illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of"
1228,natural selection. For natural selection acts by either now adapting the
1228,varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of
1228,life; or by having adapted them during long-past periods of time: the
1228,"adaptations being aided in some cases by use and disuse, being slightly"
1228,"affected by the direct action of the external conditions of life, and"
1228,"being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth. Hence, in"
1228,"fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the higher law; as it"
1228,"includes, through the inheritance of former adaptations, that of Unity"
1228,of Type.
1228,

1228,. INSTINCT.
1228,
1228,"Instincts comparable with habits, but different in their origin."
1228,Instincts graduated. Aphides and ants. Instincts variable. Domestic
1228,"instincts, their origin. Natural instincts of the cuckoo, ostrich, and"
1228,"parasitic bees. Slave-making ants. Hive-bee, its cell-making instinct."
1228,Difficulties on the theory of the Natural Selection of instincts. Neuter
1228,or sterile insects. Summary.
1228,
1228,The subject of instinct might have been worked into the previous
1228,chapters; but I have thought that it would be more convenient to treat
1228,"the subject separately, especially as so wonderful an instinct as that"
1228,of the hive-bee making its cells will probably have occurred to many
1228,"readers, as a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory. I must"
1228,"premise, that I have nothing to do with the origin of the primary mental"
1228,"powers, any more than I have with that of life itself. We are concerned"
1228,only with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental qualities
1228,of animals within the same class.
1228,
1228,I will not attempt any definition of instinct. It would be easy to show
1228,that several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term;
1228,"but every one understands what is meant, when it is said that instinct"
1228,impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds' nests.
1228,"An action, which we ourselves should require experience to enable us to"
1228,"perform, when performed by an animal, more especially by a very young"
1228,"one, without any experience, and when performed by many individuals in"
1228,"the same way, without their knowing for what purpose it is performed,"
1228,is usually said to be instinctive. But I could show that none of these
1228,"characters of instinct are universal. A little dose, as Pierre Huber"
1228,"expresses it, of judgment or reason, often comes into play, even in"
1228,animals very low in the scale of nature.
1228,
1228,Frederick Cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared
1228,"instinct with habit. This comparison gives, I think, a remarkably"
1228,accurate notion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action
1228,"is performed, but not of its origin. How unconsciously many habitual"
1228,"actions are performed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our"
1228,conscious will! yet they may be modified by the will or reason. Habits
1228,"easily become associated with other habits, and with certain periods"
1228,"of time and states of the body. When once acquired, they often remain"
1228,constant throughout life. Several other points of resemblance between
1228,instincts and habits could be pointed out. As in repeating a well-known
1228,"song, so in instincts, one action follows another by a sort of rhythm;"
1228,"if a person be interrupted in a song, or in repeating anything by rote,"
1228,he is generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of
1228,"thought: so P. Huber found it was with a caterpillar, which makes a very"
1228,complicated hammock; for if he took a caterpillar which had completed
1228,"its hammock up to, say, the sixth stage of construction, and put it into"
1228,"a hammock completed up only to the third stage, the caterpillar simply"
1228,"re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of construction."
1228,"If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for"
1228,"instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the"
1228,"sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from"
1228,"feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to"
1228,"complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage, where"
1228,"it had left off, and thus tried to complete the already finished work."
1228,
1228,If we suppose any habitual action to become inherited--and I think
1228,it can be shown that this does sometimes happen--then the resemblance
1228,between what originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as
1228,"not to be distinguished. If Mozart, instead of playing the pianoforte at"
1228,"three years old with wonderfully little practice, had played a tune"
1228,"with no practice at all, he might truly be said to have done so"
1228,instinctively. But it would be the most serious error to suppose that
1228,the greater number of instincts have been acquired by habit in
1228,"one generation, and then transmitted by inheritance to succeeding"
1228,generations. It can be clearly shown that the most wonderful instincts
1228,"with which we are acquainted, namely, those of the hive-bee and of many"
1228,"ants, could not possibly have been thus acquired."
1228,
1228,It will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as
1228,"corporeal structure for the welfare of each species, under its present"
1228,"conditions of life. Under changed conditions of life, it is at least"
1228,possible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a
1228,"species; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little,"
1228,then I can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and
1228,continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that may
1228,"be profitable. It is thus, as I believe, that all the most complex"
1228,and wonderful instincts have originated. As modifications of corporeal
1228,"structure arise from, and are increased by, use or habit, and are"
1228,"diminished or lost by disuse, so I do not doubt it has been with"
1228,instincts. But I believe that the effects of habit are of quite
1228,subordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of what
1228,may be called accidental variations of instincts;--that is of variations
1228,produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight deviations of
1228,bodily structure.
1228,
1228,"No complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural selection,"
1228,"except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous, slight, yet"
1228,"profitable, variations. Hence, as in the case of corporeal structures,"
1228,"we ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by"
1228,which each complex instinct has been acquired--for these could be found
1228,only in the lineal ancestors of each species--but we ought to find in
1228,the collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations; or
1228,we ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are
1228,"possible; and this we certainly can do. I have been surprised to find,"
1228,making allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little
1228,"observed except in Europe and North America, and for no instinct being"
1228,"known amongst extinct species, how very generally gradations, leading to"
1228,"the most complex instincts, can be discovered. The canon of ""Natura non"
1228,"facit saltum"" applies with almost equal force to instincts as to bodily"
1228,organs. Changes of instinct may sometimes be facilitated by the same
1228,"species having different instincts at different periods of life, or"
1228,"at different seasons of the year, or when placed under different"
1228,"circumstances, etc.; in which case either one or the other instinct"
1228,might be preserved by natural selection. And such instances of diversity
1228,of instinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature.
1228,
1228,"Again as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably with my"
1228,"theory, the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has never,"
1228,"as far as we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good of others."
1228,One of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an
1228,"action for the sole good of another, with which I am acquainted, is that"
1228,of aphides voluntarily yielding their sweet excretion to ants: that they
1228,"do so voluntarily, the following facts show. I removed all the ants from"
1228,"a group of about a dozen aphides on a dock-plant, and prevented their"
1228,"attendance during several hours. After this interval, I felt sure that"
1228,the aphides would want to excrete. I watched them for some time through
1228,"a lens, but not one excreted; I then tickled and stroked them with a"
1228,"hair in the same manner, as well as I could, as the ants do with their"
1228,antennae; but not one excreted. Afterwards I allowed an ant to visit
1228,"them, and it immediately seemed, by its eager way of running about, to"
1228,be well aware what a rich flock it had discovered; it then began to play
1228,with its antennae on the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another;
1228,"and each aphis, as soon as it felt the antennae, immediately lifted up"
1228,"its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice, which was eagerly"
1228,devoured by the ant. Even the quite young aphides behaved in this
1228,"manner, showing that the action was instinctive, and not the result of"
1228,"experience. But as the excretion is extremely viscid, it is probably a"
1228,convenience to the aphides to have it removed; and therefore probably
1228,the aphides do not instinctively excrete for the sole good of the ants.
1228,Although I do not believe that any animal in the world performs an
1228,"action for the exclusive good of another of a distinct species, yet"
1228,"each species tries to take advantage of the instincts of others, as each"
1228,"takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of others. So again, in"
1228,"some few cases, certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutely"
1228,perfect; but as details on this and other such points are not
1228,"indispensable, they may be here passed over."
1228,
1228,"As some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature, and"
1228,"the inheritance of such variations, are indispensable for the action of"
1228,"natural selection, as many instances as possible ought to have been here"
1228,"given; but want of space prevents me. I can only assert, that instincts"
1228,"certainly do vary--for instance, the migratory instinct, both in extent"
1228,"and direction, and in its total loss. So it is with the nests of birds,"
1228,"which vary partly in dependence on the situations chosen, and on the"
1228,"nature and temperature of the country inhabited, but often from causes"
1228,wholly unknown to us: Audubon has given several remarkable cases of
1228,differences in nests of the same species in the northern and southern
1228,United States. Fear of any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive
1228,"quality, as may be seen in nestling birds, though it is strengthened by"
1228,"experience, and by the sight of fear of the same enemy in other animals."
1228,"But fear of man is slowly acquired, as I have elsewhere shown, by"
1228,various animals inhabiting desert islands; and we may see an instance
1228,"of this, even in England, in the greater wildness of all our large birds"
1228,than of our small birds; for the large birds have been most persecuted
1228,by man. We may safely attribute the greater wildness of our large birds
1228,to this cause; for in uninhabited islands large birds are not more
1228,"fearful than small; and the magpie, so wary in England, is tame in"
1228,"Norway, as is the hooded crow in Egypt."
1228,
1228,"That the general disposition of individuals of the same species, born in"
1228,"a state of nature, is extremely diversified, can be shown by a multitude"
1228,"of facts. Several cases also, could be given, of occasional and strange"
1228,"habits in certain species, which might, if advantageous to the species,"
1228,"give rise, through natural selection, to quite new instincts. But I am"
1228,"well aware that these general statements, without facts given in detail,"
1228,can produce but a feeble effect on the reader's mind. I can only repeat
1228,"my assurance, that I do not speak without good evidence."
1228,
1228,"The possibility, or even probability, of inherited variations"
1228,of instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly
1228,considering a few cases under domestication. We shall thus also be
1228,enabled to see the respective parts which habit and the selection of
1228,so-called accidental variations have played in modifying the mental
1228,qualities of our domestic animals. A number of curious and authentic
1228,instances could be given of the inheritance of all shades of disposition
1228,"and tastes, and likewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain"
1228,frames of mind or periods of time. But let us look to the familiar case
1228,of the several breeds of dogs: it cannot be doubted that young pointers
1228,(I have myself seen a striking instance) will sometimes point and even
1228,back other dogs the very first time that they are taken out; retrieving
1228,is certainly in some degree inherited by retrievers; and a tendency to
1228,"run round, instead of at, a flock of sheep, by shepherd-dogs. I cannot"
1228,"see that these actions, performed without experience by the young,"
1228,"and in nearly the same manner by each individual, performed with eager"
1228,"delight by each breed, and without the end being known,--for the young"
1228,"pointer can no more know that he points to aid his master, than"
1228,the white butterfly knows why she lays her eggs on the leaf of the
1228,"cabbage,--I cannot see that these actions differ essentially from true"
1228,"instincts. If we were to see one kind of wolf, when young and without"
1228,"any training, as soon as it scented its prey, stand motionless like a"
1228,"statue, and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar gait; and another"
1228,"kind of wolf rushing round, instead of at, a herd of deer, and driving"
1228,"them to a distant point, we should assuredly call these actions"
1228,"instinctive. Domestic instincts, as they may be called, are certainly"
1228,far less fixed or invariable than natural instincts; but they have been
1228,"acted on by far less rigorous selection, and have been transmitted for"
1228,"an incomparably shorter period, under less fixed conditions of life."
1228,
1228,"How strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions are"
1228,"inherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when"
1228,different breeds of dogs are crossed. Thus it is known that a cross with
1228,a bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy
1228,of greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family
1228,"of shepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares. These domestic instincts,"
1228,"when thus tested by crossing, resemble natural instincts, which in a"
1228,"like manner become curiously blended together, and for a long period"
1228,"exhibit traces of the instincts of either parent: for example, Le Roy"
1228,"describes a dog, whose great-grandfather was a wolf, and this dog"
1228,"showed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way, by not coming in a"
1228,straight line to his master when called.
1228,
1228,Domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become
1228,"inherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this,"
1228,"I think, is not true. No one would ever have thought of teaching, or"
1228,"probably could have taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble,--an action"
1228,"which, as I have witnessed, is performed by young birds, that have"
1228,never seen a pigeon tumble. We may believe that some one pigeon showed
1228,"a slight tendency to this strange habit, and that the long-continued"
1228,selection of the best individuals in successive generations made
1228,"tumblers what they now are; and near Glasgow there are house-tumblers,"
1228,"as I hear from Mr. Brent, which cannot fly eighteen inches high without"
1228,going head over heels. It may be doubted whether any one would have
1228,"thought of training a dog to point, had not some one dog naturally shown"
1228,"a tendency in this line; and this is known occasionally to happen, as I"
1228,"once saw in a pure terrier. When the first tendency was once displayed,"
1228,methodical selection and the inherited effects of compulsory training in
1228,each successive generation would soon complete the work; and unconscious
1228,"selection is still at work, as each man tries to procure, without"
1228,"intending to improve the breed, dogs which will stand and hunt best."
1228,"On the other hand, habit alone in some cases has sufficed; no animal is"
1228,more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit; scarcely any
1228,animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit; but I do not suppose
1228,that domestic rabbits have ever been selected for tameness; and I
1228,presume that we must attribute the whole of the inherited change from
1228,"extreme wildness to extreme tameness, simply to habit and long-continued"
1228,close confinement.
1228,
1228,Natural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance of
1228,this is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become
1228,"""broody,"" that is, never wish to sit on their eggs. Familiarity alone"
1228,prevents our seeing how universally and largely the minds of our
1228,domestic animals have been modified by domestication. It is scarcely
1228,possible to doubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the
1228,"dog. All wolves, foxes, jackals, and species of the cat genus, when"
1228,"kept tame, are most eager to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs; and this"
1228,tendency has been found incurable in dogs which have been brought home
1228,"as puppies from countries, such as Tierra del Fuego and Australia, where"
1228,"the savages do not keep these domestic animals. How rarely, on the other"
1228,"hand, do our civilised dogs, even when quite young, require to be taught"
1228,"not to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs! No doubt they occasionally"
1228,"do make an attack, and are then beaten; and if not cured, they are"
1228,"destroyed; so that habit, with some degree of selection, has probably"
1228,"concurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs. On the other hand,"
1228,"young chickens have lost, wholly by habit, that fear of the dog and cat"
1228,"which no doubt was originally instinctive in them, in the same way as it"
1228,"is so plainly instinctive in young pheasants, though reared under a hen."
1228,"It is not that chickens have lost all fear, but fear only of dogs and"
1228,"cats, for if the hen gives the danger-chuckle, they will run (more"
1228,"especially young turkeys) from under her, and conceal themselves in"
1228,the surrounding grass or thickets; and this is evidently done for the
1228,"instinctive purpose of allowing, as we see in wild ground-birds, their"
1228,mother to fly away. But this instinct retained by our chickens has
1228,"become useless under domestication, for the mother-hen has almost lost"
1228,by disuse the power of flight.
1228,
1228,"Hence, we may conclude, that domestic instincts have been acquired and"
1228,"natural instincts have been lost partly by habit, and partly by man"
1228,"selecting and accumulating during successive generations, peculiar"
1228,"mental habits and actions, which at first appeared from what we must in"
1228,our ignorance call an accident. In some cases compulsory habit alone
1228,has sufficed to produce such inherited mental changes; in other cases
1228,"compulsory habit has done nothing, and all has been the result of"
1228,"selection, pursued both methodically and unconsciously; but in most"
1228,"cases, probably, habit and selection have acted together."
1228,
1228,"We shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of nature"
1228,"have become modified by selection, by considering a few cases. I will"
1228,"select only three, out of the several which I shall have to discuss in"
1228,"my future work,--namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her"
1228,eggs in other birds' nests; the slave-making instinct of certain ants;
1228,and the comb-making power of the hive-bee: these two latter instincts
1228,"have generally, and most justly, been ranked by naturalists as the most"
1228,wonderful of all known instincts.
1228,
1228,It is now commonly admitted that the more immediate and final cause
1228,"of the cuckoo's instinct is, that she lays her eggs, not daily, but at"
1228,"intervals of two or three days; so that, if she were to make her own"
1228,"nest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left"
1228,"for some time unincubated, or there would be eggs and young birds of"
1228,"different ages in the same nest. If this were the case, the process of"
1228,"laying and hatching might be inconveniently long, more especially as she"
1228,has to migrate at a very early period; and the first hatched young would
1228,probably have to be fed by the male alone. But the American cuckoo is
1228,in this predicament; for she makes her own nest and has eggs and young
1228,"successively hatched, all at the same time. It has been asserted that"
1228,the American cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other birds' nests;
1228,"but I hear on the high authority of Dr. Brewer, that this is a mistake."
1228,"Nevertheless, I could give several instances of various birds which have"
1228,been known occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds' nests. Now let
1228,us suppose that the ancient progenitor of our European cuckoo had the
1228,habits of the American cuckoo; but that occasionally she laid an egg in
1228,"another bird's nest. If the old bird profited by this occasional habit,"
1228,or if the young were made more vigorous by advantage having been taken
1228,"of the mistaken maternal instinct of another bird, than by their own"
1228,"mother's care, encumbered as she can hardly fail to be by having eggs"
1228,and young of different ages at the same time; then the old birds or the
1228,fostered young would gain an advantage. And analogy would lead me
1228,"to believe, that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by"
1228,"inheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in"
1228,"their turn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and"
1228,thus be successful in rearing their young. By a continued process of
1228,"this nature, I believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo could be,"
1228,"and has been, generated. I may add that, according to Dr. Gray and"
1228,"to some other observers, the European cuckoo has not utterly lost all"
1228,maternal love and care for her own offspring.
1228,
1228,"The occasional habit of birds laying their eggs in other birds' nests,"
1228,"either of the same or of a distinct species, is not very uncommon with"
1228,the Gallinaceae; and this perhaps explains the origin of a singular
1228,"instinct in the allied group of ostriches. For several hen ostriches,"
1228,"at least in the case of the American species, unite and lay first a"
1228,few eggs in one nest and then in another; and these are hatched by the
1228,males. This instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the
1228,"hens laying a large number of eggs; but, as in the case of the cuckoo,"
1228,"at intervals of two or three days. This instinct, however, of the"
1228,American ostrich has not as yet been perfected; for a surprising number
1228,"of eggs lie strewed over the plains, so that in one day's hunting I"
1228,picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs.
1228,
1228,"Many bees are parasitic, and always lay their eggs in the nests of bees"
1228,of other kinds. This case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo;
1228,for these bees have not only their instincts but their structure
1228,modified in accordance with their parasitic habits; for they do not
1228,possess the pollen-collecting apparatus which would be necessary if
1228,"they had to store food for their own young. Some species, likewise, of"
1228,Sphegidae (wasp-like insects) are parasitic on other species; and M.
1228,Fabre has lately shown good reason for believing that although the
1228,Tachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with
1228,"paralysed prey for its own larvae to feed on, yet that when this insect"
1228,"finds a burrow already made and stored by another sphex, it takes"
1228,"advantage of the prize, and becomes for the occasion parasitic. In this"
1228,"case, as with the supposed case of the cuckoo, I can see no difficulty"
1228,"in natural selection making an occasional habit permanent, if of"
1228,"advantage to the species, and if the insect whose nest and stored food"
1228,"are thus feloniously appropriated, be not thus exterminated."
1228,
1228,SLAVE-MAKING INSTINCT.
1228,
1228,This remarkable instinct was first discovered in the Formica (Polyerges)
1228,"rufescens by Pierre Huber, a better observer even than his celebrated"
1228,father. This ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves; without their
1228,"aid, the species would certainly become extinct in a single year. The"
1228,"males and fertile females do no work. The workers or sterile females,"
1228,"though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no other"
1228,"work. They are incapable of making their own nests, or of feeding their"
1228,"own larvae. When the old nest is found inconvenient, and they have to"
1228,"migrate, it is the slaves which determine the migration, and actually"
1228,"carry their masters in their jaws. So utterly helpless are the masters,"
1228,"that when Huber shut up thirty of them without a slave, but with plenty"
1228,"of the food which they like best, and with their larvae and pupae to"
1228,"stimulate them to work, they did nothing; they could not even feed"
1228,"themselves, and many perished of hunger. Huber then introduced a single"
1228,"slave (F. fusca), and she instantly set to work, fed and saved the"
1228,"survivors; made some cells and tended the larvae, and put all to rights."
1228,What can be more extraordinary than these well-ascertained facts? If we
1228,"had not known of any other slave-making ant, it would have been"
1228,hopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been
1228,perfected.
1228,
1228,Formica sanguinea was likewise first discovered by P. Huber to be
1228,a slave-making ant. This species is found in the southern parts of
1228,"England, and its habits have been attended to by Mr. F. Smith, of the"
1228,"British Museum, to whom I am much indebted for information on this and"
1228,other subjects. Although fully trusting to the statements of Huber and
1228,"Mr. Smith, I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of"
1228,"mind, as any one may well be excused for doubting the truth of so"
1228,extraordinary and odious an instinct as that of making slaves. Hence
1228,"I will give the observations which I have myself made, in some little"
1228,"detail. I opened fourteen nests of F. sanguinea, and found a few slaves"
1228,in all. Males and fertile females of the slave-species are found only in
1228,"their own proper communities, and have never been observed in the nests"
1228,of F. sanguinea. The slaves are black and not above half the size of
1228,"their red masters, so that the contrast in their appearance is very"
1228,"great. When the nest is slightly disturbed, the slaves occasionally come"
1228,"out, and like their masters are much agitated and defend the nest: when"
1228,"the nest is much disturbed and the larvae and pupae are exposed, the"
1228,slaves work energetically with their masters in carrying them away to a
1228,"place of safety. Hence, it is clear, that the slaves feel quite at home."
1228,"During the months of June and July, on three successive years, I have"
1228,"watched for many hours several nests in Surrey and Sussex, and never"
1228,"saw a slave either leave or enter a nest. As, during these months,"
1228,"the slaves are very few in number, I thought that they might behave"
1228,differently when more numerous; but Mr. Smith informs me that he has
1228,"watched the nests at various hours during May, June and August, both in"
1228,"Surrey and Hampshire, and has never seen the slaves, though present"
1228,"in large numbers in August, either leave or enter the nest. Hence he"
1228,"considers them as strictly household slaves. The masters, on the other"
1228,"hand, may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest, and"
1228,"food of all kinds. During the present year, however, in the month of"
1228,"July, I came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves,"
1228,"and I observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest,"
1228,"and marching along the same road to a tall Scotch-fir-tree, twenty-five"
1228,"yards distant, which they ascended together, probably in search of"
1228,"aphides or cocci. According to Huber, who had ample opportunities"
1228,"for observation, in Switzerland the slaves habitually work with their"
1228,"masters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in"
1228,"the morning and evening; and, as Huber expressly states, their principal"
1228,office is to search for aphides. This difference in the usual habits of
1228,"the masters and slaves in the two countries, probably depends merely"
1228,on the slaves being captured in greater numbers in Switzerland than in
1228,England.
1228,
1228,One day I fortunately chanced to witness a migration from one nest to
1228,"another, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters"
1228,"carefully carrying, as Huber has described, their slaves in their jaws."
1228,Another day my attention was struck by about a score of the slave-makers
1228,"haunting the same spot, and evidently not in search of food; they"
1228,approached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of
1228,the slave species (F. fusca); sometimes as many as three of these
1228,ants clinging to the legs of the slave-making F. sanguinea. The latter
1228,"ruthlessly killed their small opponents, and carried their dead"
1228,"bodies as food to their nest, twenty-nine yards distant; but they were"
1228,prevented from getting any pupae to rear as slaves. I then dug up a
1228,"small parcel of the pupae of F. fusca from another nest, and put them"
1228,"down on a bare spot near the place of combat; they were eagerly seized,"
1228,"and carried off by the tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all,"
1228,they had been victorious in their late combat.
1228,
1228,At the same time I laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupae of
1228,"another species, F. flava, with a few of these little yellow ants still"
1228,"clinging to the fragments of the nest. This species is sometimes, though"
1228,"rarely, made into slaves, as has been described by Mr. Smith."
1228,"Although so small a species, it is very courageous, and I have seen it"
1228,ferociously attack other ants. In one instance I found to my surprise
1228,an independent community of F. flava under a stone beneath a nest of the
1228,slave-making F. sanguinea; and when I had accidentally disturbed both
1228,"nests, the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprising"
1228,courage. Now I was curious to ascertain whether F. sanguinea could
1228,"distinguish the pupae of F. fusca, which they habitually make into"
1228,"slaves, from those of the little and furious F. flava, which they rarely"
1228,"capture, and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them:"
1228,for we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupae of F.
1228,"fusca, whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pupae,"
1228,"or even the earth from the nest of F. flava, and quickly ran away; but"
1228,"in about a quarter of an hour, shortly after all the little yellow ants"
1228,"had crawled away, they took heart and carried off the pupae."
1228,
1228,"One evening I visited another community of F. sanguinea, and found a"
1228,"number of these ants entering their nest, carrying the dead bodies of F."
1228,fusca (showing that it was not a migration) and numerous pupae. I traced
1228,"the returning file burthened with booty, for about forty yards, to"
1228,"a very thick clump of heath, whence I saw the last individual of F."
1228,"sanguinea emerge, carrying a pupa; but I was not able to find the"
1228,"desolated nest in the thick heath. The nest, however, must have been"
1228,"close at hand, for two or three individuals of F. fusca were rushing"
1228,"about in the greatest agitation, and one was perched motionless with its"
1228,own pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of heath over its ravaged
1228,home.
1228,
1228,"Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in"
1228,regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves. Let it be observed
1228,what a contrast the instinctive habits of F. sanguinea present with
1228,"those of the F. rufescens. The latter does not build its own nest, does"
1228,"not determine its own migrations, does not collect food for itself or"
1228,"its young, and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely dependent on"
1228,"its numerous slaves. Formica sanguinea, on the other hand, possesses"
1228,"much fewer slaves, and in the early part of the summer extremely few."
1228,"The masters determine when and where a new nest shall be formed, and"
1228,"when they migrate, the masters carry the slaves. Both in Switzerland and"
1228,"England the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of the larvae, and"
1228,the masters alone go on slave-making expeditions. In Switzerland the
1228,"slaves and masters work together, making and bringing materials for the"
1228,"nest: both, but chiefly the slaves, tend, and milk as it may be called,"
1228,their aphides; and thus both collect food for the community. In England
1228,the masters alone usually leave the nest to collect building materials
1228,"and food for themselves, their slaves and larvae. So that the masters in"
1228,this country receive much less service from their slaves than they do in
1228,Switzerland.
1228,
1228,By what steps the instinct of F. sanguinea originated I will not pretend
1228,"to conjecture. But as ants, which are not slave-makers, will, as I have"
1228,"seen, carry off pupae of other species, if scattered near their nests,"
1228,it is possible that pupae originally stored as food might become
1228,developed; and the ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow
1228,"their proper instincts, and do what work they could. If their presence"
1228,proved useful to the species which had seized them--if it were more
1228,advantageous to this species to capture workers than to procreate
1228,them--the habit of collecting pupae originally for food might by natural
1228,selection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the very different
1228,"purpose of raising slaves. When the instinct was once acquired, if"
1228,"carried out to a much less extent even than in our British F. sanguinea,"
1228,"which, as we have seen, is less aided by its slaves than the same"
1228,"species in Switzerland, I can see no difficulty in natural selection"
1228,increasing and modifying the instinct--always supposing each
1228,modification to be of use to the species--until an ant was formed as
1228,abjectly dependent on its slaves as is the Formica rufescens.
1228,
1228,CELL-MAKING INSTINCT OF THE HIVE-BEE.
1228,
1228,"I will not here enter on minute details on this subject, but will merely"
1228,give an outline of the conclusions at which I have arrived. He must be
1228,"a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb, so"
1228,"beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration. We"
1228,hear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite
1228,"problem, and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the"
1228,"greatest possible amount of honey, with the least possible consumption"
1228,of precious wax in their construction. It has been remarked that a
1228,"skilful workman, with fitting tools and measures, would find it"
1228,"very difficult to make cells of wax of the true form, though this is"
1228,perfectly effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive. Grant
1228,"whatever instincts you please, and it seems at first quite inconceivable"
1228,"how they can make all the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive"
1228,when they are correctly made. But the difficulty is not nearly so great
1228,"as it at first appears: all this beautiful work can be shown, I think,"
1228,to follow from a few very simple instincts.
1228,
1228,"I was led to investigate this subject by Mr. Waterhouse, who has shown"
1228,that the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of
1228,"adjoining cells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only"
1228,as a modification of his theory. Let us look to the great principle of
1228,"gradation, and see whether Nature does not reveal to us her method of"
1228,"work. At one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their"
1228,"old cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax,"
1228,and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax. At
1228,"the other end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in"
1228,"a double layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with"
1228,"the basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join on to a pyramid,"
1228,"formed of three rhombs. These rhombs have certain angles, and the three"
1228,"which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb,"
1228,enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the
1228,opposite side. In the series between the extreme perfection of the cells
1228,"of the hive-bee and the simplicity of those of the humble-bee, we have"
1228,"the cells of the Mexican Melipona domestica, carefully described"
1228,and figured by Pierre Huber. The Melipona itself is intermediate in
1228,"structure between the hive and humble bee, but more nearly related to"
1228,"the latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells,"
1228,"in which the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of"
1228,wax for holding honey. These latter cells are nearly spherical and of
1228,"nearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an irregular mass. But the"
1228,"important point to notice, is that these cells are always made at that"
1228,"degree of nearness to each other, that they would have intersected or"
1228,"broken into each other, if the spheres had been completed; but this is"
1228,"never permitted, the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between"
1228,the spheres which thus tend to intersect. Hence each cell consists of
1228,"an outer spherical portion and of two, three, or more perfectly flat"
1228,"surfaces, according as the cell adjoins two, three or more other cells."
1228,"When one cell comes into contact with three other cells, which, from"
1228,"the spheres being nearly of the same size, is very frequently and"
1228,"necessarily the case, the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid;"
1228,"and this pyramid, as Huber has remarked, is manifestly a gross imitation"
1228,of the three-sided pyramidal basis of the cell of the hive-bee. As in
1228,"the cells of the hive-bee, so here, the three plane surfaces in any one"
1228,cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells.
1228,It is obvious that the Melipona saves wax by this manner of building;
1228,"for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double, but are"
1228,"of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions, and yet each flat"
1228,portion forms a part of two cells.
1228,
1228,"Reflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the Melipona had made"
1228,"its spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made them of"
1228,"equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer, the"
1228,resulting structure would probably have been as perfect as the comb of
1228,"the hive-bee. Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller, of Cambridge,"
1228,"and this geometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up"
1228,"from his information, and tells me that it is strictly correct:--"
1228,
1228,If a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in
1228,two parallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at the distance of
1228,radius x the square root of  or radius x . (or at some lesser
1228,"distance), from the centres of the six surrounding spheres in the"
1228,same layer; and at the same distance from the centres of the adjoining
1228,"spheres in the other and parallel layer; then, if planes of intersection"
1228,"between the several spheres in both layers be formed, there will result"
1228,a double layer of hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases
1228,formed of three rhombs; and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal
1228,prisms will have every angle identically the same with the best
1228,measurements which have been made of the cells of the hive-bee.
1228,
1228,Hence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify the
1228,"instincts already possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves not very"
1228,"wonderful, this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as"
1228,that of the hive-bee. We must suppose the Melipona to make her cells
1228,"truly spherical, and of equal sizes; and this would not be very"
1228,"surprising, seeing that she already does so to a certain extent, and"
1228,seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows in wood many insects can
1228,"make, apparently by turning round on a fixed point. We must suppose the"
1228,"Melipona to arrange her cells in level layers, as she already does her"
1228,"cylindrical cells; and we must further suppose, and this is the greatest"
1228,"difficulty, that she can somehow judge accurately at what distance to"
1228,stand from her fellow-labourers when several are making their spheres;
1228,"but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance, that she always"
1228,describes her spheres so as to intersect largely; and then she unites
1228,the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces. We have further
1228,"to suppose, but this is no difficulty, that after hexagonal prisms have"
1228,"been formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the same layer,"
1228,she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the stock of
1228,honey; in the same way as the rude humble-bee adds cylinders of wax
1228,to the circular mouths of her old cocoons. By such modifications of
1228,"instincts in themselves not very wonderful,--hardly more wonderful than"
1228,"those which guide a bird to make its nest,--I believe that the hive-bee"
1228,"has acquired, through natural selection, her inimitable architectural"
1228,powers.
1228,
1228,But this theory can be tested by experiment. Following the example of
1228,"Mr. Tegetmeier, I separated two combs, and put between them a long,"
1228,"thick, square strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate minute"
1228,"circular pits in it; and as they deepened these little pits, they made"
1228,"them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins,"
1228,"appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of about"
1228,the diameter of a cell. It was most interesting to me to observe that
1228,"wherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together,"
1228,"they had begun their work at such a distance from each other, that by"
1228,the time the basins had acquired the above stated width (i.e. about the
1228,"width of an ordinary cell), and were in depth about one sixth of the"
1228,"diameter of the sphere of which they formed a part, the rims of the"
1228,"basins intersected or broke into each other. As soon as this occurred,"
1228,"the bees ceased to excavate, and began to build up flat walls of wax"
1228,"on the lines of intersection between the basins, so that each hexagonal"
1228,"prism was built upon the festooned edge of a smooth basin, instead of on"
1228,the straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as in the case of ordinary
1228,cells.
1228,
1228,"I then put into the hive, instead of a thick, square piece of wax, a"
1228,"thin and narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with vermilion. The bees"
1228,instantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each
1228,"other, in the same way as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin, that"
1228,"the bottoms of the basins, if they had been excavated to the same depth"
1228,"as in the former experiment, would have broken into each other from the"
1228,"opposite sides. The bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and"
1228,"they stopped their excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon"
1228,"as they had been a little deepened, came to have flat bottoms; and these"
1228,"flat bottoms, formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having"
1228,"been left ungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge,"
1228,exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on
1228,"the opposite sides of the ridge of wax. In parts, only little bits, in"
1228,"other parts, large portions of a rhombic plate had been left between the"
1228,"opposed basins, but the work, from the unnatural state of things, had"
1228,not been neatly performed. The bees must have worked at very nearly the
1228,"same rate on the opposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, as they"
1228,"circularly gnawed away and deepened the basins on both sides, in order"
1228,"to have succeeded in thus leaving flat plates between the basins, by"
1228,stopping work along the intermediate planes or planes of intersection.
1228,
1228,"Considering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is any"
1228,"difficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip"
1228,"of wax, perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper"
1228,"thinness, and then stopping their work. In ordinary combs it has"
1228,appeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly
1228,the same rate from the opposite sides; for I have noticed half-completed
1228,"rhombs at the base of a just-commenced cell, which were slightly concave"
1228,"on one side, where I suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly,"
1228,"and convex on the opposed side, where the bees had worked less quickly."
1228,"In one well-marked instance, I put the comb back into the hive, and"
1228,"allowed the bees to go on working for a short time, and again examined"
1228,"the cell, and I found that the rhombic plate had been completed, and had"
1228,"become PERFECTLY FLAT: it was absolutely impossible, from the extreme"
1228,"thinness of the little rhombic plate, that they could have effected this"
1228,by gnawing away the convex side; and I suspect that the bees in such
1228,cases stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm
1228,wax (which as I have tried is easily done) into its proper intermediate
1228,"plane, and thus flatten it."
1228,
1228,"From the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax, we can clearly see"
1228,"that if the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they"
1228,"could make their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper"
1228,"distance from each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by"
1228,"endeavouring to make equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the"
1228,"spheres to break into each other. Now bees, as may be clearly seen by"
1228,"examining the edge of a growing comb, do make a rough, circumferential"
1228,wall or rim all round the comb; and they gnaw into this from the
1228,"opposite sides, always working circularly as they deepen each cell. They"
1228,do not make the whole three-sided pyramidal base of any one cell at the
1228,"same time, but only the one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme"
1228,"growing margin, or the two plates, as the case may be; and they never"
1228,"complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates, until the hexagonal"
1228,walls are commenced. Some of these statements differ from those made by
1228,"the justly celebrated elder Huber, but I am convinced of their accuracy;"
1228,"and if I had space, I could show that they are conformable with my"
1228,theory.
1228,
1228,Huber's statement that the very first cell is excavated out of a little
1228,"parallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as I have seen, strictly"
1228,correct; the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax;
1228,but I will not here enter on these details. We see how important a part
1228,excavation plays in the construction of the cells; but it would be a
1228,great error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax
1228,"in the proper position--that is, along the plane of intersection between"
1228,two adjoining spheres. I have several specimens showing clearly that
1228,they can do this. Even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax
1228,"round a growing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding"
1228,in position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells.
1228,"But the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being"
1228,largely gnawed away on both sides. The manner in which the bees build is
1228,curious; they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times
1228,"thicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell, which will"
1228,"ultimately be left. We shall understand how they work, by supposing"
1228,"masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement, and then to begin"
1228,"cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground, till a smooth,"
1228,very thin wall is left in the middle; the masons always piling up the
1228,"cut-away cement, and adding fresh cement, on the summit of the ridge. We"
1228,shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward; but always crowned
1228,"by a gigantic coping. From all the cells, both those just commenced and"
1228,"those completed, being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax, the"
1228,bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate
1228,"hexagonal walls, which are only about one four-hundredth of an inch in"
1228,thickness; the plates of the pyramidal basis being about twice as thick.
1228,"By this singular manner of building, strength is continually given to"
1228,"the comb, with the utmost ultimate economy of wax."
1228,
1228,It seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the
1228,"cells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee"
1228,"after working a short time at one cell going to another, so that, as"
1228,"Huber has stated, a score of individuals work even at the commencement"
1228,"of the first cell. I was able practically to show this fact, by covering"
1228,"the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the extreme margin"
1228,"of the circumferential rim of a growing comb, with an extremely thin"
1228,layer of melted vermilion wax; and I invariably found that the colour
1228,was most delicately diffused by the bees--as delicately as a painter
1228,could have done with his brush--by atoms of the coloured wax having been
1228,"taken from the spot on which it had been placed, and worked into the"
1228,growing edges of the cells all round. The work of construction seems
1228,"to be a sort of balance struck between many bees, all instinctively"
1228,"standing at the same relative distance from each other, all trying to"
1228,"sweep equal spheres, and then building up, or leaving ungnawed, the"
1228,planes of intersection between these spheres. It was really curious to
1228,"note in cases of difficulty, as when two pieces of comb met at an angle,"
1228,how often the bees would entirely pull down and rebuild in different
1228,"ways the same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at"
1228,first rejected.
1228,
1228,When bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions
1228,"for working,--for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly under the"
1228,middle of a comb growing downwards so that the comb has to be built over
1228,one face of the slip--in this case the bees can lay the foundations
1228,"of one wall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place, projecting"
1228,beyond the other completed cells. It suffices that the bees should be
1228,enabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other
1228,"and from the walls of the last completed cells, and then, by striking"
1228,"imaginary spheres, they can build up a wall intermediate between two"
1228,"adjoining spheres; but, as far as I have seen, they never gnaw away and"
1228,finish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and
1228,of the adjoining cells has been built. This capacity in bees of laying
1228,down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place
1228,"between two just-commenced cells, is important, as it bears on a fact,"
1228,"which seems at first quite subversive of the foregoing theory; namely,"
1228,that the cells on the extreme margin of wasp-combs are sometimes
1228,strictly hexagonal; but I have not space here to enter on this subject.
1228,Nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect (as
1228,"in the case of a queen-wasp) making hexagonal cells, if she work"
1228,alternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at
1228,"the same time, always standing at the proper relative distance from"
1228,"the parts of the cells just begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and"
1228,building up intermediate planes. It is even conceivable that an insect
1228,"might, by fixing on a point at which to commence a cell, and then moving"
1228,"outside, first to one point, and then to five other points, at the"
1228,"proper relative distances from the central point and from each other,"
1228,"strike the planes of intersection, and so make an isolated hexagon: but"
1228,I am not aware that any such case has been observed; nor would any good
1228,"be derived from a single hexagon being built, as in its construction"
1228,more materials would be required than for a cylinder.
1228,
1228,As natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight
1228,"modifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the"
1228,"individual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how"
1228,"a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts,"
1228,"all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction, could"
1228,have profited the progenitors of the hive-bee? I think the answer is
1228,not difficult: it is known that bees are often hard pressed to get
1228,sufficient nectar; and I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been
1228,experimentally found that no less than from twelve to fifteen pounds of
1228,dry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of each pound
1228,of wax; so that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected
1228,and consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax
1228,"necessary for the construction of their combs. Moreover, many bees have"
1228,to remain idle for many days during the process of secretion. A large
1228,store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during
1228,the winter; and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on a
1228,large number of bees being supported. Hence the saving of wax by largely
1228,saving honey must be a most important element of success in any family
1228,of bees. Of course the success of any species of bee may be dependent
1228,"on the number of its parasites or other enemies, or on quite distinct"
1228,"causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which"
1228,the bees could collect. But let us suppose that this latter circumstance
1228,"determined, as it probably often does determine, the numbers of a"
1228,humble-bee which could exist in a country; and let us further suppose
1228,"that the community lived throughout the winter, and consequently"
1228,required a store of honey: there can in this case be no doubt that it
1228,"would be an advantage to our humble-bee, if a slight modification of"
1228,"her instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together, so as to"
1228,"intersect a little; for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells,"
1228,would save some little wax. Hence it would continually be more and more
1228,"advantageous to our humble-bee, if she were to make her cells more and"
1228,"more regular, nearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the"
1228,cells of the Melipona; for in this case a large part of the bounding
1228,"surface of each cell would serve to bound other cells, and much wax"
1228,"would be saved. Again, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to"
1228,"the Melipona, if she were to make her cells closer together, and more"
1228,"regular in every way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the"
1228,"spherical surfaces would wholly disappear, and would all be replaced by"
1228,plane surfaces; and the Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of
1228,"the hive-bee. Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, natural"
1228,"selection could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can"
1228,"see, is absolutely perfect in economising wax."
1228,
1228,"Thus, as I believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that"
1228,"of the hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken"
1228,"advantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler"
1228,"instincts; natural selection having by slow degrees, more and more"
1228,"perfectly, led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from"
1228,"each other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax along"
1228,"the planes of intersection. The bees, of course, no more knowing that"
1228,"they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other,"
1228,than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and
1228,of the basal rhombic plates. The motive power of the process of natural
1228,selection having been economy of wax; that individual swarm which wasted
1228,"least honey in the secretion of wax, having succeeded best, and having"
1228,transmitted by inheritance its newly acquired economical instinct to new
1228,"swarms, which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding"
1228,in the struggle for existence.
1228,
1228,No doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed
1228,"to the theory of natural selection,--cases, in which we cannot see"
1228,"how an instinct could possibly have originated; cases, in which no"
1228,intermediate gradations are known to exist; cases of instinct of
1228,"apparently such trifling importance, that they could hardly have been"
1228,acted on by natural selection; cases of instincts almost identically the
1228,"same in animals so remote in the scale of nature, that we cannot account"
1228,"for their similarity by inheritance from a common parent, and must"
1228,therefore believe that they have been acquired by independent acts of
1228,"natural selection. I will not here enter on these several cases, but"
1228,"will confine myself to one special difficulty, which at first appeared"
1228,"to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my whole theory. I allude to"
1228,the neuters or sterile females in insect-communities: for these neuters
1228,often differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males
1228,"and fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate"
1228,their kind.
1228,
1228,"The subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but I will"
1228,"here take only a single case, that of working or sterile ants. How the"
1228,workers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not much greater
1228,than that of any other striking modification of structure; for it can
1228,be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of
1228,"nature occasionally become sterile; and if such insects had been social,"
1228,and it had been profitable to the community that a number should have
1228,"been annually born capable of work, but incapable of procreation, I"
1228,can see no very great difficulty in this being effected by natural
1228,selection. But I must pass over this preliminary difficulty. The great
1228,difficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the males
1228,"and the fertile females in structure, as in the shape of the thorax and"
1228,"in being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes, and in instinct. As"
1228,"far as instinct alone is concerned, the prodigious difference in this"
1228,"respect between the workers and the perfect females, would have been"
1228,far better exemplified by the hive-bee. If a working ant or other
1228,"neuter insect had been an animal in the ordinary state, I should have"
1228,unhesitatingly assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired
1228,"through natural selection; namely, by an individual having been born"
1228,"with some slight profitable modification of structure, this being"
1228,"inherited by its offspring, which again varied and were again selected,"
1228,and so onwards. But with the working ant we have an insect differing
1228,"greatly from its parents, yet absolutely sterile; so that it could never"
1228,have transmitted successively acquired modifications of structure or
1228,instinct to its progeny. It may well be asked how is it possible to
1228,reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?
1228,
1228,"First, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in"
1228,"our domestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all sorts"
1228,of differences of structure which have become correlated to certain
1228,"ages, and to either sex. We have differences correlated not only to"
1228,"one sex, but to that short period alone when the reproductive system is"
1228,"active, as in the nuptial plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws"
1228,of the male salmon. We have even slight differences in the horns of
1228,different breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect
1228,state of the male sex; for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than
1228,"in other breeds, in comparison with the horns of the bulls or cows of"
1228,these same breeds. Hence I can see no real difficulty in any character
1228,having become correlated with the sterile condition of certain members
1228,of insect-communities: the difficulty lies in understanding how such
1228,correlated modifications of structure could have been slowly accumulated
1228,by natural selection.
1228,
1228,"This difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I"
1228,"believe, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied"
1228,"to the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the"
1228,"desired end. Thus, a well-flavoured vegetable is cooked, and the"
1228,individual is destroyed; but the horticulturist sows seeds of the same
1228,"stock, and confidently expects to get nearly the same variety; breeders"
1228,of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together; the animal
1228,"has been slaughtered, but the breeder goes with confidence to the same"
1228,"family. I have such faith in the powers of selection, that I do not"
1228,"doubt that a breed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily"
1228,"long horns, could be slowly formed by carefully watching which"
1228,"individual bulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest"
1228,horns; and yet no one ox could ever have propagated its kind. Thus
1228,I believe it has been with social insects: a slight modification of
1228,"structure, or instinct, correlated with the sterile condition of certain"
1228,"members of the community, has been advantageous to the community:"
1228,consequently the fertile males and females of the same community
1228,"flourished, and transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to"
1228,produce sterile members having the same modification. And I believe
1228,"that this process has been repeated, until that prodigious amount of"
1228,difference between the fertile and sterile females of the same species
1228,"has been produced, which we see in many social insects."
1228,
1228,"But we have not as yet touched on the climax of the difficulty; namely,"
1228,"the fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the"
1228,"fertile females and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost"
1228,"incredible degree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes."
1228,"The castes, moreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but are"
1228,"perfectly well defined; being as distinct from each other, as are any"
1228,"two species of the same genus, or rather as any two genera of the same"
1228,"family. Thus in Eciton, there are working and soldier neuters, with jaws"
1228,"and instincts extraordinarily different: in Cryptocerus, the workers of"
1228,"one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads, the use"
1228,"of which is quite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus, the workers of"
1228,one caste never leave the nest; they are fed by the workers of another
1228,"caste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen which secretes a"
1228,"sort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted by the aphides, or"
1228,"the domestic cattle as they may be called, which our European ants guard"
1228,or imprison.
1228,
1228,It will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the
1228,"principle of natural selection, when I do not admit that such wonderful"
1228,and well-established facts at once annihilate my theory. In the simpler
1228,"case of neuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind, which have"
1228,"been rendered by natural selection, as I believe to be quite possible,"
1228,"different from the fertile males and females,--in this case, we may"
1228,"safely conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations, that each"
1228,"successive, slight, profitable modification did not probably at first"
1228,"appear in all the individual neuters in the same nest, but in a few"
1228,alone; and that by the long-continued selection of the fertile parents
1228,"which produced most neuters with the profitable modification, all the"
1228,neuters ultimately came to have the desired character. On this view we
1228,"ought occasionally to find neuter-insects of the same species, in the"
1228,"same nest, presenting gradations of structure; and this we do find,"
1228,"even often, considering how few neuter-insects out of Europe have been"
1228,carefully examined. Mr. F. Smith has shown how surprisingly the neuters
1228,of several British ants differ from each other in size and sometimes
1228,in colour; and that the extreme forms can sometimes be perfectly linked
1228,together by individuals taken out of the same nest: I have myself
1228,compared perfect gradations of this kind. It often happens that the
1228,larger or the smaller sized workers are the most numerous; or that both
1228,"large and small are numerous, with those of an intermediate size scanty"
1228,"in numbers. Formica flava has larger and smaller workers, with some of"
1228,"intermediate size; and, in this species, as Mr. F. Smith has observed,"
1228,"the larger workers have simple eyes (ocelli), which though small can"
1228,"be plainly distinguished, whereas the smaller workers have their ocelli"
1228,rudimentary. Having carefully dissected several specimens of these
1228,"workers, I can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the"
1228,smaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionally
1228,"lesser size; and I fully believe, though I dare not assert so"
1228,"positively, that the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in"
1228,an exactly intermediate condition. So that we here have two bodies of
1228,"sterile workers in the same nest, differing not only in size, but"
1228,"in their organs of vision, yet connected by some few members in an"
1228,"intermediate condition. I may digress by adding, that if the smaller"
1228,"workers had been the most useful to the community, and those males and"
1228,"females had been continually selected, which produced more and more"
1228,"of the smaller workers, until all the workers had come to be in this"
1228,condition; we should then have had a species of ant with neuters very
1228,nearly in the same condition with those of Myrmica. For the workers of
1228,"Myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli, though the male and female"
1228,ants of this genus have well-developed ocelli.
1228,
1228,I may give one other case: so confidently did I expect to find
1228,gradations in important points of structure between the different castes
1228,"of neuters in the same species, that I gladly availed myself of Mr. F."
1228,Smith's offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver
1228,ant (Anomma) of West Africa. The reader will perhaps best appreciate
1228,"the amount of difference in these workers, by my giving not the actual"
1228,"measurements, but a strictly accurate illustration: the difference was"
1228,the same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house of whom
1228,"many were five feet four inches high, and many sixteen feet high; but"
1228,we must suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of three
1228,"times as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws nearly five times"
1228,"as big. The jaws, moreover, of the working ants of the several sizes"
1228,"differed wonderfully in shape, and in the form and number of the teeth."
1228,"But the important fact for us is, that though the workers can be grouped"
1228,"into castes of different sizes, yet they graduate insensibly into each"
1228,"other, as does the widely-different structure of their jaws. I speak"
1228,"confidently on this latter point, as Mr. Lubbock made drawings for"
1228,me with the camera lucida of the jaws which I had dissected from the
1228,workers of the several sizes.
1228,
1228,"With these facts before me, I believe that natural selection, by acting"
1228,"on the fertile parents, could form a species which should regularly"
1228,"produce neuters, either all of large size with one form of jaw, or all"
1228,"of small size with jaws having a widely different structure; or lastly,"
1228,"and this is our climax of difficulty, one set of workers of one size and"
1228,"structure, and simultaneously another set of workers of a different size"
1228,"and structure;--a graduated series having been first formed, as in the"
1228,"case of the driver ant, and then the extreme forms, from being the most"
1228,"useful to the community, having been produced in greater and greater"
1228,numbers through the natural selection of the parents which generated
1228,them; until none with an intermediate structure were produced.
1228,
1228,"Thus, as I believe, the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castes"
1228,"of sterile workers existing in the same nest, both widely different from"
1228,"each other and from their parents, has originated. We can see how useful"
1228,"their production may have been to a social community of insects, on the"
1228,same principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man.
1228,"As ants work by inherited instincts and by inherited tools or weapons,"
1228,"and not by acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments, a perfect"
1228,division of labour could be effected with them only by the workers being
1228,"sterile; for had they been fertile, they would have intercrossed, and"
1228,their instincts and structure would have become blended. And nature
1228,"has, as I believe, effected this admirable division of labour in the"
1228,"communities of ants, by the means of natural selection. But I am bound"
1228,"to confess, that, with all my faith in this principle, I should never"
1228,have anticipated that natural selection could have been efficient in so
1228,"high a degree, had not the case of these neuter insects convinced me"
1228,"of the fact. I have, therefore, discussed this case, at some little"
1228,"but wholly insufficient length, in order to show the power of natural"
1228,"selection, and likewise because this is by far the most serious special"
1228,"difficulty, which my theory has encountered. The case, also, is very"
1228,"interesting, as it proves that with animals, as with plants, any amount"
1228,of modification in structure can be effected by the accumulation of
1228,"numerous, slight, and as we must call them accidental, variations, which"
1228,"are in any manner profitable, without exercise or habit having come into"
1228,"play. For no amount of exercise, or habit, or volition, in the utterly"
1228,sterile members of a community could possibly have affected the
1228,"structure or instincts of the fertile members, which alone leave"
1228,descendants. I am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative
1228,"case of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of Lamarck."
1228,
1228,SUMMARY.
1228,
1228,I have endeavoured briefly in this chapter to show that the mental
1228,"qualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations are"
1228,inherited. Still more briefly I have attempted to show that instincts
1228,vary slightly in a state of nature. No one will dispute that instincts
1228,are of the highest importance to each animal. Therefore I can see no
1228,"difficulty, under changing conditions of life, in natural selection"
1228,"accumulating slight modifications of instinct to any extent, in any"
1228,useful direction. In some cases habit or use and disuse have probably
1228,come into play. I do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter
1228,strengthen in any great degree my theory; but none of the cases of
1228,"difficulty, to the best of my judgment, annihilate it. On the other"
1228,"hand, the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and"
1228,are liable to mistakes;--that no instinct has been produced for the
1228,"exclusive good of other animals, but that each animal takes advantage of"
1228,"the instincts of others;--that the canon in natural history, of ""natura"
1228,"non facit saltum"" is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal"
1228,"structure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is"
1228,"otherwise inexplicable,--all tend to corroborate the theory of natural"
1228,selection.
1228,
1228,"This theory is, also, strengthened by some few other facts in regard"
1228,"to instincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but certainly"
1228,"distinct, species, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living"
1228,"under considerably different conditions of life, yet often retaining"
1228,"nearly the same instincts. For instance, we can understand on the"
1228,"principle of inheritance, how it is that the thrush of South America"
1228,"lines its nest with mud, in the same peculiar manner as does our British"
1228,"thrush: how it is that the male wrens (Troglodytes) of North America,"
1228,"build ""cock-nests,"" to roost in, like the males of our distinct"
1228,"Kitty-wrens,--a habit wholly unlike that of any other known bird."
1228,"Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it"
1228,is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo
1228,"ejecting its foster-brothers,--ants making slaves,--the larvae of"
1228,"ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars,--not as"
1228,"specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one"
1228,"general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely,"
1228,"multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die."

1228,"Sterility various in degree, not universal, affected by close"
1228,"interbreeding, removed by domestication. Laws governing the sterility"
1228,"of hybrids. Sterility not a special endowment, but incidental on other"
1228,differences. Causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids.
1228,Parallelism between the effects of changed conditions of life and
1228,crossing. Fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel
1228,offspring not universal. Hybrids and mongrels compared independently of
1228,their fertility. Summary.
1228,
1228,"The view generally entertained by naturalists is that species, when"
1228,"intercrossed, have been specially endowed with the quality of sterility,"
1228,in order to prevent the confusion of all organic forms. This view
1228,"certainly seems at first probable, for species within the same country"
1228,could hardly have kept distinct had they been capable of crossing
1228,freely. The importance of the fact that hybrids are very generally
1228,"sterile, has, I think, been much underrated by some late writers. On the"
1228,"theory of natural selection the case is especially important, inasmuch"
1228,as the sterility of hybrids could not possibly be of any advantage
1228,"to them, and therefore could not have been acquired by the continued"
1228,"preservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility. I hope,"
1228,"however, to be able to show that sterility is not a specially acquired"
1228,"or endowed quality, but is incidental on other acquired differences."
1228,
1228,"In treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent"
1228,"fundamentally different, have generally been confounded together;"
1228,"namely, the sterility of two species when first crossed, and the"
1228,sterility of the hybrids produced from them.
1228,
1228,Pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect
1228,"condition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no"
1228,"offspring. Hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive organs"
1228,"functionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of the male"
1228,element in both plants and animals; though the organs themselves are
1228,"perfect in structure, as far as the microscope reveals. In the first"
1228,case the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo are perfect; in
1228,"the second case they are either not at all developed, or are imperfectly"
1228,"developed. This distinction is important, when the cause of the"
1228,"sterility, which is common to the two cases, has to be considered. The"
1228,"distinction has probably been slurred over, owing to the sterility in"
1228,"both cases being looked on as a special endowment, beyond the province"
1228,of our reasoning powers.
1228,
1228,"The fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or believed to"
1228,"have descended from common parents, when intercrossed, and likewise"
1228,"the fertility of their mongrel offspring, is, on my theory, of equal"
1228,importance with the sterility of species; for it seems to make a broad
1228,and clear distinction between varieties and species.
1228,
1228,"First, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid"
1228,offspring. It is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of
1228,"those two conscientious and admirable observers, Kolreuter and Gartner,"
1228,"who almost devoted their lives to this subject, without being deeply"
1228,impressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility.
1228,"Kolreuter makes the rule universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in"
1228,"ten cases in which he found two forms, considered by most authors as"
1228,"distinct species, quite fertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks them"
1228,"as varieties. Gartner, also, makes the rule equally universal; and he"
1228,disputes the entire fertility of Kolreuter's ten cases. But in these and
1228,"in many other cases, Gartner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in"
1228,order to show that there is any degree of sterility. He always compares
1228,the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when crossed and by
1228,"their hybrid offspring, with the average number produced by both pure"
1228,parent-species in a state of nature. But a serious cause of error seems
1228,"to me to be here introduced: a plant to be hybridised must be castrated,"
1228,"and, what is often more important, must be secluded in order to prevent"
1228,pollen being brought to it by insects from other plants. Nearly all the
1228,"plants experimentised on by Gartner were potted, and apparently were"
1228,kept in a chamber in his house. That these processes are often injurious
1228,to the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted; for Gartner gives in
1228,"his table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated, and"
1228,"artificially fertilised with their own pollen, and (excluding all cases"
1228,"such as the Leguminosae, in which there is an acknowledged difficulty"
1228,in the manipulation) half of these twenty plants had their fertility
1228,"in some degree impaired. Moreover, as Gartner during several years"
1228,"repeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip, which we have such good"
1228,"reason to believe to be varieties, and only once or twice succeeded in"
1228,getting fertile seed; as he found the common red and blue pimpernels
1228,"(Anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the best botanists rank as"
1228,"varieties, absolutely sterile together; and as he came to the same"
1228,conclusion in several other analogous cases; it seems to me that we
1228,may well be permitted to doubt whether many other species are really so
1228,"sterile, when intercrossed, as Gartner believes."
1228,
1228,"It is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species"
1228,"when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly,"
1228,"and, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species is so easily"
1228,"affected by various circumstances, that for all practical purposes it is"
1228,most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins.
1228,I think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two
1228,"most experienced observers who have ever lived, namely, Kolreuter and"
1228,"Gartner, should have arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions"
1228,in regard to the very same species. It is also most instructive to
1228,compare--but I have not space here to enter on details--the evidence
1228,advanced by our best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful
1228,"forms should be ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from"
1228,"fertility adduced by different hybridisers, or by the same author,"
1228,from experiments made during different years. It can thus be shown that
1228,neither sterility nor fertility affords any clear distinction between
1228,species and varieties; but that the evidence from this source graduates
1228,"away, and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from"
1228,other constitutional and structural differences.
1228,
1228,In regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though
1228,"Gartner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from a"
1228,"cross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for"
1228,"ten generations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never"
1228,"increased, but generally greatly decreased. I do not doubt that this is"
1228,"usually the case, and that the fertility often suddenly decreases in"
1228,the first few generations. Nevertheless I believe that in all these
1228,"experiments the fertility has been diminished by an independent cause,"
1228,"namely, from close interbreeding. I have collected so large a body of"
1228,"facts, showing that close interbreeding lessens fertility, and, on"
1228,"the other hand, that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or"
1228,"variety increases fertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this"
1228,almost universal belief amongst breeders. Hybrids are seldom raised by
1228,"experimentalists in great numbers; and as the parent-species, or other"
1228,"allied hybrids, generally grow in the same garden, the visits of insects"
1228,must be carefully prevented during the flowering season: hence hybrids
1228,will generally be fertilised during each generation by their own
1228,individual pollen; and I am convinced that this would be injurious
1228,"to their fertility, already lessened by their hybrid origin. I am"
1228,strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly
1228,"made by Gartner, namely, that if even the less fertile hybrids be"
1228,"artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind, their"
1228,"fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of manipulation,"
1228,"sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing. Now, in"
1228,artificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance (as I know
1228,"from my own experience) from the anthers of another flower, as from the"
1228,anthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised; so that a cross
1228,"between two flowers, though probably on the same plant, would be thus"
1228,"effected. Moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in progress,"
1228,"so careful an observer as Gartner would have castrated his hybrids, and"
1228,this would have insured in each generation a cross with the pollen from
1228,"a distinct flower, either from the same plant or from another plant of"
1228,"the same hybrid nature. And thus, the strange fact of the increase"
1228,of fertility in the successive generations of ARTIFICIALLY FERTILISED
1228,"hybrids may, I believe, be accounted for by close interbreeding having"
1228,been avoided.
1228,
1228,Now let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most experienced
1228,"hybridiser, namely, the Honourable and Reverend W. Herbert. He is as"
1228,emphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile--as
1228,fertile as the pure parent-species--as are Kolreuter and Gartner that
1228,some degree of sterility between distinct species is a universal law
1228,of nature. He experimentised on some of the very same species as did
1228,"Gartner. The difference in their results may, I think, be in part"
1228,"accounted for by Herbert's great horticultural skill, and by his having"
1228,hothouses at his command. Of his many important statements I will here
1228,"give only a single one as an example, namely, that ""every ovule in a pod"
1228,"of Crinum capense fertilised by C. revolutum produced a plant, which"
1228,"(he says) I never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation."" So"
1228,"that we here have perfect, or even more than commonly perfect, fertility"
1228,in a first cross between two distinct species.
1228,
1228,"This case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact,"
1228,"namely, that there are individual plants, as with certain species of"
1228,"Lobelia, and with all the species of the genus Hippeastrum, which can"
1228,be far more easily fertilised by the pollen of another and distinct
1228,"species, than by their own pollen. For these plants have been found to"
1228,"yield seed to the pollen of a distinct species, though quite sterile"
1228,"with their own pollen, notwithstanding that their own pollen was found"
1228,"to be perfectly good, for it fertilised distinct species. So that"
1228,certain individual plants and all the individuals of certain species
1228,can actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be
1228,"self-fertilised! For instance, a bulb of Hippeastrum aulicum produced"
1228,"four flowers; three were fertilised by Herbert with their own pollen,"
1228,and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compound
1228,hybrid descended from three other and distinct species: the result was
1228,"that ""the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow, and"
1228,"after a few days perished entirely, whereas the pod impregnated by"
1228,the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid progress to
1228,"maturity, and bore good seed, which vegetated freely."" In a letter to"
1228,"me, in , Mr. Herbert told me that he had then tried the experiment"
1228,"during five years, and he continued to try it during several subsequent"
1228,"years, and always with the same result. This result has, also, been"
1228,confirmed by other observers in the case of Hippeastrum with its
1228,"sub-genera, and in the case of some other genera, as Lobelia, Passiflora"
1228,and Verbascum. Although the plants in these experiments appeared
1228,"perfectly healthy, and although both the ovules and pollen of the same"
1228,"flower were perfectly good with respect to other species, yet as they"
1228,"were functionally imperfect in their mutual self-action, we must infer"
1228,that the plants were in an unnatural state. Nevertheless these facts
1228,show on what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater
1228,"fertility of species when crossed, in comparison with the same species"
1228,"when self-fertilised, sometimes depends."
1228,
1228,"The practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with"
1228,"scientific precision, deserve some notice. It is notorious in how"
1228,"complicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia, Calceolaria,"
1228,"Petunia, Rhododendron, etc., have been crossed, yet many of these"
1228,"hybrids seed freely. For instance, Herbert asserts that a hybrid from"
1228,"Calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely dissimilar"
1228,"in general habit, ""reproduced itself as perfectly as if it had been a"
1228,"natural species from the mountains of Chile."" I have taken some pains"
1228,to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of
1228,"Rhododendrons, and I am assured that many of them are perfectly fertile."
1228,"Mr. C. Noble, for instance, informs me that he raises stocks for"
1228,"grafting from a hybrid between Rhododendron Ponticum and Catawbiense,"
1228,"and that this hybrid ""seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine."" Had"
1228,"hybrids, when fairly treated, gone on decreasing in fertility in each"
1228,"successive generation, as Gartner believes to be the case, the fact"
1228,would have been notorious to nurserymen. Horticulturists raise large
1228,"beds of the same hybrids, and such alone are fairly treated, for by"
1228,insect agency the several individuals of the same hybrid variety are
1228,"allowed to freely cross with each other, and the injurious influence"
1228,of close interbreeding is thus prevented. Any one may readily convince
1228,himself of the efficiency of insect-agency by examining the flowers of
1228,"the more sterile kinds of hybrid rhododendrons, which produce no pollen,"
1228,for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other
1228,flowers.
1228,
1228,"In regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully tried"
1228,"than with plants. If our systematic arrangements can be trusted, that"
1228,"is if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other, as are the"
1228,"genera of plants, then we may infer that animals more widely separated"
1228,in the scale of nature can be more easily crossed than in the case of
1228,"plants; but the hybrids themselves are, I think, more sterile. I doubt"
1228,whether any case of a perfectly fertile hybrid animal can be considered
1228,"as thoroughly well authenticated. It should, however, be borne in"
1228,"mind that, owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement, few"
1228,"experiments have been fairly tried: for instance, the canary-bird has"
1228,"been crossed with nine other finches, but as not one of these nine"
1228,"species breeds freely in confinement, we have no right to expect that"
1228,"the first crosses between them and the canary, or that their hybrids,"
1228,"should be perfectly fertile. Again, with respect to the fertility in"
1228,"successive generations of the more fertile hybrid animals, I hardly know"
1228,of an instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised
1228,"at the same time from different parents, so as to avoid the ill effects"
1228,"of close interbreeding. On the contrary, brothers and sisters have"
1228,"usually been crossed in each successive generation, in opposition to the"
1228,"constantly repeated admonition of every breeder. And in this case, it is"
1228,not at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should
1228,"have gone on increasing. If we were to act thus, and pair brothers and"
1228,"sisters in the case of any pure animal, which from any cause had the"
1228,"least tendency to sterility, the breed would assuredly be lost in a very"
1228,few generations.
1228,
1228,Although I do not know of any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of
1228,"perfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have some reason to believe that"
1228,"the hybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii, and from Phasianus"
1228,colchicus with P. torquatus and with P. versicolor are perfectly
1228,"fertile. The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A. cygnoides),"
1228,species which are so different that they are generally ranked in
1228,"distinct genera, have often bred in this country with either pure"
1228,"parent, and in one single instance they have bred inter se. This was"
1228,"effected by Mr. Eyton, who raised two hybrids from the same parents but"
1228,from different hatches; and from these two birds he raised no less than
1228,"eight hybrids (grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. In India,"
1228,"however, these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am"
1228,"assured by two eminently capable judges, namely Mr. Blyth and Capt."
1228,"Hutton, that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various"
1228,"parts of the country; and as they are kept for profit, where neither"
1228,"pure parent-species exists, they must certainly be highly fertile."
1228,
1228,"A doctrine which originated with Pallas, has been largely accepted"
1228,"by modern naturalists; namely, that most of our domestic animals have"
1228,"descended from two or more aboriginal species, since commingled by"
1228,"intercrossing. On this view, the aboriginal species must either at first"
1228,"have produced quite fertile hybrids, or the hybrids must have become in"
1228,subsequent generations quite fertile under domestication. This latter
1228,"alternative seems to me the most probable, and I am inclined to believe"
1228,"in its truth, although it rests on no direct evidence. I believe, for"
1228,"instance, that our dogs have descended from several wild stocks; yet,"
1228,with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of South
1228,"America, all are quite fertile together; and analogy makes me greatly"
1228,"doubt, whether the several aboriginal species would at first have freely"
1228,bred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids. So again there
1228,is reason to believe that our European and the humped Indian cattle are
1228,"quite fertile together; but from facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth,"
1228,I think they must be considered as distinct species. On this view of
1228,"the origin of many of our domestic animals, we must either give up the"
1228,belief of the almost universal sterility of distinct species of
1228,"animals when crossed; or we must look at sterility, not as an indelible"
1228,"characteristic, but as one capable of being removed by domestication."
1228,
1228,"Finally, looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of"
1228,"plants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of sterility,"
1228,"both in first crosses and in hybrids, is an extremely general result;"
1228,"but that it cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered"
1228,as absolutely universal.
1228,
1228,LAWS GOVERNING THE STERILITY OF FIRST CROSSES AND OF HYBRIDS.
1228,
1228,We will now consider a little more in detail the circumstances and
1228,rules governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. Our chief
1228,object will be to see whether or not the rules indicate that species
1228,"have specially been endowed with this quality, in order to prevent their"
1228,crossing and blending together in utter confusion. The following rules
1228,and conclusions are chiefly drawn up from Gartner's admirable work on
1228,the hybridisation of plants. I have taken much pains to ascertain how
1228,"far the rules apply to animals, and considering how scanty our knowledge"
1228,"is in regard to hybrid animals, I have been surprised to find how"
1228,generally the same rules apply to both kingdoms.
1228,
1228,"It has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of"
1228,"first crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect fertility."
1228,It is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown to
1228,exist; but only the barest outline of the facts can here be given. When
1228,pollen from a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of
1228,"a distinct family, it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic"
1228,"dust. From this absolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different"
1228,"species of the same genus applied to the stigma of some one species,"
1228,"yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced, up to nearly"
1228,"complete or even quite complete fertility; and, as we have seen, in"
1228,"certain abnormal cases, even to an excess of fertility, beyond that"
1228,"which the plant's own pollen will produce. So in hybrids themselves,"
1228,"there are some which never have produced, and probably never would"
1228,"produce, even with the pollen of either pure parent, a single fertile"
1228,seed: but in some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be
1228,"detected, by the pollen of one of the pure parent-species causing the"
1228,flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have
1228,done; and the early withering of the flower is well known to be a sign
1228,of incipient fertilisation. From this extreme degree of sterility we
1228,have self-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of
1228,seeds up to perfect fertility.
1228,
1228,"Hybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross, and which"
1228,"rarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but the"
1228,"parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the"
1228,sterility of the hybrids thus produced--two classes of facts which are
1228,generally confounded together--is by no means strict. There are many
1228,"cases, in which two pure species can be united with unusual facility,"
1228,"and produce numerous hybrid-offspring, yet these hybrids are remarkably"
1228,"sterile. On the other hand, there are species which can be crossed"
1228,"very rarely, or with extreme difficulty, but the hybrids, when at last"
1228,"produced, are very fertile. Even within the limits of the same genus,"
1228,"for instance in Dianthus, these two opposite cases occur."
1228,
1228,"The fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more easily"
1228,"affected by unfavourable conditions, than is the fertility of pure"
1228,species. But the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable; for
1228,it is not always the same when the same two species are crossed under
1228,"the same circumstances, but depends in part upon the constitution of the"
1228,individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment. So it
1228,"is with hybrids, for their degree of fertility is often found to differ"
1228,greatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the same
1228,capsule and exposed to exactly the same conditions.
1228,
1228,"By the term systematic affinity is meant, the resemblance between"
1228,"species in structure and in constitution, more especially in the"
1228,structure of parts which are of high physiological importance and which
1228,differ little in the allied species. Now the fertility of first crosses
1228,"between species, and of the hybrids produced from them, is largely"
1228,governed by their systematic affinity. This is clearly shown by hybrids
1228,never having been raised between species ranked by systematists in
1228,"distinct families; and on the other hand, by very closely allied"
1228,species generally uniting with facility. But the correspondence between
1228,systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict.
1228,A multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species which
1228,"will not unite, or only with extreme difficulty; and on the other hand"
1228,of very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility. In
1228,"the same family there may be a genus, as Dianthus, in which very many"
1228,"species can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as Silene,"
1228,in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between
1228,extremely close species a single hybrid. Even within the limits of the
1228,"same genus, we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many"
1228,species of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of
1228,"almost any other genus; but Gartner found that N. acuminata, which is"
1228,"not a particularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or"
1228,"to be fertilised by, no less than eight other species of Nicotiana. Very"
1228,many analogous facts could be given.
1228,
1228,"No one has been able to point out what kind, or what amount, of"
1228,difference in any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent two
1228,species crossing. It can be shown that plants most widely different in
1228,"habit and general appearance, and having strongly marked differences in"
1228,"every part of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in the"
1228,"cotyledons, can be crossed. Annual and perennial plants, deciduous and"
1228,"evergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for"
1228,"extremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease."
1228,
1228,"By a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for"
1228,"instance, of a stallion-horse being first crossed with a female-ass, and"
1228,then a male-ass with a mare: these two species may then be said to have
1228,been reciprocally crossed. There is often the widest possible difference
1228,in the facility of making reciprocal crosses. Such cases are highly
1228,"important, for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross"
1228,"is often completely independent of their systematic affinity, or of any"
1228,"recognisable difference in their whole organisation. On the other hand,"
1228,these cases clearly show that the capacity for crossing is connected
1228,"with constitutional differences imperceptible by us, and confined to the"
1228,reproductive system. This difference in the result of reciprocal crosses
1228,between the same two species was long ago observed by Kolreuter. To give
1228,an instance: Mirabilis jalappa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of
1228,"M. longiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile;"
1228,"but Kolreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight following"
1228,"years, to fertilise reciprocally M. longiflora with the pollen of M."
1228,"jalappa, and utterly failed. Several other equally striking cases could"
1228,be given. Thuret has observed the same fact with certain sea-weeds
1228,"or Fuci. Gartner, moreover, found that this difference of facility in"
1228,making reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree. He has
1228,observed it even between forms so closely related (as Matthiola annua
1228,and glabra) that many botanists rank them only as varieties. It is also
1228,"a remarkable fact, that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though"
1228,"of course compounded of the very same two species, the one species"
1228,"having first been used as the father and then as the mother, generally"
1228,"differ in fertility in a small, and occasionally in a high degree."
1228,
1228,"Several other singular rules could be given from Gartner: for instance,"
1228,some species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species;
1228,other species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing
1228,their likeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two powers do not at
1228,all necessarily go together. There are certain hybrids which instead
1228,"of having, as is usual, an intermediate character between their two"
1228,"parents, always closely resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though"
1228,"externally so like one of their pure parent-species, are with rare"
1228,exceptions extremely sterile. So again amongst hybrids which are
1228,"usually intermediate in structure between their parents, exceptional and"
1228,"abnormal individuals sometimes are born, which closely resemble one of"
1228,"their pure parents; and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile,"
1228,even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have
1228,a considerable degree of fertility. These facts show how completely
1228,fertility in the hybrid is independent of its external resemblance to
1228,either pure parent.
1228,
1228,"Considering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility"
1228,"of first crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be"
1228,"considered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility"
1228,"graduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under"
1228,"certain conditions in excess. That their fertility, besides being"
1228,"eminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is"
1228,innately variable. That it is by no means always the same in degree in
1228,the first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross. That the
1228,fertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble
1228,"in external appearance either parent. And lastly, that the facility of"
1228,making a first cross between any two species is not always governed by
1228,their systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other. This
1228,latter statement is clearly proved by reciprocal crosses between the
1228,"same two species, for according as the one species or the other is used"
1228,"as the father or the mother, there is generally some difference,"
1228,"and occasionally the widest possible difference, in the facility of"
1228,"effecting an union. The hybrids, moreover, produced from reciprocal"
1228,crosses often differ in fertility.
1228,
1228,Now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been
1228,endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded
1228,in nature? I think not. For why should the sterility be so extremely
1228,"different in degree, when various species are crossed, all of which"
1228,we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending
1228,together? Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in
1228,the individuals of the same species? Why should some species cross with
1228,"facility, and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and other species cross"
1228,"with extreme difficulty, and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids?"
1228,Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a
1228,"reciprocal cross between the same two species? Why, it may even be"
1228,"asked, has the production of hybrids been permitted? to grant to species"
1228,"the special power of producing hybrids, and then to stop their further"
1228,"propagation by different degrees of sterility, not strictly related to"
1228,"the facility of the first union between their parents, seems to be a"
1228,strange arrangement.
1228,
1228,"The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me clearly"
1228,to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids is
1228,"simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences, chiefly in the"
1228,"reproductive systems, of the species which are crossed. The differences"
1228,"being of so peculiar and limited a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses"
1228,between two species the male sexual element of the one will often freely
1228,"act on the female sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed"
1228,direction. It will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an
1228,"example what I mean by sterility being incidental on other differences,"
1228,and not a specially endowed quality. As the capacity of one plant to be
1228,grafted or budded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfare
1228,"in a state of nature, I presume that no one will suppose that this"
1228,"capacity is a SPECIALLY endowed quality, but will admit that it is"
1228,incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants. We
1228,"can sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another, from"
1228,"differences in their rate of growth, in the hardness of their wood, in"
1228,"the period of the flow or nature of their sap, etc.; but in a multitude"
1228,of cases we can assign no reason whatever. Great diversity in the size
1228,"of two plants, one being woody and the other herbaceous, one being"
1228,"evergreen and the other deciduous, and adaptation to widely different"
1228,"climates, does not always prevent the two grafting together. As in"
1228,"hybridisation, so with grafting, the capacity is limited by systematic"
1228,"affinity, for no one has been able to graft trees together belonging to"
1228,"quite distinct families; and, on the other hand, closely allied species,"
1228,"and varieties of the same species, can usually, but not invariably,"
1228,"be grafted with ease. But this capacity, as in hybridisation, is by no"
1228,means absolutely governed by systematic affinity. Although many distinct
1228,"genera within the same family have been grafted together, in other cases"
1228,species of the same genus will not take on each other. The pear can be
1228,"grafted far more readily on the quince, which is ranked as a distinct"
1228,"genus, than on the apple, which is a member of the same genus. Even"
1228,different varieties of the pear take with different degrees of facility
1228,on the quince; so do different varieties of the apricot and peach on
1228,certain varieties of the plum.
1228,
1228,As Gartner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in
1228,different INDIVIDUALS of the same two species in crossing; so Sagaret
1228,believes this to be the case with different individuals of the same
1228,"two species in being grafted together. As in reciprocal crosses, the"
1228,"facility of effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it"
1228,"sometimes is in grafting; the common gooseberry, for instance, cannot"
1228,"be grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with"
1228,"difficulty, on the gooseberry."
1228,
1228,"We have seen that the sterility of hybrids, which have their"
1228,"reproductive organs in an imperfect condition, is a very different"
1228,"case from the difficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their"
1228,reproductive organs perfect; yet these two distinct cases run to a
1228,certain extent parallel. Something analogous occurs in grafting; for
1228,"Thouin found that three species of Robinia, which seeded freely on"
1228,"their own roots, and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on"
1228,"another species, when thus grafted were rendered barren. On the other"
1228,"hand, certain species of Sorbus, when grafted on other species, yielded"
1228,twice as much fruit as when on their own roots. We are reminded by this
1228,"latter fact of the extraordinary case of Hippeastrum, Lobelia, etc.,"
1228,which seeded much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of
1228,"distinct species, than when self-fertilised with their own pollen."
1228,
1228,"We thus see, that although there is a clear and fundamental difference"
1228,"between the mere adhesion of grafted stocks, and the union of the male"
1228,"and female elements in the act of reproduction, yet that there is a"
1228,rude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing
1228,distinct species. And as we must look at the curious and complex laws
1228,governing the facility with which trees can be grafted on each other
1228,"as incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so I"
1228,believe that the still more complex laws governing the facility of
1228,"first crosses, are incidental on unknown differences, chiefly in their"
1228,"reproductive systems. These differences, in both cases, follow to a"
1228,"certain extent, as might have been expected, systematic affinity, by"
1228,which every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organic
1228,beings is attempted to be expressed. The facts by no means seem to me
1228,to indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or
1228,crossing together various species has been a special endowment;
1228,"although in the case of crossing, the difficulty is as important for the"
1228,"endurance and stability of specific forms, as in the case of grafting it"
1228,is unimportant for their welfare.
1228,
1228,CAUSES OF THE STERILITY OF FIRST CROSSES AND OF HYBRIDS.
1228,
1228,We may now look a little closer at the probable causes of the sterility
1228,of first crosses and of hybrids. These two cases are fundamentally
1228,"different, for, as just remarked, in the union of two pure species the"
1228,"male and female sexual elements are perfect, whereas in hybrids they are"
1228,"imperfect. Even in first crosses, the greater or lesser difficulty in"
1228,effecting a union apparently depends on several distinct causes. There
1228,must sometimes be a physical impossibility in the male element reaching
1228,"the ovule, as would be the case with a plant having a pistil too long"
1228,for the pollen-tubes to reach the ovarium. It has also been observed
1228,that when pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of a distantly
1228,"allied species, though the pollen-tubes protrude, they do not penetrate"
1228,"the stigmatic surface. Again, the male element may reach the female"
1228,"element, but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed, as seems"
1228,to have been the case with some of Thuret's experiments on Fuci. No
1228,"explanation can be given of these facts, any more than why certain trees"
1228,"cannot be grafted on others. Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and"
1228,then perish at an early period. This latter alternative has not been
1228,"sufficiently attended to; but I believe, from observations communicated"
1228,"to me by Mr. Hewitt, who has had great experience in hybridising"
1228,"gallinaceous birds, that the early death of the embryo is a very"
1228,frequent cause of sterility in first crosses. I was at first very
1228,"unwilling to believe in this view; as hybrids, when once born, are"
1228,"generally healthy and long-lived, as we see in the case of the common"
1228,"mule. Hybrids, however, are differently circumstanced before and after"
1228,birth: when born and living in a country where their two parents can
1228,"live, they are generally placed under suitable conditions of life. But"
1228,a hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its
1228,"mother, and therefore before birth, as long as it is nourished within"
1228,"its mother's womb or within the egg or seed produced by the mother, it"
1228,"may be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently"
1228,be liable to perish at an early period; more especially as all very
1228,young beings seem eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural
1228,conditions of life.
1228,
1228,"In regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are"
1228,"imperfectly developed, the case is very different. I have more than once"
1228,"alluded to a large body of facts, which I have collected, showing that"
1228,"when animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions,"
1228,they are extremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously
1228,"affected. This, in fact, is the great bar to the domestication of"
1228,"animals. Between the sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids,"
1228,there are many points of similarity. In both cases the sterility is
1228,"independent of general health, and is often accompanied by excess of"
1228,"size or great luxuriance. In both cases, the sterility occurs in various"
1228,"degrees; in both, the male element is the most liable to be affected;"
1228,"but sometimes the female more than the male. In both, the tendency"
1228,"goes to a certain extent with systematic affinity, for whole groups"
1228,of animals and plants are rendered impotent by the same unnatural
1228,conditions; and whole groups of species tend to produce sterile hybrids.
1228,"On the other hand, one species in a group will sometimes resist great"
1228,changes of conditions with unimpaired fertility; and certain species in
1228,"a group will produce unusually fertile hybrids. No one can tell, till he"
1228,"tries, whether any particular animal will breed under confinement or any"
1228,"plant seed freely under culture; nor can he tell, till he tries, whether"
1228,any two species of a genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids.
1228,"Lastly, when organic beings are placed during several generations under"
1228,"conditions not natural to them, they are extremely liable to vary,"
1228,"which is due, as I believe, to their reproductive systems having been"
1228,"specially affected, though in a lesser degree than when sterility"
1228,"ensues. So it is with hybrids, for hybrids in successive generations are"
1228,"eminently liable to vary, as every experimentalist has observed."
1228,
1228,Thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural
1228,"conditions, and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing of"
1228,"two species, the reproductive system, independently of the general state"
1228,"of health, is affected by sterility in a very similar manner. In the"
1228,"one case, the conditions of life have been disturbed, though often in so"
1228,"slight a degree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case, or"
1228,"that of hybrids, the external conditions have remained the same, but"
1228,the organisation has been disturbed by two different structures and
1228,constitutions having been blended into one. For it is scarcely possible
1228,"that two organisations should be compounded into one, without some"
1228,"disturbance occurring in the development, or periodical action, or"
1228,"mutual relation of the different parts and organs one to another, or to"
1228,"the conditions of life. When hybrids are able to breed inter se, they"
1228,transmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same
1228,"compounded organisation, and hence we need not be surprised that their"
1228,"sterility, though in some degree variable, rarely diminishes."
1228,
1228,"It must, however, be confessed that we cannot understand, excepting"
1228,"on vague hypotheses, several facts with respect to the sterility of"
1228,"hybrids; for instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from"
1228,reciprocal crosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which
1228,occasionally and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent. Nor
1228,do I pretend that the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter:
1228,"no explanation is offered why an organism, when placed under unnatural"
1228,"conditions, is rendered sterile. All that I have attempted to show,"
1228,"is that in two cases, in some respects allied, sterility is the common"
1228,"result,--in the one case from the conditions of life having been"
1228,"disturbed, in the other case from the organisation having been disturbed"
1228,by two organisations having been compounded into one.
1228,
1228,"It may seem fanciful, but I suspect that a similar parallelism extends"
1228,to an allied yet very different class of facts. It is an old and almost
1228,"universal belief, founded, I think, on a considerable body of evidence,"
1228,that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all
1228,living things. We see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their
1228,"frequent exchanges of seed, tubers, etc., from one soil or climate to"
1228,"another, and back again. During the convalescence of animals, we plainly"
1228,see that great benefit is derived from almost any change in the
1228,"habits of life. Again, both with plants and animals, there is abundant"
1228,"evidence, that a cross between very distinct individuals of the same"
1228,"species, that is between members of different strains or sub-breeds,"
1228,"gives vigour and fertility to the offspring. I believe, indeed, from"
1228,"the facts alluded to in our fourth chapter, that a certain amount of"
1228,crossing is indispensable even with hermaphrodites; and that close
1228,interbreeding continued during several generations between the nearest
1228,"relations, especially if these be kept under the same conditions of"
1228,"life, always induces weakness and sterility in the progeny."
1228,
1228,"Hence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions"
1228,"of life benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand, that slight"
1228,"crosses, that is crosses between the males and females of the same"
1228,"species which have varied and become slightly different, give vigour and"
1228,"fertility to the offspring. But we have seen that greater changes, or"
1228,"changes of a particular nature, often render organic beings in some"
1228,"degree sterile; and that greater crosses, that is crosses between males"
1228,"and females which have become widely or specifically different, produce"
1228,hybrids which are generally sterile in some degree. I cannot persuade
1228,myself that this parallelism is an accident or an illusion. Both series
1228,"of facts seem to be connected together by some common but unknown bond,"
1228,which is essentially related to the principle of life.
1228,
1228,"FERTILITY OF VARIETIES WHEN CROSSED, AND OF THEIR MONGREL OFFSPRING."
1228,
1228,"It may be urged, as a most forcible argument, that there must be some"
1228,"essential distinction between species and varieties, and that there"
1228,"must be some error in all the foregoing remarks, inasmuch as varieties,"
1228,"however much they may differ from each other in external appearance,"
1228,"cross with perfect facility, and yield perfectly fertile offspring. I"
1228,fully admit that this is almost invariably the case. But if we look to
1228,"varieties produced under nature, we are immediately involved in hopeless"
1228,difficulties; for if two hitherto reputed varieties be found in any
1228,"degree sterile together, they are at once ranked by most naturalists"
1228,"as species. For instance, the blue and red pimpernel, the primrose"
1228,"and cowslip, which are considered by many of our best botanists as"
1228,"varieties, are said by Gartner not to be quite fertile when crossed, and"
1228,he consequently ranks them as undoubted species. If we thus argue in
1228,"a circle, the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will"
1228,assuredly have to be granted.
1228,
1228,"If we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been produced,"
1228,"under domestication, we are still involved in doubt. For when it is"
1228,"stated, for instance, that the German Spitz dog unites more easily"
1228,"than other dogs with foxes, or that certain South American indigenous"
1228,"domestic dogs do not readily cross with European dogs, the explanation"
1228,"which will occur to everyone, and probably the true one, is that"
1228,these dogs have descended from several aboriginally distinct species.
1228,"Nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic varieties,"
1228,"differing widely from each other in appearance, for instance of the"
1228,"pigeon or of the cabbage, is a remarkable fact; more especially when we"
1228,"reflect how many species there are, which, though resembling each"
1228,"other most closely, are utterly sterile when intercrossed. Several"
1228,"considerations, however, render the fertility of domestic varieties less"
1228,"remarkable than at first appears. It can, in the first place, be clearly"
1228,shown that mere external dissimilarity between two species does not
1228,determine their greater or lesser degree of sterility when crossed; and
1228,"we may apply the same rule to domestic varieties. In the second place,"
1228,some eminent naturalists believe that a long course of domestication
1228,"tends to eliminate sterility in the successive generations of hybrids,"
1228,"which were at first only slightly sterile; and if this be so, we surely"
1228,ought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and disappearing
1228,"under nearly the same conditions of life. Lastly, and this seems to me"
1228,"by far the most important consideration, new races of animals and plants"
1228,are produced under domestication by man's methodical and unconscious
1228,"power of selection, for his own use and pleasure: he neither wishes to"
1228,"select, nor could select, slight differences in the reproductive system,"
1228,or other constitutional differences correlated with the reproductive
1228,system. He supplies his several varieties with the same food; treats
1228,"them in nearly the same manner, and does not wish to alter their general"
1228,habits of life. Nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast periods
1228,"of time on the whole organisation, in any way which may be for each"
1228,"creature's own good; and thus she may, either directly, or more probably"
1228,"indirectly, through correlation, modify the reproductive system in the"
1228,several descendants from any one species. Seeing this difference in the
1228,"process of selection, as carried on by man and nature, we need not be"
1228,surprised at some difference in the result.
1228,
1228,I have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were
1228,invariably fertile when intercrossed. But it seems to me impossible to
1228,resist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in
1228,"the few following cases, which I will briefly abstract. The evidence"
1228,is at least as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of
1228,"a multitude of species. The evidence is, also, derived from hostile"
1228,"witnesses, who in all other cases consider fertility and sterility as"
1228,safe criterions of specific distinction. Gartner kept during several
1228,"years a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with"
1228,"red seeds, growing near each other in his garden; and although these"
1228,"plants have separated sexes, they never naturally crossed. He then"
1228,fertilised thirteen flowers of the one with the pollen of the other; but
1228,"only a single head produced any seed, and this one head produced only"
1228,"five grains. Manipulation in this case could not have been injurious, as"
1228,"the plants have separated sexes. No one, I believe, has suspected that"
1228,these varieties of maize are distinct species; and it is important to
1228,notice that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves PERFECTLY
1228,fertile; so that even Gartner did not venture to consider the two
1228,varieties as specifically distinct.
1228,
1228,"Girou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like"
1228,"the maize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual"
1228,fertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences are
1228,"greater. How far these experiments may be trusted, I know not; but the"
1228,"forms experimentised on, are ranked by Sagaret, who mainly founds his"
1228,"classification by the test of infertility, as varieties."
1228,
1228,"The following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first quite"
1228,incredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments
1228,"made during many years on nine species of Verbascum, by so good an"
1228,"observer and so hostile a witness, as Gartner: namely, that yellow"
1228,and white varieties of the same species of Verbascum when intercrossed
1228,"produce less seed, than do either coloured varieties when fertilised"
1228,"with pollen from their own coloured flowers. Moreover, he asserts that"
1228,when yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow
1228,"and white varieties of a DISTINCT species, more seed is produced by the"
1228,"crosses between the same coloured flowers, than between those which are"
1228,differently coloured. Yet these varieties of Verbascum present no other
1228,difference besides the mere colour of the flower; and one variety can
1228,sometimes be raised from the seed of the other.
1228,
1228,"From observations which I have made on certain varieties of hollyhock, I"
1228,am inclined to suspect that they present analogous facts.
1228,
1228,"Kolreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent"
1228,"observer, has proved the remarkable fact, that one variety of the common"
1228,"tobacco is more fertile, when crossed with a widely distinct species,"
1228,"than are the other varieties. He experimentised on five forms, which are"
1228,"commonly reputed to be varieties, and which he tested by the severest"
1228,"trial, namely, by reciprocal crosses, and he found their mongrel"
1228,"offspring perfectly fertile. But one of these five varieties, when used"
1228,"either as father or mother, and crossed with the Nicotiana glutinosa,"
1228,always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were produced
1228,from the four other varieties when crossed with N. glutinosa. Hence the
1228,reproductive system of this one variety must have been in some manner
1228,and in some degree modified.
1228,
1228,From these facts; from the great difficulty of ascertaining the
1228,"infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a supposed variety if"
1228,infertile in any degree would generally be ranked as species; from
1228,man selecting only external characters in the production of the most
1228,"distinct domestic varieties, and from not wishing or being able to"
1228,produce recondite and functional differences in the reproductive system;
1228,"from these several considerations and facts, I do not think that the"
1228,very general fertility of varieties can be proved to be of universal
1228,"occurrence, or to form a fundamental distinction between varieties"
1228,and species. The general fertility of varieties does not seem to me
1228,sufficient to overthrow the view which I have taken with respect to
1228,"the very general, but not invariable, sterility of first crosses and of"
1228,"hybrids, namely, that it is not a special endowment, but is incidental"
1228,"on slowly acquired modifications, more especially in the reproductive"
1228,systems of the forms which are crossed.
1228,
1228,"HYBRIDS AND MONGRELS COMPARED, INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR FERTILITY."
1228,
1228,"Independently of the question of fertility, the offspring of species"
1228,when crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several
1228,"other respects. Gartner, whose strong wish was to draw a marked line of"
1228,"distinction between species and varieties, could find very few and,"
1228,"as it seems to me, quite unimportant differences between the so-called"
1228,"hybrid offspring of species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of"
1228,"varieties. And, on the other hand, they agree most closely in very many"
1228,important respects.
1228,
1228,I shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. The most
1228,"important distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are"
1228,more variable than hybrids; but Gartner admits that hybrids from
1228,species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first
1228,generation; and I have myself seen striking instances of this fact.
1228,Gartner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species
1228,are more variable than those from very distinct species; and this shows
1228,that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away.
1228,When mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several
1228,generations an extreme amount of variability in their offspring
1228,is notorious; but some few cases both of hybrids and mongrels long
1228,"retaining uniformity of character could be given. The variability,"
1228,"however, in the successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater"
1228,than in hybrids.
1228,
1228,This greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem to me
1228,"at all surprising. For the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly"
1228,domestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on natural
1228,"varieties), and this implies in most cases that there has been recent"
1228,variability; and therefore we might expect that such variability would
1228,often continue and be super-added to that arising from the mere act of
1228,crossing. The slight degree of variability in hybrids from the first
1228,"cross or in the first generation, in contrast with their extreme"
1228,"variability in the succeeding generations, is a curious fact and"
1228,deserves attention. For it bears on and corroborates the view which I
1228,"have taken on the cause of ordinary variability; namely, that it is due"
1228,to the reproductive system being eminently sensitive to any change in
1228,"the conditions of life, being thus often rendered either impotent or at"
1228,least incapable of its proper function of producing offspring identical
1228,with the parent-form. Now hybrids in the first generation are descended
1228,from species (excluding those long cultivated) which have not had their
1228,"reproductive systems in any way affected, and they are not variable; but"
1228,"hybrids themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected,"
1228,and their descendants are highly variable.
1228,
1228,But to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids: Gartner
1228,states that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either
1228,"parent-form; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in"
1228,"degree. Gartner further insists that when any two species, although"
1228,"most closely allied to each other, are crossed with a third species,"
1228,the hybrids are widely different from each other; whereas if two very
1228,"distinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species, the"
1228,"hybrids do not differ much. But this conclusion, as far as I can make"
1228,"out, is founded on a single experiment; and seems directly opposed to"
1228,the results of several experiments made by Kolreuter.
1228,
1228,"These alone are the unimportant differences, which Gartner is able to"
1228,"point out, between hybrid and mongrel plants. On the other hand, the"
1228,"resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents,"
1228,"more especially in hybrids produced from nearly related species, follows"
1228,"according to Gartner the same laws. When two species are crossed,"
1228,one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing its likeness on the
1228,hybrid; and so I believe it to be with varieties of plants. With animals
1228,one variety certainly often has this prepotent power over another
1228,"variety. Hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal cross, generally"
1228,resemble each other closely; and so it is with mongrels from a
1228,reciprocal cross. Both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced to either
1228,"pure parent-form, by repeated crosses in successive generations with"
1228,either parent.
1228,
1228,These several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the
1228,"subject is here excessively complicated, partly owing to the existence"
1228,of secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency
1228,in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the
1228,"other, both when one species is crossed with another, and when one"
1228,"variety is crossed with another variety. For instance, I think those"
1228,"authors are right, who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over"
1228,"the horse, so that both the mule and the hinny more resemble the ass"
1228,than the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the
1228,"male-ass than in the female, so that the mule, which is the offspring of"
1228,"the male-ass and mare, is more like an ass, than is the hinny, which is"
1228,the offspring of the female-ass and stallion.
1228,
1228,"Much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that"
1228,mongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents; but
1228,it can be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids; yet I grant
1228,much less frequently with hybrids than with mongrels. Looking to the
1228,cases which I have collected of cross-bred animals closely resembling
1228,"one parent, the resemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost"
1228,"monstrous in their nature, and which have suddenly appeared--such as"
1228,"albinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or horns, or additional fingers"
1228,and toes; and do not relate to characters which have been slowly
1228,"acquired by selection. Consequently, sudden reversions to the perfect"
1228,"character of either parent would be more likely to occur with mongrels,"
1228,which are descended from varieties often suddenly produced and
1228,"semi-monstrous in character, than with hybrids, which are descended from"
1228,species slowly and naturally produced. On the whole I entirely agree
1228,"with Dr. Prosper Lucas, who, after arranging an enormous body of facts"
1228,"with respect to animals, comes to the conclusion, that the laws of"
1228,"resemblance of the child to its parents are the same, whether the two"
1228,"parents differ much or little from each other, namely in the union"
1228,"of individuals of the same variety, or of different varieties, or of"
1228,distinct species.
1228,
1228,"Laying aside the question of fertility and sterility, in all other"
1228,respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the
1228,"offspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties. If we look at"
1228,"species as having been specially created, and at varieties as having"
1228,"been produced by secondary laws, this similarity would be an astonishing"
1228,fact. But it harmonises perfectly with the view that there is no
1228,essential distinction between species and varieties.
1228,
1228,SUMMARY OF CHAPTER.
1228,
1228,First crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to be ranked as
1228,"species, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not universally,"
1228,"sterile. The sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight that"
1228,"the two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived, have come to"
1228,diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test. The
1228,"sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species, and"
1228,is eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions. The
1228,"degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but is"
1228,"governed by several curious and complex laws. It is generally different,"
1228,"and sometimes widely different, in reciprocal crosses between the same"
1228,two species. It is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in
1228,the hybrid produced from this cross.
1228,
1228,"In the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity of one species"
1228,"or variety to take on another, is incidental on generally unknown"
1228,"differences in their vegetative systems, so in crossing, the greater"
1228,"or less facility of one species to unite with another, is incidental"
1228,on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. There is no more
1228,reason to think that species have been specially endowed with various
1228,"degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and blending in nature,"
1228,than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and
1228,somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in
1228,order to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests.
1228,
1228,"The sterility of first crosses between pure species, which have their"
1228,"reproductive systems perfect, seems to depend on several circumstances;"
1228,in some cases largely on the early death of the embryo. The sterility of
1228,"hybrids, which have their reproductive systems imperfect, and which"
1228,have had this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being
1228,"compounded of two distinct species, seems closely allied to that"
1228,"sterility which so frequently affects pure species, when their natural"
1228,conditions of life have been disturbed. This view is supported by a
1228,"parallelism of another kind;--namely, that the crossing of forms only"
1228,slightly different is favourable to the vigour and fertility of their
1228,offspring; and that slight changes in the conditions of life are
1228,apparently favourable to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings.
1228,It is not surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting two
1228,"species, and the degree of sterility of their hybrid-offspring should"
1228,"generally correspond, though due to distinct causes; for both depend"
1228,on the amount of difference of some kind between the species which are
1228,crossed. Nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a first
1228,"cross, the fertility of the hybrids produced, and the capacity of being"
1228,grafted together--though this latter capacity evidently depends on
1228,"widely different circumstances--should all run, to a certain extent,"
1228,parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which are subjected
1228,to experiment; for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds of
1228,resemblance between all species.
1228,
1228,"First crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently alike"
1228,"to be considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are very"
1228,"generally, but not quite universally, fertile. Nor is this nearly"
1228,"general and perfect fertility surprising, when we remember how liable we"
1228,are to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature;
1228,and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have
1228,been produced under domestication by the selection of mere external
1228,"differences, and not of differences in the reproductive system. In"
1228,"all other respects, excluding fertility, there is a close general"
1228,"resemblance between hybrids and mongrels. Finally, then, the facts"
1228,"briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even"
1228,"rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction"
1228,between species and varieties.

1228,
1228,. ON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD.
1228,
1228,On the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day. On the
1228,nature of extinct intermediate varieties; on their number. On the
1228,"vast lapse of time, as inferred from the rate of deposition and of"
1228,denudation. On the poorness of our palaeontological collections. On the
1228,intermittence of geological formations. On the absence of intermediate
1228,varieties in any one formation. On the sudden appearance of groups of
1228,species. On their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous
1228,strata.
1228,
1228,In the sixth chapter I enumerated the chief objections which might be
1228,justly urged against the views maintained in this volume. Most of them
1228,"have now been discussed. One, namely the distinctness of specific forms,"
1228,"and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links,"
1228,is a very obvious difficulty. I assigned reasons why such links do not
1228,"commonly occur at the present day, under the circumstances apparently"
1228,"most favourable for their presence, namely on an extensive and"
1228,continuous area with graduated physical conditions. I endeavoured to
1228,"show, that the life of each species depends in a more important manner"
1228,"on the presence of other already defined organic forms, than on climate;"
1228,"and, therefore, that the really governing conditions of life do not"
1228,"graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture. I endeavoured,"
1228,"also, to show that intermediate varieties, from existing in lesser"
1228,"numbers than the forms which they connect, will generally be beaten"
1228,out and exterminated during the course of further modification and
1228,"improvement. The main cause, however, of innumerable intermediate links"
1228,not now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends on the very
1228,"process of natural selection, through which new varieties continually"
1228,take the places of and exterminate their parent-forms. But just in
1228,proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous
1228,"scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have"
1228,"formerly existed on the earth, be truly enormous. Why then is not every"
1228,geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links?
1228,Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic
1228,"chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection"
1228,"which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I"
1228,"believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record."
1228,
1228,In the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort of
1228,"intermediate forms must, on my theory, have formerly existed. I have"
1228,"found it difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing"
1228,"to myself, forms DIRECTLY intermediate between them. But this is a"
1228,wholly false view; we should always look for forms intermediate between
1228,each species and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor
1228,will generally have differed in some respects from all its modified
1228,descendants. To give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter
1228,pigeons have both descended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all
1228,"the intermediate varieties which have ever existed, we should have an"
1228,extremely close series between both and the rock-pigeon; but we should
1228,have no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter;
1228,"none, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop"
1228,"somewhat enlarged, the characteristic features of these two breeds."
1228,"These two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that if we had"
1228,"no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin, it would not"
1228,have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of their
1228,"structure with that of the rock-pigeon, whether they had descended from"
1228,"this species or from some other allied species, such as C. oenas."
1228,
1228,"So with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance"
1228,"to the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links ever"
1228,"existed directly intermediate between them, but between each and an"
1228,unknown common parent. The common parent will have had in its whole
1228,organisation much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse; but
1228,"in some points of structure may have differed considerably from both,"
1228,even perhaps more than they differ from each other. Hence in all such
1228,"cases, we should be unable to recognise the parent-form of any two or"
1228,"more species, even if we closely compared the structure of the parent"
1228,"with that of its modified descendants, unless at the same time we had a"
1228,nearly perfect chain of the intermediate links.
1228,
1228,"It is just possible by my theory, that one of two living forms might"
1228,"have descended from the other; for instance, a horse from a tapir; and"
1228,in this case DIRECT intermediate links will have existed between them.
1228,But such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long
1228,"period unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of"
1228,"change; and the principle of competition between organism and organism,"
1228,"between child and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all"
1228,cases the new and improved forms of life will tend to supplant the old
1228,and unimproved forms.
1228,
1228,By the theory of natural selection all living species have been
1228,"connected with the parent-species of each genus, by differences not"
1228,greater than we see between the varieties of the same species at the
1228,"present day; and these parent-species, now generally extinct, have in"
1228,their turn been similarly connected with more ancient species; and so on
1228,"backwards, always converging to the common ancestor of each great class."
1228,"So that the number of intermediate and transitional links, between all"
1228,"living and extinct species, must have been inconceivably great. But"
1228,"assuredly, if this theory be true, such have lived upon this earth."
1228,
1228,ON THE LAPSE OF TIME.
1228,
1228,Independently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitely
1228,"numerous connecting links, it may be objected, that time will not have"
1228,"sufficed for so great an amount of organic change, all changes having"
1228,been effected very slowly through natural selection. It is hardly
1228,"possible for me even to recall to the reader, who may not be a practical"
1228,"geologist, the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the lapse of"
1228,time. He who can read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles
1228,"of Geology, which the future historian will recognise as having produced"
1228,"a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly"
1228,"vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume."
1228,"Not that it suffices to study the Principles of Geology, or to read"
1228,"special treatises by different observers on separate formations, and to"
1228,mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the duration
1228,of each formation or even each stratum. A man must for years examine for
1228,"himself great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the sea at work"
1228,"grinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment, before he can hope to"
1228,"comprehend anything of the lapse of time, the monuments of which we see"
1228,around us.
1228,
1228,"It is good to wander along lines of sea-coast, when formed of moderately"
1228,"hard rocks, and mark the process of degradation. The tides in most cases"
1228,"reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the waves eat"
1228,into them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles; for there
1228,is reason to believe that pure water can effect little or nothing in
1228,"wearing away rock. At last the base of the cliff is undermined, huge"
1228,"fragments fall down, and these remaining fixed, have to be worn away,"
1228,"atom by atom, until reduced in size they can be rolled about by the"
1228,"waves, and then are more quickly ground into pebbles, sand, or mud."
1228,But how often do we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded
1228,"boulders, all thickly clothed by marine productions, showing how little"
1228,"they are abraded and how seldom they are rolled about! Moreover, if"
1228,"we follow for a few miles any line of rocky cliff, which is undergoing"
1228,"degradation, we find that it is only here and there, along a short"
1228,"length or round a promontory, that the cliffs are at the present time"
1228,suffering. The appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that
1228,elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed their base.
1228,
1228,"He who most closely studies the action of the sea on our shores, will,"
1228,"I believe, be most deeply impressed with the slowness with which rocky"
1228,"coasts are worn away. The observations on this head by Hugh Miller,"
1228,"and by that excellent observer Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill, are most"
1228,"impressive. With the mind thus impressed, let any one examine beds of"
1228,"conglomerate many thousand feet in thickness, which, though probably"
1228,"formed at a quicker rate than many other deposits, yet, from being"
1228,"formed of worn and rounded pebbles, each of which bears the stamp of"
1228,"time, are good to show how slowly the mass has been accumulated. Let"
1228,"him remember Lyell's profound remark, that the thickness and extent of"
1228,sedimentary formations are the result and measure of the degradation
1228,which the earth's crust has elsewhere suffered. And what an amount of
1228,degradation is implied by the sedimentary deposits of many countries!
1228,"Professor Ramsay has given me the maximum thickness, in most cases from"
1228,"actual measurement, in a few cases from estimate, of each formation in"
1228,different parts of Great Britain; and this is the result:--
1228,
1228,                                                      Feet
1228,
1228,"     Palaeozoic strata (not including igneous beds)..,."
1228,"     Secondary strata................................,."
1228,"     Tertiary strata..................................,."
1228,
1228,"--making altogether , feet; that is, very nearly thirteen and"
1228,"three-quarters British miles. Some of these formations, which are"
1228,"represented in England by thin beds, are thousands of feet in thickness"
1228,"on the Continent. Moreover, between each successive formation, we have,"
1228,"in the opinion of most geologists, enormously long blank periods."
1228,"So that the lofty pile of sedimentary rocks in Britain, gives but an"
1228,inadequate idea of the time which has elapsed during their accumulation;
1228,yet what time this must have consumed! Good observers have estimated
1228,that sediment is deposited by the great Mississippi river at the rate
1228,of only  feet in a hundred thousand years. This estimate may be quite
1228,"erroneous; yet, considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment is"
1228,"transported by the currents of the sea, the process of accumulation in"
1228,any one area must be extremely slow.
1228,
1228,But the amount of denudation which the strata have in many places
1228,"suffered, independently of the rate of accumulation of the degraded"
1228,"matter, probably offers the best evidence of the lapse of time. I"
1228,"remember having been much struck with the evidence of denudation, when"
1228,"viewing volcanic islands, which have been worn by the waves and pared"
1228,all round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in
1228,"height; for the gentle slope of the lava-streams, due to their formerly"
1228,"liquid state, showed at a glance how far the hard, rocky beds had once"
1228,extended into the open ocean. The same story is still more plainly told
1228,"by faults,--those great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved"
1228,"on one side, or thrown down on the other, to the height or depth of"
1228,"thousands of feet; for since the crust cracked, the surface of the land"
1228,"has been so completely planed down by the action of the sea, that no"
1228,trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible.
1228,
1228,"The Craven fault, for instance, extends for upwards of  miles, and"
1228,along this line the vertical displacement of the strata has varied
1228,from  to  feet. Professor Ramsay has published an account of
1228,a downthrow in Anglesea of  feet; and he informs me that he fully
1228,"believes there is one in Merionethshire of , feet; yet in these"
1228,cases there is nothing on the surface to show such prodigious movements;
1228,the pile of rocks on the one or other side having been smoothly swept
1228,away. The consideration of these facts impresses my mind almost in
1228,the same manner as does the vain endeavour to grapple with the idea of
1228,eternity.
1228,
1228,"I am tempted to give one other case, the well-known one of the"
1228,denudation of the Weald. Though it must be admitted that the denudation
1228,"of the Weald has been a mere trifle, in comparison with that which has"
1228,"removed masses of our palaeozoic strata, in parts ten thousand feet"
1228,"in thickness, as shown in Professor Ramsay's masterly memoir on this"
1228,subject. Yet it is an admirable lesson to stand on the North Downs and
1228,"to look at the distant South Downs; for, remembering that at no great"
1228,distance to the west the northern and southern escarpments meet and
1228,"close, one can safely picture to oneself the great dome of rocks which"
1228,must have covered up the Weald within so limited a period as since the
1228,latter part of the Chalk formation. The distance from the northern to
1228,"the southern Downs is about  miles, and the thickness of the several"
1228,"formations is on an average about  feet, as I am informed by"
1228,"Professor Ramsay. But if, as some geologists suppose, a range of"
1228,"older rocks underlies the Weald, on the flanks of which the overlying"
1228,sedimentary deposits might have accumulated in thinner masses than
1228,"elsewhere, the above estimate would be erroneous; but this source of"
1228,doubt probably would not greatly affect the estimate as applied to the
1228,"western extremity of the district. If, then, we knew the rate at which"
1228,"the sea commonly wears away a line of cliff of any given height, we"
1228,"could measure the time requisite to have denuded the Weald. This, of"
1228,"course, cannot be done; but we may, in order to form some crude notion"
1228,"on the subject, assume that the sea would eat into cliffs  feet in"
1228,height at the rate of one inch in a century. This will at first appear
1228,much too small an allowance; but it is the same as if we were to assume
1228,a cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a whole line of
1228,coast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twenty-two years. I
1228,"doubt whether any rock, even as soft as chalk, would yield at this rate"
1228,excepting on the most exposed coasts; though no doubt the degradation
1228,of a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallen
1228,"fragments. On the other hand, I do not believe that any line of coast,"
1228,"ten or twenty miles in length, ever suffers degradation at the same time"
1228,along its whole indented length; and we must remember that almost all
1228,"strata contain harder layers or nodules, which from long resisting"
1228,"attrition form a breakwater at the base. Hence, under ordinary"
1228,"circumstances, I conclude that for a cliff  feet in height, a"
1228,denudation of one inch per century for the whole length would be an
1228,"ample allowance. At this rate, on the above data, the denudation of the"
1228,"Weald must have required ,, years; or say three hundred million"
1228,years.
1228,
1228,"The action of fresh water on the gently inclined Wealden district, when"
1228,"upraised, could hardly have been great, but it would somewhat reduce the"
1228,"above estimate. On the other hand, during oscillations of level, which"
1228,"we know this area has undergone, the surface may have existed for"
1228,"millions of years as land, and thus have escaped the action of the"
1228,"sea: when deeply submerged for perhaps equally long periods, it would,"
1228,"likewise, have escaped the action of the coast-waves. So that in all"
1228,probability a far longer period than  million years has elapsed since
1228,the latter part of the Secondary period.
1228,
1228,I have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us to
1228,"gain some notion, however imperfect, of the lapse of years. During each"
1228,"of these years, over the whole world, the land and the water has"
1228,been peopled by hosts of living forms. What an infinite number of
1228,"generations, which the mind cannot grasp, must have succeeded each other"
1228,"in the long roll of years! Now turn to our richest geological museums,"
1228,and what a paltry display we behold!
1228,
1228,ON THE POORNESS OF OUR PALAEONTOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS.
1228,
1228,"That our palaeontological collections are very imperfect, is admitted by"
1228,"every one. The remark of that admirable palaeontologist, the late Edward"
1228,"Forbes, should not be forgotten, namely, that numbers of our fossil"
1228,"species are known and named from single and often broken specimens, or"
1228,from a few specimens collected on some one spot. Only a small portion
1228,"of the surface of the earth has been geologically explored, and no part"
1228,"with sufficient care, as the important discoveries made every year in"
1228,Europe prove. No organism wholly soft can be preserved. Shells and
1228,"bones will decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where"
1228,sediment is not accumulating. I believe we are continually taking a
1228,"most erroneous view, when we tacitly admit to ourselves that sediment"
1228,"is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea, at a rate"
1228,sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains. Throughout an
1228,"enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue tint of the"
1228,water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on record of a formation
1228,"conformably covered, after an enormous interval of time, by another"
1228,"and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered in the"
1228,"interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view of the"
1228,bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition.
1228,"The remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel, will when"
1228,the beds are upraised generally be dissolved by the percolation of
1228,rain-water. I suspect that but few of the very many animals which live
1228,"on the beach between high and low watermark are preserved. For instance,"
1228,the several species of the Chthamalinae (a sub-family of sessile
1228,cirripedes) coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers: they
1228,"are all strictly littoral, with the exception of a single Mediterranean"
1228,"species, which inhabits deep water and has been found fossil in Sicily,"
1228,whereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary
1228,formation: yet it is now known that the genus Chthamalus existed
1228,during the chalk period. The molluscan genus Chiton offers a partially
1228,analogous case.
1228,
1228,With respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the
1228,"Secondary and Palaeozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that our"
1228,evidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree. For
1228,"instance, not a land shell is known belonging to either of these"
1228,"vast periods, with one exception discovered by Sir C. Lyell in the"
1228,"carboniferous strata of North America. In regard to mammiferous remains,"
1228,a single glance at the historical table published in the Supplement to
1228,"Lyell's Manual, will bring home the truth, how accidental and rare is"
1228,"their preservation, far better than pages of detail. Nor is their rarity"
1228,"surprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of"
1228,tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine
1228,deposits; and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging
1228,to the age of our secondary or palaeozoic formations.
1228,
1228,But the imperfection in the geological record mainly results from
1228,"another and more important cause than any of the foregoing; namely, from"
1228,the several formations being separated from each other by wide intervals
1228,"of time. When we see the formations tabulated in written works, or when"
1228,"we follow them in nature, it is difficult to avoid believing that"
1228,"they are closely consecutive. But we know, for instance, from Sir R."
1228,"Murchison's great work on Russia, what wide gaps there are in that"
1228,"country between the superimposed formations; so it is in North America,"
1228,"and in many other parts of the world. The most skilful geologist, if"
1228,"his attention had been exclusively confined to these large territories,"
1228,would never have suspected that during the periods which were blank and
1228,"barren in his own country, great piles of sediment, charged with new and"
1228,"peculiar forms of life, had elsewhere been accumulated. And if in each"
1228,"separate territory, hardly any idea can be formed of the length of time"
1228,"which has elapsed between the consecutive formations, we may infer that"
1228,this could nowhere be ascertained. The frequent and great changes in the
1228,"mineralogical composition of consecutive formations, generally implying"
1228,"great changes in the geography of the surrounding lands, whence the"
1228,"sediment has been derived, accords with the belief of vast intervals of"
1228,time having elapsed between each formation.
1228,
1228,"But we can, I think, see why the geological formations of each region"
1228,"are almost invariably intermittent; that is, have not followed each"
1228,other in close sequence. Scarcely any fact struck me more when examining
1228,"many hundred miles of the South American coasts, which have been"
1228,"upraised several hundred feet within the recent period, than the absence"
1228,of any recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short
1228,"geological period. Along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by a"
1228,"peculiar marine fauna, tertiary beds are so scantily developed, that no"
1228,record of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be
1228,preserved to a distant age. A little reflection will explain why along
1228,"the rising coast of the western side of South America, no extensive"
1228,"formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found, though"
1228,"the supply of sediment must for ages have been great, from the enormous"
1228,degradation of the coast-rocks and from muddy streams entering the
1228,"sea. The explanation, no doubt, is, that the littoral and sub-littoral"
1228,"deposits are continually worn away, as soon as they are brought up by"
1228,the slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action of
1228,the coast-waves.
1228,
1228,"We may, I think, safely conclude that sediment must be accumulated in"
1228,"extremely thick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand the"
1228,"incessant action of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent"
1228,oscillations of level. Such thick and extensive accumulations of
1228,"sediment may be formed in two ways; either, in profound depths of the"
1228,"sea, in which case, judging from the researches of E. Forbes, we may"
1228,"conclude that the bottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals, and"
1228,the mass when upraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms
1228,"of life which then existed; or, sediment may be accumulated to any"
1228,"thickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to"
1228,"subside. In this latter case, as long as the rate of subsidence and"
1228,"supply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain"
1228,"shallow and favourable for life, and thus a fossiliferous formation"
1228,"thick enough, when upraised, to resist any amount of degradation, may be"
1228,formed.
1228,
1228,"I am convinced that all our ancient formations, which are rich in"
1228,"fossils, have thus been formed during subsidence. Since publishing my"
1228,"views on this subject in , I have watched the progress of Geology,"
1228,"and have been surprised to note how author after author, in treating"
1228,"of this or that great formation, has come to the conclusion that it was"
1228,"accumulated during subsidence. I may add, that the only ancient tertiary"
1228,"formation on the west coast of South America, which has been bulky"
1228,"enough to resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered, but which"
1228,"will hardly last to a distant geological age, was certainly deposited"
1228,"during a downward oscillation of level, and thus gained considerable"
1228,thickness.
1228,
1228,All geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone
1228,"numerous slow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations"
1228,have affected wide spaces. Consequently formations rich in fossils and
1228,"sufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation, may"
1228,"have been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only"
1228,where the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and
1228,to embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay. On the
1228,"other hand, as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary, THICK"
1228,"deposits could not have been accumulated in the shallow parts, which are"
1228,the most favourable to life. Still less could this have happened during
1228,"the alternate periods of elevation; or, to speak more accurately, the"
1228,beds which were then accumulated will have been destroyed by being
1228,upraised and brought within the limits of the coast-action.
1228,
1228,Thus the geological record will almost necessarily be rendered
1228,"intermittent. I feel much confidence in the truth of these views, for"
1228,they are in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated
1228,by Sir C. Lyell; and E. Forbes independently arrived at a similar
1228,conclusion.
1228,
1228,One remark is here worth a passing notice. During periods of elevation
1228,the area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will
1228,"be increased, and new stations will often be formed;--all circumstances"
1228,"most favourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new"
1228,varieties and species; but during such periods there will generally be
1228,"a blank in the geological record. On the other hand, during subsidence,"
1228,the inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease (excepting
1228,the productions on the shores of a continent when first broken up into
1228,"an archipelago), and consequently during subsidence, though there will"
1228,"be much extinction, fewer new varieties or species will be formed; and"
1228,"it is during these very periods of subsidence, that our great deposits"
1228,rich in fossils have been accumulated. Nature may almost be said to have
1228,guarded against the frequent discovery of her transitional or linking
1228,forms.
1228,
1228,From the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that the
1228,"geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if we"
1228,"confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes more difficult"
1228,"to understand, why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties"
1228,between the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its
1228,close. Some cases are on record of the same species presenting distinct
1228,"varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation, but, as"
1228,"they are rare, they may be here passed over. Although each formation has"
1228,"indisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition, I can"
1228,see several reasons why each should not include a graduated series
1228,of links between the species which then lived; but I can by no
1228,means pretend to assign due proportional weight to the following
1228,considerations.
1228,
1228,"Although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each"
1228,perhaps is short compared with the period requisite to change one
1228,"species into another. I am aware that two palaeontologists, whose"
1228,"opinions are worthy of much deference, namely Bronn and Woodward, have"
1228,concluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice
1228,as long as the average duration of specific forms. But insuperable
1228,"difficulties, as it seems to me, prevent us coming to any just"
1228,conclusion on this head. When we see a species first appearing in the
1228,"middle of any formation, it would be rash in the extreme to infer that"
1228,it had not elsewhere previously existed. So again when we find a species
1228,"disappearing before the uppermost layers have been deposited, it would"
1228,be equally rash to suppose that it then became wholly extinct. We forget
1228,how small the area of Europe is compared with the rest of the world;
1228,nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout Europe been
1228,correlated with perfect accuracy.
1228,
1228,"With marine animals of all kinds, we may safely infer a large amount of"
1228,migration during climatal and other changes; and when we see a species
1228,"first appearing in any formation, the probability is that it only then"
1228,"first immigrated into that area. It is well known, for instance, that"
1228,several species appeared somewhat earlier in the palaeozoic beds of
1228,North America than in those of Europe; time having apparently been
1228,required for their migration from the American to the European seas. In
1228,"examining the latest deposits of various quarters of the world, it has"
1228,"everywhere been noted, that some few still existing species are common"
1228,"in the deposit, but have become extinct in the immediately surrounding"
1228,"sea; or, conversely, that some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea,"
1228,but are rare or absent in this particular deposit. It is an excellent
1228,lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount of migration of the
1228,"inhabitants of Europe during the Glacial period, which forms only a part"
1228,of one whole geological period; and likewise to reflect on the great
1228,"changes of level, on the inordinately great change of climate, on the"
1228,"prodigious lapse of time, all included within this same glacial period."
1228,"Yet it may be doubted whether in any quarter of the world, sedimentary"
1228,"deposits, INCLUDING FOSSIL REMAINS, have gone on accumulating within"
1228,"the same area during the whole of this period. It is not, for instance,"
1228,probable that sediment was deposited during the whole of the glacial
1228,"period near the mouth of the Mississippi, within that limit of depth at"
1228,which marine animals can flourish; for we know what vast geographical
1228,changes occurred in other parts of America during this space of time.
1228,When such beds as were deposited in shallow water near the mouth of
1228,the Mississippi during some part of the glacial period shall have been
1228,"upraised, organic remains will probably first appear and disappear at"
1228,"different levels, owing to the migration of species and to geographical"
1228,"changes. And in the distant future, a geologist examining these beds,"
1228,might be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life of the
1228,"embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period, instead"
1228,"of having been really far greater, that is extending from before the"
1228,glacial epoch to the present day.
1228,
1228,In order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper
1228,"and lower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on"
1228,"accumulating for a very long period, in order to have given sufficient"
1228,time for the slow process of variation; hence the deposit will generally
1228,have to be a very thick one; and the species undergoing modification
1228,will have had to live on the same area throughout this whole time.
1228,But we have seen that a thick fossiliferous formation can only be
1228,accumulated during a period of subsidence; and to keep the depth
1228,"approximately the same, which is necessary in order to enable the same"
1228,"species to live on the same space, the supply of sediment must nearly"
1228,have counterbalanced the amount of subsidence. But this same movement
1228,of subsidence will often tend to sink the area whence the sediment
1228,"is derived, and thus diminish the supply whilst the downward movement"
1228,"continues. In fact, this nearly exact balancing between the supply of"
1228,sediment and the amount of subsidence is probably a rare contingency;
1228,"for it has been observed by more than one palaeontologist, that very"
1228,"thick deposits are usually barren of organic remains, except near their"
1228,upper or lower limits.
1228,
1228,"It would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of"
1228,"formations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its"
1228,"accumulation. When we see, as is so often the case, a formation composed"
1228,"of beds of different mineralogical composition, we may reasonably"
1228,"suspect that the process of deposition has been much interrupted, as"
1228,a change in the currents of the sea and a supply of sediment of a
1228,different nature will generally have been due to geographical changes
1228,requiring much time. Nor will the closest inspection of a formation give
1228,any idea of the time which its deposition has consumed. Many instances
1228,"could be given of beds only a few feet in thickness, representing"
1228,"formations, elsewhere thousands of feet in thickness, and which must"
1228,have required an enormous period for their accumulation; yet no one
1228,ignorant of this fact would have suspected the vast lapse of time
1228,represented by the thinner formation. Many cases could be given of the
1228,"lower beds of a formation having been upraised, denuded, submerged, and"
1228,"then re-covered by the upper beds of the same formation,--facts,"
1228,"showing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals have occurred in"
1228,its accumulation. In other cases we have the plainest evidence in great
1228,"fossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew, of many long"
1228,"intervals of time and changes of level during the process of deposition,"
1228,"which would never even have been suspected, had not the trees chanced to"
1228,"have been preserved: thus, Messrs. Lyell and Dawson found carboniferous"
1228,"beds  feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient root-bearing strata,"
1228,"one above the other, at no less than sixty-eight different levels."
1228,"Hence, when the same species occur at the bottom, middle, and top of a"
1228,"formation, the probability is that they have not lived on the same"
1228,"spot during the whole period of deposition, but have disappeared and"
1228,"reappeared, perhaps many times, during the same geological period."
1228,So that if such species were to undergo a considerable amount of
1228,"modification during any one geological period, a section would not"
1228,probably include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on
1228,"my theory have existed between them, but abrupt, though perhaps very"
1228,"slight, changes of form."
1228,
1228,It is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule
1228,by which to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little
1228,"variability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater"
1228,"amount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species,"
1228,unless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediate
1228,gradations. And this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hope
1228,to effect in any one geological section. Supposing B and C to be two
1228,"species, and a third, A, to be found in an underlying bed; even if A"
1228,"were strictly intermediate between B and C, it would simply be ranked as"
1228,"a third and distinct species, unless at the same time it could be"
1228,most closely connected with either one or both forms by intermediate
1228,"varieties. Nor should it be forgotten, as before explained, that A"
1228,"might be the actual progenitor of B and C, and yet might not at all"
1228,necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all points of
1228,structure. So that we might obtain the parent-species and its several
1228,"modified descendants from the lower and upper beds of a formation,"
1228,"and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we should not"
1228,"recognise their relationship, and should consequently be compelled to"
1228,rank them all as distinct species.
1228,
1228,It is notorious on what excessively slight differences many
1228,palaeontologists have founded their species; and they do this the more
1228,readily if the specimens come from different sub-stages of the same
1228,formation. Some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the
1228,very fine species of D'Orbigny and others into the rank of varieties;
1228,and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on my
1228,"theory we ought to find. Moreover, if we look to rather wider intervals,"
1228,"namely, to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great formation,"
1228,"we find that the embedded fossils, though almost universally ranked as"
1228,"specifically different, yet are far more closely allied to each other"
1228,than are the species found in more widely separated formations; but to
1228,this subject I shall have to return in the following chapter.
1228,
1228,One other consideration is worth notice: with animals and plants that
1228,"can propagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive, there is reason to"
1228,"suspect, as we have formerly seen, that their varieties are generally"
1228,at first local; and that such local varieties do not spread widely and
1228,supplant their parent-forms until they have been modified and perfected
1228,"in some considerable degree. According to this view, the chance of"
1228,discovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages of
1228,"transition between any two forms, is small, for the successive changes"
1228,are supposed to have been local or confined to some one spot. Most
1228,marine animals have a wide range; and we have seen that with plants it
1228,"is those which have the widest range, that oftenest present varieties;"
1228,"so that with shells and other marine animals, it is probably those"
1228,"which have had the widest range, far exceeding the limits of the known"
1228,"geological formations of Europe, which have oftenest given rise, first"
1228,to local varieties and ultimately to new species; and this again would
1228,greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of
1228,transition in any one geological formation.
1228,
1228,"It should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with perfect"
1228,"specimens for examination, two forms can seldom be connected by"
1228,"intermediate varieties and thus proved to be the same species, until"
1228,many specimens have been collected from many places; and in the case
1228,of fossil species this could rarely be effected by palaeontologists. We
1228,"shall, perhaps, best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to"
1228,"connect species by numerous, fine, intermediate, fossil links, by asking"
1228,"ourselves whether, for instance, geologists at some future period will"
1228,"be able to prove, that our different breeds of cattle, sheep, horses,"
1228,and dogs have descended from a single stock or from several aboriginal
1228,"stocks; or, again, whether certain sea-shells inhabiting the shores"
1228,"of North America, which are ranked by some conchologists as distinct"
1228,"species from their European representatives, and by other conchologists"
1228,"as only varieties, are really varieties or are, as it is called,"
1228,specifically distinct. This could be effected only by the future
1228,geologist discovering in a fossil state numerous intermediate
1228,gradations; and such success seems to me improbable in the highest
1228,degree.
1228,
1228,"Geological research, though it has added numerous species to existing"
1228,"and extinct genera, and has made the intervals between some few groups"
1228,"less wide than they otherwise would have been, yet has done scarcely"
1228,"anything in breaking down the distinction between species, by connecting"
1228,"them together by numerous, fine, intermediate varieties; and this not"
1228,"having been effected, is probably the gravest and most obvious of all"
1228,the many objections which may be urged against my views. Hence it will
1228,"be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks, under an imaginary"
1228,illustration. The Malay Archipelago is of about the size of Europe from
1228,"the North Cape to the Mediterranean, and from Britain to Russia; and"
1228,therefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined
1228,"with any accuracy, excepting those of the United States of America. I"
1228,"fully agree with Mr. Godwin-Austen, that the present condition of the"
1228,"Malay Archipelago, with its numerous large islands separated by wide and"
1228,"shallow seas, probably represents the former state of Europe, when most"
1228,of our formations were accumulating. The Malay Archipelago is one of
1228,the richest regions of the whole world in organic beings; yet if all
1228,"the species were to be collected which have ever lived there, how"
1228,imperfectly would they represent the natural history of the world!
1228,
1228,But we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of
1228,the archipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner in
1228,the formations which we suppose to be there accumulating. I suspect that
1228,"not many of the strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on"
1228,"naked submarine rocks, would be embedded; and those embedded in gravel"
1228,"or sand, would not endure to a distant epoch. Wherever sediment did not"
1228,"accumulate on the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a"
1228,"sufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could"
1228,be preserved.
1228,
1228,"In our archipelago, I believe that fossiliferous formations could be"
1228,"formed of sufficient thickness to last to an age, as distant in futurity"
1228,"as the secondary formations lie in the past, only during periods of"
1228,subsidence. These periods of subsidence would be separated from each
1228,"other by enormous intervals, during which the area would be either"
1228,"stationary or rising; whilst rising, each fossiliferous formation"
1228,"would be destroyed, almost as soon as accumulated, by the incessant"
1228,"coast-action, as we now see on the shores of South America. During the"
1228,periods of subsidence there would probably be much extinction of life;
1228,"during the periods of elevation, there would be much variation, but the"
1228,geological record would then be least perfect.
1228,
1228,It may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of
1228,"subsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with"
1228,"a contemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would EXCEED the average"
1228,duration of the same specific forms; and these contingencies are
1228,indispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations
1228,between any two or more species. If such gradations were not fully
1228,"preserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many"
1228,"distinct species. It is, also, probable that each great period of"
1228,"subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level, and that"
1228,slight climatal changes would intervene during such lengthy periods; and
1228,"in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate,"
1228,and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could be
1228,preserved in any one formation.
1228,
1228,Very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range
1228,thousands of miles beyond its confines; and analogy leads me to believe
1228,that it would be chiefly these far-ranging species which would oftenest
1228,produce new varieties; and the varieties would at first generally
1228,"be local or confined to one place, but if possessed of any decided"
1228,"advantage, or when further modified and improved, they would slowly"
1228,spread and supplant their parent-forms. When such varieties returned to
1228,"their ancient homes, as they would differ from their former state, in"
1228,"a nearly uniform, though perhaps extremely slight degree, they would,"
1228,"according to the principles followed by many palaeontologists, be ranked"
1228,as new and distinct species.
1228,
1228,"If then, there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no"
1228,"right to expect to find in our geological formations, an infinite number"
1228,"of those fine transitional forms, which on my theory assuredly have"
1228,connected all the past and present species of the same group into one
1228,"long and branching chain of life. We ought only to look for a few links,"
1228,"some more closely, some more distantly related to each other; and these"
1228,"links, let them be ever so close, if found in different stages of the"
1228,"same formation, would, by most palaeontologists, be ranked as distinct"
1228,species. But I do not pretend that I should ever have suspected how poor
1228,"a record of the mutations of life, the best preserved geological section"
1228,"presented, had not the difficulty of our not discovering innumerable"
1228,transitional links between the species which appeared at the
1228,"commencement and close of each formation, pressed so hardly on my"
1228,theory.
1228,
1228,ON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF WHOLE GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES.
1228,
1228,The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in
1228,"certain formations, has been urged by several palaeontologists,"
1228,"for instance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and by none more forcibly than"
1228,"by Professor Sedgwick, as a fatal objection to the belief in the"
1228,"transmutation of species. If numerous species, belonging to the same"
1228,"genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact"
1228,would be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through
1228,"natural selection. For the development of a group of forms, all of which"
1228,"have descended from some one progenitor, must have been an extremely"
1228,slow process; and the progenitors must have lived long ages before their
1228,modified descendants. But we continually over-rate the perfection of the
1228,"geological record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or families"
1228,"have not been found beneath a certain stage, that they did not exist"
1228,"before that stage. We continually forget how large the world is,"
1228,compared with the area over which our geological formations have been
1228,carefully examined; we forget that groups of species may elsewhere have
1228,long existed and have slowly multiplied before they invaded the ancient
1228,archipelagoes of Europe and of the United States. We do not make due
1228,"allowance for the enormous intervals of time, which have probably"
1228,"elapsed between our consecutive formations,--longer perhaps in some"
1228,cases than the time required for the accumulation of each formation.
1228,These intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species
1228,from some one or some few parent-forms; and in the succeeding formation
1228,such species will appear as if suddenly created.
1228,
1228,"I may here recall a remark formerly made, namely that it might require"
1228,a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar
1228,"line of life, for instance to fly through the air; but that when this"
1228,"had been effected, and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage"
1228,"over other organisms, a comparatively short time would be necessary to"
1228,"produce many divergent forms, which would be able to spread rapidly and"
1228,widely throughout the world.
1228,
1228,I will now give a few examples to illustrate these remarks; and to show
1228,how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species
1228,have suddenly been produced. I may recall the well-known fact that in
1228,"geological treatises, published not many years ago, the great class"
1228,of mammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the
1228,commencement of the tertiary series. And now one of the richest known
1228,accumulations of fossil mammals belongs to the middle of the secondary
1228,series; and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone
1228,at nearly the commencement of this great series. Cuvier used to urge
1228,that no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum; but now extinct species
1228,"have been discovered in India, South America, and in Europe even as far"
1228,"back as the eocene stage. The most striking case, however, is that of"
1228,"the Whale family; as these animals have huge bones, are marine, and"
1228,"range over the world, the fact of not a single bone of a whale having"
1228,"been discovered in any secondary formation, seemed fully to justify the"
1228,belief that this great and distinct order had been suddenly produced
1228,in the interval between the latest secondary and earliest tertiary
1228,"formation. But now we may read in the Supplement to Lyell's 'Manual,'"
1228,"published in , clear evidence of the existence of whales in the"
1228,"upper greensand, some time before the close of the secondary period."
1228,
1228,"I may give another instance, which from having passed under my own eyes"
1228,"has much struck me. In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes, I have"
1228,"stated that, from the number of existing and extinct tertiary species;"
1228,from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species
1228,"all over the world, from the Arctic regions to the equator, inhabiting"
1228,various zones of depths from the upper tidal limits to  fathoms;
1228,from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest
1228,tertiary beds; from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve can
1228,"be recognised; from all these circumstances, I inferred that had sessile"
1228,"cirripedes existed during the secondary periods, they would certainly"
1228,have been preserved and discovered; and as not one species had been
1228,"discovered in beds of this age, I concluded that this great group had"
1228,been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary series. This
1228,"was a sore trouble to me, adding as I thought one more instance of the"
1228,abrupt appearance of a great group of species. But my work had hardly
1228,"been published, when a skilful palaeontologist, M. Bosquet, sent me a"
1228,"drawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakeable sessile cirripede,"
1228,"which he had himself extracted from the chalk of Belgium. And, as if"
1228,"to make the case as striking as possible, this sessile cirripede was a"
1228,"Chthamalus, a very common, large, and ubiquitous genus, of which not one"
1228,specimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum. Hence we
1228,now positively know that sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary
1228,period; and these cirripedes might have been the progenitors of our many
1228,tertiary and existing species.
1228,
1228,The case most frequently insisted on by palaeontologists of the
1228,"apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the"
1228,"teleostean fishes, low down in the Chalk period. This group includes the"
1228,"large majority of existing species. Lately, Professor Pictet has carried"
1228,their existence one sub-stage further back; and some palaeontologists
1228,"believe that certain much older fishes, of which the affinities are as"
1228,"yet imperfectly known, are really teleostean. Assuming, however, that"
1228,"the whole of them did appear, as Agassiz believes, at the commencement"
1228,"of the chalk formation, the fact would certainly be highly remarkable;"
1228,but I cannot see that it would be an insuperable difficulty on my
1228,"theory, unless it could likewise be shown that the species of this group"
1228,appeared suddenly and simultaneously throughout the world at this same
1228,period. It is almost superfluous to remark that hardly any fossil-fish
1228,are known from south of the equator; and by running through Pictet's
1228,Palaeontology it will be seen that very few species are known from
1228,several formations in Europe. Some few families of fish now have a
1228,confined range; the teleostean fish might formerly have had a similarly
1228,"confined range, and after having been largely developed in some one sea,"
1228,might have spread widely. Nor have we any right to suppose that the seas
1228,of the world have always been so freely open from south to north as
1228,"they are at present. Even at this day, if the Malay Archipelago were"
1228,"converted into land, the tropical parts of the Indian Ocean would form"
1228,"a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any great group of marine"
1228,"animals might be multiplied; and here they would remain confined, until"
1228,"some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate, and were enabled"
1228,"to double the southern capes of Africa or Australia, and thus reach"
1228,other and distant seas.
1228,
1228,"From these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance"
1228,of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the
1228,United States; and from the revolution in our palaeontological ideas
1228,"on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have"
1228,"effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the"
1228,"succession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for"
1228,a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in
1228,"Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions."
1228,
1228,ON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES IN THE LOWEST KNOWN
1228,FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA.
1228,
1228,"There is another and allied difficulty, which is much graver. I allude"
1228,"to the manner in which numbers of species of the same group, suddenly"
1228,appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks. Most of the arguments
1228,which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same group
1228,"have descended from one progenitor, apply with nearly equal force to"
1228,"the earliest known species. For instance, I cannot doubt that all the"
1228,"Silurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean, which must"
1228,"have lived long before the Silurian age, and which probably differed"
1228,greatly from any known animal. Some of the most ancient Silurian
1228,"animals, as the Nautilus, Lingula, etc., do not differ much from living"
1228,"species; and it cannot on my theory be supposed, that these old species"
1228,were the progenitors of all the species of the orders to which they
1228,"belong, for they do not present characters in any degree intermediate"
1228,"between them. If, moreover, they had been the progenitors of these"
1228,"orders, they would almost certainly have been long ago supplanted and"
1228,exterminated by their numerous and improved descendants.
1228,
1228,"Consequently, if my theory be true, it is indisputable that before the"
1228,"lowest Silurian stratum was deposited, long periods elapsed, as long as,"
1228,"or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Silurian age to"
1228,"the present day; and that during these vast, yet quite unknown, periods"
1228,"of time, the world swarmed with living creatures."
1228,
1228,To the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial
1228,"periods, I can give no satisfactory answer. Several of the most eminent"
1228,"geologists, with Sir R. Murchison at their head, are convinced that we"
1228,see in the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum the dawn of
1228,"life on this planet. Other highly competent judges, as Lyell and the"
1228,"late E. Forbes, dispute this conclusion. We should not forget that only"
1228,a small portion of the world is known with accuracy. M. Barrande has
1228,"lately added another and lower stage to the Silurian system, abounding"
1228,with new and peculiar species. Traces of life have been detected in the
1228,Longmynd beds beneath Barrande's so-called primordial zone. The presence
1228,of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic
1228,"rocks, probably indicates the former existence of life at these periods."
1228,But the difficulty of understanding the absence of vast piles of
1228,"fossiliferous strata, which on my theory no doubt were somewhere"
1228,"accumulated before the Silurian epoch, is very great. If these most"
1228,"ancient beds had been wholly worn away by denudation, or obliterated"
1228,"by metamorphic action, we ought to find only small remnants of the"
1228,"formations next succeeding them in age, and these ought to be very"
1228,generally in a metamorphosed condition. But the descriptions which we
1228,now possess of the Silurian deposits over immense territories in
1228,"Russia and in North America, do not support the view, that the older a"
1228,"formation is, the more it has suffered the extremity of denudation and"
1228,metamorphism.
1228,
1228,The case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as
1228,a valid argument against the views here entertained. To show that it
1228,"may hereafter receive some explanation, I will give the following"
1228,"hypothesis. From the nature of the organic remains, which do not appear"
1228,"to have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe"
1228,"and of the United States; and from the amount of sediment, miles in"
1228,"thickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from"
1228,"first to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was"
1228,"derived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the existing continents of"
1228,Europe and North America. But we do not know what was the state of
1228,things in the intervals between the successive formations; whether
1228,Europe and the United States during these intervals existed as dry
1228,"land, or as a submarine surface near land, on which sediment was not"
1228,"deposited, or again as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea."
1228,
1228,"Looking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the"
1228,"land, we see them studded with many islands; but not one oceanic island"
1228,is as yet known to afford even a remnant of any palaeozoic or secondary
1228,"formation. Hence we may perhaps infer, that during the palaeozoic and"
1228,"secondary periods, neither continents nor continental islands existed"
1228,"where our oceans now extend; for had they existed there, palaeozoic and"
1228,secondary formations would in all probability have been accumulated from
1228,sediment derived from their wear and tear; and would have been at least
1228,"partially upheaved by the oscillations of level, which we may fairly"
1228,conclude must have intervened during these enormously long periods. If
1228,"then we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that where"
1228,"our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest period of"
1228,"which we have any record; and on the other hand, that where continents"
1228,"now exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected no doubt to"
1228,"great oscillations of level, since the earliest silurian period. The"
1228,"coloured map appended to my volume on Coral Reefs, led me to conclude"
1228,"that the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence, the great"
1228,"archipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level, and the continents"
1228,areas of elevation. But have we any right to assume that things have
1228,thus remained from eternity? Our continents seem to have been formed
1228,"by a preponderance, during many oscillations of level, of the force of"
1228,elevation; but may not the areas of preponderant movement have changed
1228,in the lapse of ages? At a period immeasurably antecedent to the
1228,"silurian epoch, continents may have existed where oceans are now spread"
1228,out; and clear and open oceans may have existed where our continents now
1228,"stand. Nor should we be justified in assuming that if, for instance, the"
1228,"bed of the Pacific Ocean were now converted into a continent, we should"
1228,"there find formations older than the silurian strata, supposing such to"
1228,have been formerly deposited; for it might well happen that strata which
1228,"had subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth, and which"
1228,"had been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water, might"
1228,have undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always
1228,remained nearer to the surface. The immense areas in some parts of the
1228,"world, for instance in South America, of bare metamorphic rocks, which"
1228,"must have been heated under great pressure, have always seemed to me to"
1228,require some special explanation; and we may perhaps believe that we see
1228,"in these large areas, the many formations long anterior to the silurian"
1228,epoch in a completely metamorphosed condition.
1228,
1228,"The several difficulties here discussed, namely our not finding in the"
1228,successive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the
1228,many species which now exist or have existed; the sudden manner in which
1228,whole groups of species appear in our European formations; the almost
1228,"entire absence, as at present known, of fossiliferous formations beneath"
1228,"the Silurian strata, are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature. We"
1228,see this in the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminent
1228,"palaeontologists, namely Cuvier, Owen, Agassiz, Barrande, Falconer,"
1228,"E. Forbes, etc., and all our greatest geologists, as Lyell, Murchison,"
1228,"Sedgwick, etc., have unanimously, often vehemently, maintained the"
1228,immutability of species. But I have reason to believe that one great
1228,"authority, Sir Charles Lyell, from further reflexion entertains grave"
1228,doubts on this subject. I feel how rash it is to differ from these great
1228,"authorities, to whom, with others, we owe all our knowledge. Those who"
1228,"think the natural geological record in any degree perfect, and who do"
1228,not attach much weight to the facts and arguments of other kinds given
1228,"in this volume, will undoubtedly at once reject my theory. For my part,"
1228,"following out Lyell's metaphor, I look at the natural geological record,"
1228,"as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing"
1228,"dialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating only"
1228,"to two or three countries. Of this volume, only here and there a short"
1228,"chapter has been preserved; and of each page, only here and there a few"
1228,"lines. Each word of the slowly-changing language, in which the"
1228,"history is supposed to be written, being more or less different in"
1228,"the interrupted succession of chapters, may represent the apparently"
1228,"abruptly changed forms of life, entombed in our consecutive, but widely"
1228,"separated formations. On this view, the difficulties above discussed are"
1228,"greatly diminished, or even disappear."

1228,
1228,On the slow and successive appearance of new species. On their different
1228,rates of change. Species once lost do not reappear. Groups of species

1228,forms. On the succession of the same types within the same areas.
1228,Summary of preceding and present chapters.
1228,
1228,Let us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to the
1228,"geological succession of organic beings, better accord with the common"
1228,"view of the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and"
1228,"gradual modification, through descent and natural selection."
1228,
1228,"New species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on the"
1228,land and in the waters. Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to
1228,resist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary
1228,"stages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks between them, and to"
1228,make the percentage system of lost and new forms more gradual. In
1228,"some of the most recent beds, though undoubtedly of high antiquity if"
1228,"measured by years, only one or two species are lost forms, and only one"
1228,"or two are new forms, having here appeared for the first time, either"
1228,"locally, or, as far as we know, on the face of the earth. If we may"
1228,"trust the observations of Philippi in Sicily, the successive changes in"
1228,the marine inhabitants of that island have been many and most gradual.
1228,"The secondary formations are more broken; but, as Bronn has remarked,"
1228,neither the appearance nor disappearance of their many now extinct
1228,species has been simultaneous in each separate formation.
1228,
1228,Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same
1228,"rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living"
1228,shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms.
1228,"Falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, in an existing"
1228,crocodile associated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in
1228,the sub-Himalayan deposits. The Silurian Lingula differs but little from
1228,the living species of this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian
1228,Molluscs and all the Crustaceans have changed greatly. The productions
1228,"of the land seem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of"
1228,which a striking instance has lately been observed in Switzerland. There
1228,"is some reason to believe that organisms, considered high in the scale"
1228,"of nature, change more quickly than those that are low: though there"
1228,"are exceptions to this rule. The amount of organic change, as Pictet"
1228,"has remarked, does not strictly correspond with the succession of our"
1228,"geological formations; so that between each two consecutive formations,"
1228,the forms of life have seldom changed in exactly the same degree. Yet if
1228,"we compare any but the most closely related formations, all the species"
1228,will be found to have undergone some change. When a species has once
1228,"disappeared from the face of the earth, we have reason to believe"
1228,that the same identical form never reappears. The strongest apparent
1228,"exception to this latter rule, is that of the so-called ""colonies"" of M."
1228,"Barrande, which intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation,"
1228,and then allow the pre-existing fauna to reappear; but Lyell's
1228,"explanation, namely, that it is a case of temporary migration from a"
1228,"distinct geographical province, seems to me satisfactory."
1228,
1228,These several facts accord well with my theory. I believe in no fixed
1228,"law of development, causing all the inhabitants of a country to change"
1228,"abruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. The process of"
1228,modification must be extremely slow. The variability of each species
1228,is quite independent of that of all others. Whether such variability be
1228,"taken advantage of by natural selection, and whether the variations be"
1228,"accumulated to a greater or lesser amount, thus causing a greater or"
1228,"lesser amount of modification in the varying species, depends on many"
1228,"complex contingencies,--on the variability being of a beneficial nature,"
1228,"on the power of intercrossing, on the rate of breeding, on the slowly"
1228,"changing physical conditions of the country, and more especially on the"
1228,nature of the other inhabitants with which the varying species comes
1228,into competition. Hence it is by no means surprising that one species
1228,"should retain the same identical form much longer than others; or,"
1228,"if changing, that it should change less. We see the same fact in"
1228,"geographical distribution; for instance, in the land-shells and"
1228,coleopterous insects of Madeira having come to differ considerably from
1228,"their nearest allies on the continent of Europe, whereas the marine"
1228,shells and birds have remained unaltered. We can perhaps understand
1228,the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly
1228,"organised productions compared with marine and lower productions, by"
1228,the more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and
1228,"inorganic conditions of life, as explained in a former chapter. When"
1228,"many of the inhabitants of a country have become modified and improved,"
1228,"we can understand, on the principle of competition, and on that of the"
1228,"many all-important relations of organism to organism, that any form"
1228,"which does not become in some degree modified and improved, will be"
1228,liable to be exterminated. Hence we can see why all the species in the
1228,"same region do at last, if we look to wide enough intervals of time,"
1228,become modified; for those which do not change will become extinct.
1228,
1228,"In members of the same class the average amount of change, during long"
1228,"and equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the"
1228,accumulation of long-enduring fossiliferous formations depends on great
1228,"masses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding,"
1228,our formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and
1228,irregularly intermittent intervals; consequently the amount of organic
1228,change exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations
1228,"is not equal. Each formation, on this view, does not mark a new and"
1228,"complete act of creation, but only an occasional scene, taken almost at"
1228,"hazard, in a slowly changing drama."
1228,
1228,We can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never
1228,"reappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and"
1228,"inorganic, should recur. For though the offspring of one species might"
1228,be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to
1228,"fill the exact place of another species in the economy of nature, and"
1228,thus supplant it; yet the two forms--the old and the new--would not be
1228,identically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different
1228,"characters from their distinct progenitors. For instance, it is just"
1228,"possible, if our fantail-pigeons were all destroyed, that fanciers, by"
1228,"striving during long ages for the same object, might make a new breed"
1228,hardly distinguishable from our present fantail; but if the parent
1228,"rock-pigeon were also destroyed, and in nature we have every reason"
1228,to believe that the parent-form will generally be supplanted and
1228,"exterminated by its improved offspring, it is quite incredible that a"
1228,"fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any"
1228,"other species of pigeon, or even from the other well-established races"
1228,"of the domestic pigeon, for the newly-formed fantail would be almost"
1228,sure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristic
1228,differences.
1228,
1228,"Groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general"
1228,"rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species,"
1228,"changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser degree. A"
1228,"group does not reappear after it has once disappeared; or its existence,"
1228,"as long as it lasts, is continuous. I am aware that there are some"
1228,"apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions are surprisingly"
1228,"few, so few, that E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward (though all strongly"
1228,opposed to such views as I maintain) admit its truth; and the rule
1228,strictly accords with my theory. For as all the species of the same
1228,"group have descended from some one species, it is clear that as long as"
1228,"any species of the group have appeared in the long succession of ages,"
1228,"so long must its members have continuously existed, in order to have"
1228,generated either new and modified or the same old and unmodified forms.
1228,"Species of the genus Lingula, for instance, must have continuously"
1228,"existed by an unbroken succession of generations, from the lowest"
1228,Silurian stratum to the present day.
1228,
1228,We have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group sometimes
1228,falsely appear to have come in abruptly; and I have attempted to give
1228,"an explanation of this fact, which if true would have been fatal to my"
1228,views. But such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being
1228,"a gradual increase in number, till the group reaches its maximum, and"
1228,"then, sooner or later, it gradually decreases. If the number of"
1228,"the species of a genus, or the number of the genera of a family, be"
1228,"represented by a vertical line of varying thickness, crossing the"
1228,"successive geological formations in which the species are found, the"
1228,"line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end, not in a"
1228,"sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens upwards, sometimes"
1228,"keeping for a space of equal thickness, and ultimately thins out in the"
1228,"upper beds, marking the decrease and final extinction of the species."
1228,This gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly
1228,"conformable with my theory; as the species of the same genus, and the"
1228,"genera of the same family, can increase only slowly and progressively;"
1228,for the process of modification and the production of a number of allied
1228,"forms must be slow and gradual,--one species giving rise first to two"
1228,"or three varieties, these being slowly converted into species, which in"
1228,"their turn produce by equally slow steps other species, and so on, like"
1228,"the branching of a great tree from a single stem, till the group becomes"
1228,large.
1228,
1228,ON EXTINCTION.
1228,
1228,We have as yet spoken only incidentally of the disappearance of species
1228,and of groups of species. On the theory of natural selection the
1228,extinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are
1228,intimately connected together. The old notion of all the inhabitants of
1228,"the earth having been swept away at successive periods by catastrophes,"
1228,"is very generally given up, even by those geologists, as Elie de"
1228,"Beaumont, Murchison, Barrande, etc., whose general views would naturally"
1228,"lead them to this conclusion. On the contrary, we have every reason to"
1228,"believe, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and"
1228,"groups of species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one"
1228,"spot, then from another, and finally from the world. Both single species"
1228,"and whole groups of species last for very unequal periods; some groups,"
1228,"as we have seen, having endured from the earliest known dawn of life"
1228,to the present day; some having disappeared before the close of the
1228,palaeozoic period. No fixed law seems to determine the length of time
1228,during which any single species or any single genus endures. There is
1228,reason to believe that the complete extinction of the species of a group
1228,is generally a slower process than their production: if the appearance
1228,"and disappearance of a group of species be represented, as before, by"
1228,"a vertical line of varying thickness, the line is found to taper more"
1228,"gradually at its upper end, which marks the progress of extermination,"
1228,"than at its lower end, which marks the first appearance and increase"
1228,"in numbers of the species. In some cases, however, the extermination"
1228,"of whole groups of beings, as of ammonites towards the close of the"
1228,"secondary period, has been wonderfully sudden."
1228,
1228,The whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in the
1228,most gratuitous mystery. Some authors have even supposed that as the
1228,"individual has a definite length of life, so have species a definite"
1228,duration. No one I think can have marvelled more at the extinction of
1228,"species, than I have done. When I found in La Plata the tooth of a horse"
1228,"embedded with the remains of Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon, and other"
1228,"extinct monsters, which all co-existed with still living shells at a"
1228,"very late geological period, I was filled with astonishment; for seeing"
1228,"that the horse, since its introduction by the Spaniards into South"
1228,"America, has run wild over the whole country and has increased in"
1228,"numbers at an unparalleled rate, I asked myself what could so recently"
1228,have exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparently
1228,so favourable. But how utterly groundless was my astonishment! Professor
1228,"Owen soon perceived that the tooth, though so like that of the existing"
1228,"horse, belonged to an extinct species. Had this horse been still"
1228,"living, but in some degree rare, no naturalist would have felt the least"
1228,surprise at its rarity; for rarity is the attribute of a vast number of
1228,"species of all classes, in all countries. If we ask ourselves why this"
1228,"or that species is rare, we answer that something is unfavourable in its"
1228,"conditions of life; but what that something is, we can hardly ever tell."
1228,"On the supposition of the fossil horse still existing as a rare species,"
1228,"we might have felt certain from the analogy of all other mammals,"
1228,"even of the slow-breeding elephant, and from the history of the"
1228,"naturalisation of the domestic horse in South America, that under more"
1228,favourable conditions it would in a very few years have stocked the
1228,whole continent. But we could not have told what the unfavourable
1228,"conditions were which checked its increase, whether some one or several"
1228,"contingencies, and at what period of the horse's life, and in what"
1228,"degree, they severally acted. If the conditions had gone on, however"
1228,"slowly, becoming less and less favourable, we assuredly should not have"
1228,"perceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would certainly have become"
1228,"rarer and rarer, and finally extinct;--its place being seized on by some"
1228,more successful competitor.
1228,
1228,It is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every
1228,living being is constantly being checked by unperceived injurious
1228,agencies; and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient
1228,"to cause rarity, and finally extinction. We see in many cases in the"
1228,"more recent tertiary formations, that rarity precedes extinction; and we"
1228,know that this has been the progress of events with those animals which
1228,"have been exterminated, either locally or wholly, through man's agency."
1228,"I may repeat what I published in , namely, that to admit that"
1228,species generally become rare before they become extinct--to feel no
1228,"surprise at the rarity of a species, and yet to marvel greatly when"
1228,"it ceases to exist, is much the same as to admit that sickness in the"
1228,"individual is the forerunner of death--to feel no surprise at sickness,"
1228,"but when the sick man dies, to wonder and to suspect that he died by"
1228,some unknown deed of violence.
1228,
1228,The theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new
1228,"variety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by"
1228,having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition;
1228,and the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably
1228,follows. It is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and
1228,"slightly improved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the"
1228,less improved varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it
1228,"is transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the"
1228,place of other breeds in other countries. Thus the appearance of new
1228,"forms and the disappearance of old forms, both natural and artificial,"
1228,"are bound together. In certain flourishing groups, the number of new"
1228,specific forms which have been produced within a given time is probably
1228,greater than that of the old forms which have been exterminated; but we
1228,"know that the number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing,"
1228,"at least during the later geological periods, so that looking to later"
1228,times we may believe that the production of new forms has caused the
1228,extinction of about the same number of old forms.
1228,
1228,"The competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained"
1228,"and illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each"
1228,other in all respects. Hence the improved and modified descendants of
1228,a species will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species;
1228,"and if many new forms have been developed from any one species, the"
1228,"nearest allies of that species, i.e. the species of the same genus, will"
1228,"be the most liable to extermination. Thus, as I believe, a number of"
1228,"new species descended from one species, that is a new genus, comes to"
1228,"supplant an old genus, belonging to the same family. But it must often"
1228,have happened that a new species belonging to some one group will have
1228,"seized on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group,"
1228,and thus caused its extermination; and if many allied forms be developed
1228,"from the successful intruder, many will have to yield their places; and"
1228,"it will generally be allied forms, which will suffer from some inherited"
1228,inferiority in common. But whether it be species belonging to the same
1228,"or to a distinct class, which yield their places to other species which"
1228,"have been modified and improved, a few of the sufferers may often long"
1228,"be preserved, from being fitted to some peculiar line of life, or from"
1228,"inhabiting some distant and isolated station, where they have escaped"
1228,"severe competition. For instance, a single species of Trigonia, a great"
1228,"genus of shells in the secondary formations, survives in the Australian"
1228,seas; and a few members of the great and almost extinct group of Ganoid
1228,fishes still inhabit our fresh waters. Therefore the utter extinction
1228,"of a group is generally, as we have seen, a slower process than its"
1228,production.
1228,
1228,With respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families
1228,"or orders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palaeozoic period and"
1228,"of Ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what"
1228,has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our
1228,consecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been much
1228,"slow extermination. Moreover, when by sudden immigration or by unusually"
1228,"rapid development, many species of a new group have taken possession"
1228,"of a new area, they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid"
1228,manner many of the old inhabitants; and the forms which thus yield
1228,"their places will commonly be allied, for they will partake of some"
1228,inferiority in common.
1228,
1228,"Thus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole"
1228,"groups of species become extinct, accords well with the theory of"
1228,natural selection. We need not marvel at extinction; if we must
1228,"marvel, let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we"
1228,"understand the many complex contingencies, on which the existence of"
1228,"each species depends. If we forget for an instant, that each species"
1228,"tends to increase inordinately, and that some check is always in action,"
1228,"yet seldom perceived by us, the whole economy of nature will be utterly"
1228,obscured. Whenever we can precisely say why this species is more
1228,abundant in individuals than that; why this species and not another
1228,"can be naturalised in a given country; then, and not till then, we may"
1228,justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of this
1228,particular species or group of species.
1228,
1228,ON THE FORMS OF LIFE CHANGING ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE
1228,WORLD.
1228,
1228,"Scarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than the fact,"
1228,that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the
1228,world. Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many
1228,"distant parts of the world, under the most different climates, where not"
1228,"a fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in North"
1228,"America, in equatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the"
1228,"Cape of Good Hope, and in the peninsula of India. For at these distant"
1228,"points, the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakeable"
1228,degree of resemblance to those of the Chalk. It is not that the same
1228,species are met with; for in some cases not one species is identically
1228,"the same, but they belong to the same families, genera, and sections"
1228,"of genera, and sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling"
1228,"points as mere superficial sculpture. Moreover other forms, which are"
1228,"not found in the Chalk of Europe, but which occur in the formations"
1228,"either above or below, are similarly absent at these distant points of"
1228,"the world. In the several successive palaeozoic formations of Russia,"
1228,"Western Europe and North America, a similar parallelism in the forms of"
1228,"life has been observed by several authors: so it is, according to Lyell,"
1228,with the several European and North American tertiary deposits. Even
1228,if the few fossil species which are common to the Old and New Worlds be
1228,"kept wholly out of view, the general parallelism in the successive forms"
1228,"of life, in the stages of the widely separated palaeozoic and tertiary"
1228,"periods, would still be manifest, and the several formations could be"
1228,easily correlated.
1228,
1228,"These observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of distant"
1228,parts of the world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the
1228,productions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points in
1228,the same parallel manner. We may doubt whether they have thus changed:
1228,"if the Megatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought"
1228,"to Europe from La Plata, without any information in regard to their"
1228,"geological position, no one would have suspected that they had coexisted"
1228,with still living sea-shells; but as these anomalous monsters coexisted
1228,"with the Mastodon and Horse, it might at least have been inferred that"
1228,they had lived during one of the latter tertiary stages.
1228,
1228,When the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed
1228,"simultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this"
1228,"expression relates to the same thousandth or hundred-thousandth year, or"
1228,even that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine
1228,"animals which live at the present day in Europe, and all those that"
1228,lived in Europe during the pleistocene period (an enormously remote
1228,"period as measured by years, including the whole glacial epoch), were to"
1228,"be compared with those now living in South America or in Australia, the"
1228,most skilful naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existing
1228,or the pleistocene inhabitants of Europe resembled most closely those of
1228,"the southern hemisphere. So, again, several highly competent observers"
1228,believe that the existing productions of the United States are more
1228,closely related to those which lived in Europe during certain later
1228,"tertiary stages, than to those which now live here; and if this be so,"
1228,it is evident that fossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on
1228,the shores of North America would hereafter be liable to be classed with
1228,"somewhat older European beds. Nevertheless, looking to a remotely future"
1228,"epoch, there can, I think, be little doubt that all the more modern"
1228,"MARINE formations, namely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene and"
1228,"strictly modern beds, of Europe, North and South America, and Australia,"
1228,"from containing fossil remains in some degree allied, and from not"
1228,including those forms which are only found in the older underlying
1228,"deposits, would be correctly ranked as simultaneous in a geological"
1228,sense.
1228,
1228,"The fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously, in the above"
1228,"large sense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck those"
1228,"admirable observers, MM. de Verneuil and d'Archiac. After referring"
1228,to the parallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life in various parts
1228,"of Europe, they add, ""If struck by this strange sequence, we turn our"
1228,"attention to North America, and there discover a series of analogous"
1228,"phenomena, it will appear certain that all these modifications of"
1228,"species, their extinction, and the introduction of new ones, cannot be"
1228,owing to mere changes in marine currents or other causes more or less
1228,"local and temporary, but depend on general laws which govern the whole"
1228,"animal kingdom."" M. Barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the"
1228,"same effect. It is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of currents,"
1228,"climate, or other physical conditions, as the cause of these great"
1228,"mutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the most"
1228,"different climates. We must, as Barrande has remarked, look to some"
1228,special law. We shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present
1228,"distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the relation"
1228,"between the physical conditions of various countries, and the nature of"
1228,their inhabitants.
1228,
1228,This great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life
1228,"throughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural selection."
1228,"New species are formed by new varieties arising, which have some"
1228,"advantage over older forms; and those forms, which are already dominant,"
1228,"or have some advantage over the other forms in their own country, would"
1228,naturally oftenest give rise to new varieties or incipient species; for
1228,these latter must be victorious in a still higher degree in order to be
1228,"preserved and to survive. We have distinct evidence on this head, in"
1228,"the plants which are dominant, that is, which are commonest in their own"
1228,"homes, and are most widely diffused, having produced the greatest number"
1228,"of new varieties. It is also natural that the dominant, varying, and"
1228,"far-spreading species, which already have invaded to a certain extent"
1228,"the territories of other species, should be those which would have"
1228,"the best chance of spreading still further, and of giving rise in new"
1228,countries to new varieties and species. The process of diffusion
1228,"may often be very slow, being dependent on climatal and geographical"
1228,"changes, or on strange accidents, but in the long run the dominant"
1228,"forms will generally succeed in spreading. The diffusion would, it"
1228,"is probable, be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct"
1228,continents than with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea. We
1228,"might therefore expect to find, as we apparently do find, a less strict"
1228,degree of parallel succession in the productions of the land than of the
1228,sea.
1228,
1228,Dominant species spreading from any region might encounter still more
1228,"dominant species, and then their triumphant course, or even their"
1228,"existence, would cease. We know not at all precisely what are all the"
1228,conditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant
1228,"species; but we can, I think, clearly see that a number of individuals,"
1228,"from giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations,"
1228,"and that severe competition with many already existing forms, would"
1228,"be highly favourable, as would be the power of spreading into new"
1228,"territories. A certain amount of isolation, recurring at long intervals"
1228,"of time, would probably be also favourable, as before explained. One"
1228,quarter of the world may have been most favourable for the production
1228,"of new and dominant species on the land, and another for those in the"
1228,waters of the sea. If two great regions had been for a long period
1228,"favourably circumstanced in an equal degree, whenever their inhabitants"
1228,"met, the battle would be prolonged and severe; and some from one"
1228,birthplace and some from the other might be victorious. But in the
1228,"course of time, the forms dominant in the highest degree, wherever"
1228,"produced, would tend everywhere to prevail. As they prevailed, they"
1228,would cause the extinction of other and inferior forms; and as these
1228,"inferior forms would be allied in groups by inheritance, whole groups"
1228,would tend slowly to disappear; though here and there a single member
1228,might long be enabled to survive.
1228,
1228,"Thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense,"
1228,"simultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the world,"
1228,accords well with the principle of new species having been formed by
1228,dominant species spreading widely and varying; the new species thus
1228,"produced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance, and to having"
1228,already had some advantage over their parents or over other species;
1228,"these again spreading, varying, and producing new species. The forms"
1228,which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious
1228,"forms, will generally be allied in groups, from inheriting some"
1228,inferiority in common; and therefore as new and improved groups spread
1228,"throughout the world, old groups will disappear from the world; and the"
1228,succession of forms in both ways will everywhere tend to correspond.
1228,
1228,There is one other remark connected with this subject worth making. I
1228,have given my reasons for believing that all our greater fossiliferous
1228,formations were deposited during periods of subsidence; and that blank
1228,intervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed of
1228,"the sea was either stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was"
1228,not thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains.
1228,During these long and blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants
1228,of each region underwent a considerable amount of modification and
1228,"extinction, and that there was much migration from other parts of the"
1228,world. As we have reason to believe that large areas are affected by the
1228,"same movement, it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations"
1228,have often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter
1228,of the world; but we are far from having any right to conclude that this
1228,"has invariably been the case, and that large areas have invariably been"
1228,affected by the same movements. When two formations have been deposited
1228,"in two regions during nearly, but not exactly the same period, we should"
1228,"find in both, from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs, the"
1228,same general succession in the forms of life; but the species would not
1228,exactly correspond; for there will have been a little more time in
1228,"the one region than in the other for modification, extinction, and"
1228,immigration.
1228,
1228,I suspect that cases of this nature have occurred in Europe. Mr.
1228,"Prestwich, in his admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England"
1228,"and France, is able to draw a close general parallelism between the"
1228,successive stages in the two countries; but when he compares certain
1228,"stages in England with those in France, although he finds in both a"
1228,curious accordance in the numbers of the species belonging to the same
1228,"genera, yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficult"
1228,"to account for, considering the proximity of the two areas,--unless,"
1228,"indeed, it be assumed that an isthmus separated two seas inhabited"
1228,"by distinct, but contemporaneous, faunas. Lyell has made similar"
1228,"observations on some of the later tertiary formations. Barrande, also,"
1228,shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successive
1228,Silurian deposits of Bohemia and Scandinavia; nevertheless he finds
1228,a surprising amount of difference in the species. If the several
1228,formations in these regions have not been deposited during the same
1228,"exact periods,--a formation in one region often corresponding with a"
1228,"blank interval in the other,--and if in both regions the species"
1228,have gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the several
1228,formations and during the long intervals of time between them; in this
1228,"case, the several formations in the two regions could be arranged in"
1228,"the same order, in accordance with the general succession of the form"
1228,"of life, and the order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel;"
1228,nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the apparently
1228,corresponding stages in the two regions.
1228,
1228,"ON THE AFFINITIES OF EXTINCT SPECIES TO EACH OTHER, AND TO LIVING FORMS."
1228,
1228,Let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species.
1228,They all fall into one grand natural system; and this fact is at once
1228,"explained on the principle of descent. The more ancient any form is, the"
1228,"more, as a general rule, it differs from living forms. But, as Buckland"
1228,"long ago remarked, all fossils can be classed either in still existing"
1228,"groups, or between them. That the extinct forms of life help to fill up"
1228,"the wide intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, cannot"
1228,be disputed. For if we confine our attention either to the living or
1228,"to the extinct alone, the series is far less perfect than if we combine"
1228,"both into one general system. With respect to the Vertebrata, whole"
1228,pages could be filled with striking illustrations from our great
1228,"palaeontologist, Owen, showing how extinct animals fall in between"
1228,"existing groups. Cuvier ranked the Ruminants and Pachyderms, as the two"
1228,most distinct orders of mammals; but Owen has discovered so many fossil
1228,"links, that he has had to alter the whole classification of these two"
1228,orders; and has placed certain pachyderms in the same sub-order with
1228,"ruminants: for example, he dissolves by fine gradations the apparently"
1228,wide difference between the pig and the camel. In regard to the
1228,"Invertebrata, Barrande, and a higher authority could not be named,"
1228,"asserts that he is every day taught that palaeozoic animals, though"
1228,"belonging to the same orders, families, or genera with those living at"
1228,"the present day, were not at this early epoch limited in such distinct"
1228,groups as they now are.
1228,
1228,Some writers have objected to any extinct species or group of species
1228,being considered as intermediate between living species or groups. If by
1228,this term it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in
1228,"all its characters between two living forms, the objection is probably"
1228,valid. But I apprehend that in a perfectly natural classification many
1228,"fossil species would have to stand between living species, and some"
1228,"extinct genera between living genera, even between genera belonging to"
1228,"distinct families. The most common case, especially with respect to very"
1228,"distinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be, that supposing"
1228,them to be distinguished at the present day from each other by a
1228,"dozen characters, the ancient members of the same two groups would be"
1228,"distinguished by a somewhat lesser number of characters, so that the two"
1228,"groups, though formerly quite distinct, at that period made some small"
1228,approach to each other.
1228,
1228,"It is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much the"
1228,more it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely
1228,separated from each other. This remark no doubt must be restricted
1228,to those groups which have undergone much change in the course of
1228,geological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the truth of
1228,"the proposition, for every now and then even a living animal, as the"
1228,"Lepidosiren, is discovered having affinities directed towards very"
1228,"distinct groups. Yet if we compare the older Reptiles and Batrachians,"
1228,"the older Fish, the older Cephalopods, and the eocene Mammals, with the"
1228,"more recent members of the same classes, we must admit that there is"
1228,some truth in the remark.
1228,
1228,Let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the
1228,"theory of descent with modification. As the subject is somewhat complex,"
1228,I must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter.
1228,"We may suppose that the numbered letters represent genera, and the"
1228,dotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus. The diagram
1228,"is much too simple, too few genera and too few species being given,"
1228,but this is unimportant for us. The horizontal lines may represent
1228,"successive geological formations, and all the forms beneath the"
1228,"uppermost line may be considered as extinct. The three existing genera,"
1228,"a, q, p, will form a small family; b and f a closely allied"
1228,"family or sub-family; and o, e, m, a third family. These three"
1228,"families, together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of"
1228,"descent diverging from the parent-form A, will form an order; for all"
1228,will have inherited something in common from their ancient and common
1228,progenitor. On the principle of the continued tendency to divergence
1228,"of character, which was formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more"
1228,"recent any form is, the more it will generally differ from its ancient"
1228,progenitor. Hence we can understand the rule that the most ancient
1228,"fossils differ most from existing forms. We must not, however, assume"
1228,that divergence of character is a necessary contingency; it depends
1228,solely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize
1228,on many and different places in the economy of nature. Therefore it is
1228,"quite possible, as we have seen in the case of some Silurian forms,"
1228,that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its
1228,"slightly altered conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast"
1228,period the same general characteristics. This is represented in the
1228,diagram by the letter F.
1228,
1228,"All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from A, make, as"
1228,"before remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects"
1228,"of extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into"
1228,"several sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have"
1228,"perished at different periods, and some to have endured to the present"
1228,day.
1228,
1228,"By looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms,"
1228,"supposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered"
1228,"at several points low down in the series, the three existing families on"
1228,"the uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other. If,"
1228,"for instance, the genera a, a, a, f, m, m, m were disinterred,"
1228,these three families would be so closely linked together that they
1228,"probably would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the"
1228,same manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms. Yet he who
1228,"objected to call the extinct genera, which thus linked the living"
1228,"genera of three families together, intermediate in character, would be"
1228,"justified, as they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long"
1228,and circuitous course through many widely different forms. If many
1228,extinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal
1228,"lines or geological formations--for instance, above Number VI.--but"
1228,"none from beneath this line, then only the two families on the left"
1228,"hand (namely, a, etc., and b, etc.) would have to be united into"
1228,"one family; and the two other families (namely, a to f now including"
1228,"five genera, and o to m) would yet remain distinct. These two"
1228,"families, however, would be less distinct from each other than they were"
1228,"before the discovery of the fossils. If, for instance, we suppose the"
1228,existing genera of the two families to differ from each other by a dozen
1228,"characters, in this case the genera, at the early period marked VI.,"
1228,would differ by a lesser number of characters; for at this early
1228,stage of descent they have not diverged in character from the common
1228,"progenitor of the order, nearly so much as they subsequently diverged."
1228,Thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in some slight
1228,"degree intermediate in character between their modified descendants, or"
1228,between their collateral relations.
1228,
1228,In nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented in
1228,"the diagram; for the groups will have been more numerous, they will"
1228,"have endured for extremely unequal lengths of time, and will have been"
1228,modified in various degrees. As we possess only the last volume of the
1228,"geological record, and that in a very broken condition, we have no right"
1228,"to expect, except in very rare cases, to fill up wide intervals in the"
1228,"natural system, and thus unite distinct families or orders. All that we"
1228,"have a right to expect, is that those groups, which have within known"
1228,"geological periods undergone much modification, should in the older"
1228,formations make some slight approach to each other; so that the older
1228,members should differ less from each other in some of their characters
1228,than do the existing members of the same groups; and this by the
1228,concurrent evidence of our best palaeontologists seems frequently to be
1228,the case.
1228,
1228,"Thus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts with"
1228,respect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each
1228,"other and to living forms, seem to me explained in a satisfactory"
1228,manner. And they are wholly inexplicable on any other view.
1228,
1228,"On this same theory, it is evident that the fauna of any great period"
1228,in the earth's history will be intermediate in general character between
1228,"that which preceded and that which succeeded it. Thus, the species"
1228,which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram are the
1228,"modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and are the"
1228,parents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage;
1228,hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character
1228,"between the forms of life above and below. We must, however, allow for"
1228,"the entire extinction of some preceding forms, and for the coming in of"
1228,"quite new forms by immigration, and for a large amount of modification,"
1228,during the long and blank intervals between the successive formations.
1228,"Subject to these allowances, the fauna of each geological period"
1228,"undoubtedly is intermediate in character, between the preceding and"
1228,"succeeding faunas. I need give only one instance, namely, the manner"
1228,"in which the fossils of the Devonian system, when this system was first"
1228,"discovered, were at once recognised by palaeontologists as intermediate"
1228,"in character between those of the overlying carboniferous, and"
1228,underlying Silurian system. But each fauna is not necessarily exactly
1228,"intermediate, as unequal intervals of time have elapsed between"
1228,consecutive formations.
1228,
1228,"It is no real objection to the truth of the statement, that the fauna of"
1228,each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the
1228,"preceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions"
1228,"to the rule. For instance, mastodons and elephants, when arranged by Dr."
1228,"Falconer in two series, first according to their mutual affinities"
1228,"and then according to their periods of existence, do not accord in"
1228,"arrangement. The species extreme in character are not the oldest, or"
1228,"the most recent; nor are those which are intermediate in character,"
1228,"intermediate in age. But supposing for an instant, in this and other"
1228,"such cases, that the record of the first appearance and disappearance"
1228,"of the species was perfect, we have no reason to believe that forms"
1228,successively produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of
1228,time: a very ancient form might occasionally last much longer than
1228,"a form elsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of"
1228,terrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts. To compare small
1228,things with great: if the principal living and extinct races of the
1228,domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be in serial
1228,"affinity, this arrangement would not closely accord with the order"
1228,"in time of their production, and still less with the order of their"
1228,disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon now lives; and many varieties
1228,between the rock-pigeon and the carrier have become extinct; and
1228,carriers which are extreme in the important character of length of beak
1228,"originated earlier than short-beaked tumblers, which are at the opposite"
1228,end of the series in this same respect.
1228,
1228,"Closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an"
1228,"intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character,"
1228,"is the fact, insisted on by all palaeontologists, that fossils from two"
1228,"consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other, than"
1228,are the fossils from two remote formations. Pictet gives as a well-known
1228,"instance, the general resemblance of the organic remains from the"
1228,"several stages of the chalk formation, though the species are distinct"
1228,"in each stage. This fact alone, from its generality, seems to have"
1228,shaken Professor Pictet in his firm belief in the immutability of
1228,species. He who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species
1228,"over the globe, will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of"
1228,"the distinct species in closely consecutive formations, by the physical"
1228,conditions of the ancient areas having remained nearly the same. Let it
1228,"be remembered that the forms of life, at least those inhabiting the sea,"
1228,"have changed almost simultaneously throughout the world, and therefore"
1228,under the most different climates and conditions. Consider the
1228,"prodigious vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene period, which"
1228,"includes the whole glacial period, and note how little the specific"
1228,forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been affected.
1228,
1228,"On the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fact of fossil remains"
1228,"from closely consecutive formations, though ranked as distinct species,"
1228,"being closely related, is obvious. As the accumulation of each formation"
1228,"has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened"
1228,"between successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as I"
1228,"attempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or two formations all"
1228,the intermediate varieties between the species which appeared at the
1228,commencement and close of these periods; but we ought to find after
1228,"intervals, very long as measured by years, but only moderately long"
1228,"as measured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as they have been"
1228,"called by some authors, representative species; and these we assuredly"
1228,"do find. We find, in short, such evidence of the slow and scarcely"
1228,"sensible mutation of specific forms, as we have a just right to expect"
1228,to find.
1228,
1228,ON THE STATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF ANCIENT FORMS.
1228,
1228,There has been much discussion whether recent forms are more highly
1228,"developed than ancient. I will not here enter on this subject, for"
1228,naturalists have not as yet defined to each other's satisfaction what is
1228,meant by high and low forms. But in one particular sense the more recent
1228,"forms must, on my theory, be higher than the more ancient; for each new"
1228,species is formed by having had some advantage in the struggle for life
1228,"over other and preceding forms. If under a nearly similar climate, the"
1228,eocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world were put into competition
1228,"with the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter, the"
1228,eocene fauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated;
1228,"as would a secondary fauna by an eocene, and a palaeozoic fauna by a"
1228,secondary fauna. I do not doubt that this process of improvement has
1228,affected in a marked and sensible manner the organisation of the more
1228,"recent and victorious forms of life, in comparison with the ancient and"
1228,beaten forms; but I can see no way of testing this sort of progress.
1228,"Crustaceans, for instance, not the highest in their own class, may have"
1228,beaten the highest molluscs. From the extraordinary manner in which
1228,"European productions have recently spread over New Zealand, and have"
1228,"seized on places which must have been previously occupied, we may"
1228,"believe, if all the animals and plants of Great Britain were set free"
1228,"in New Zealand, that in the course of time a multitude of British forms"
1228,"would become thoroughly naturalized there, and would exterminate many"
1228,"of the natives. On the other hand, from what we see now occurring in New"
1228,"Zealand, and from hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere"
1228,"having become wild in any part of Europe, we may doubt, if all the"
1228,"productions of New Zealand were set free in Great Britain, whether any"
1228,considerable number would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by
1228,"our native plants and animals. Under this point of view, the productions"
1228,of Great Britain may be said to be higher than those of New Zealand. Yet
1228,the most skilful naturalist from an examination of the species of the
1228,two countries could not have foreseen this result.
1228,
1228,Agassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the
1228,embryos of recent animals of the same classes; or that the geological
1228,succession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to the
1228,embryological development of recent forms. I must follow Pictet and
1228,Huxley in thinking that the truth of this doctrine is very far from
1228,"proved. Yet I fully expect to see it hereafter confirmed, at least in"
1228,"regard to subordinate groups, which have branched off from each other"
1228,within comparatively recent times. For this doctrine of Agassiz accords
1228,well with the theory of natural selection. In a future chapter I
1228,"shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its embryo, owing"
1228,"to variations supervening at a not early age, and being inherited at"
1228,"a corresponding age. This process, whilst it leaves the embryo almost"
1228,"unaltered, continually adds, in the course of successive generations,"
1228,more and more difference to the adult.
1228,
1228,"Thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by"
1228,"nature, of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal. This"
1228,"view may be true, and yet it may never be capable of full proof. Seeing,"
1228,"for instance, that the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fish strictly"
1228,"belong to their own proper classes, though some of these old forms are"
1228,in a slight degree less distinct from each other than are the typical
1228,"members of the same groups at the present day, it would be vain to look"
1228,"for animals having the common embryological character of the Vertebrata,"
1228,until beds far beneath the lowest Silurian strata are discovered--a
1228,discovery of which the chance is very small.
1228,
1228,"ON THE SUCCESSION OF THE SAME TYPES WITHIN THE SAME AREAS, DURING THE"
1228,LATER TERTIARY PERIODS.
1228,
1228,Mr. Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the
1228,Australian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that
1228,"continent. In South America, a similar relationship is manifest, even"
1228,"to an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour like those of the"
1228,"armadillo, found in several parts of La Plata; and Professor Owen has"
1228,"shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals,"
1228,"buried there in such numbers, are related to South American types. This"
1228,relationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of
1228,fossil bones made by MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil. I was
1228,"so much impressed with these facts that I strongly insisted, in "
1228,"and , on this ""law of the succession of types,""--on ""this wonderful"
1228,"relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living."""
1228,Professor Owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to
1228,the mammals of the Old World. We see the same law in this author's
1228,restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of New Zealand. We see
1228,it also in the birds of the caves of Brazil. Mr. Woodward has shown that
1228,"the same law holds good with sea-shells, but from the wide distribution"
1228,"of most genera of molluscs, it is not well displayed by them. Other"
1228,"cases could be added, as the relation between the extinct and"
1228,living land-shells of Madeira; and between the extinct and living
1228,brackish-water shells of the Aralo-Caspian Sea.
1228,
1228,Now what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types
1228,"within the same areas mean? He would be a bold man, who after comparing"
1228,the present climate of Australia and of parts of South America under the
1228,"same latitude, would attempt to account, on the one hand, by dissimilar"
1228,physical conditions for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these
1228,"two continents, and, on the other hand, by similarity of conditions,"
1228,for the uniformity of the same types in each during the later tertiary
1228,periods. Nor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that
1228,marsupials should have been chiefly or solely produced in Australia; or
1228,that Edentata and other American types should have been solely produced
1228,in South America. For we know that Europe in ancient times was peopled
1228,by numerous marsupials; and I have shown in the publications above
1228,"alluded to, that in America the law of distribution of terrestrial"
1228,mammals was formerly different from what it now is. North America
1228,formerly partook strongly of the present character of the southern
1228,half of the continent; and the southern half was formerly more closely
1228,"allied, than it is at present, to the northern half. In a similar manner"
1228,"we know from Falconer and Cautley's discoveries, that northern India was"
1228,formerly more closely related in its mammals to Africa than it is at
1228,the present time. Analogous facts could be given in relation to the
1228,distribution of marine animals.
1228,
1228,"On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long"
1228,"enduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the"
1228,"same areas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of each quarter of"
1228,"the world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter, during the next"
1228,"succeeding period of time, closely allied though in some degree modified"
1228,descendants. If the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed
1228,"greatly from those of another continent, so will their modified"
1228,descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree. But
1228,"after very long intervals of time and after great geographical changes,"
1228,"permitting much inter-migration, the feebler will yield to the more"
1228,"dominant forms, and there will be nothing immutable in the laws of past"
1228,and present distribution.
1228,
1228,"It may be asked in ridicule, whether I suppose that the megatherium and"
1228,other allied huge monsters have left behind them in South America the
1228,"sloth, armadillo, and anteater, as their degenerate descendants. This"
1228,cannot for an instant be admitted. These huge animals have become wholly
1228,"extinct, and have left no progeny. But in the caves of Brazil, there"
1228,are many extinct species which are closely allied in size and in other
1228,characters to the species still living in South America; and some of
1228,these fossils may be the actual progenitors of living species. It must
1228,"not be forgotten that, on my theory, all the species of the same genus"
1228,"have descended from some one species; so that if six genera, each having"
1228,"eight species, be found in one geological formation, and in the next"
1228,succeeding formation there be six other allied or representative genera
1228,"with the same number of species, then we may conclude that only one"
1228,"species of each of the six older genera has left modified descendants,"
1228,constituting the six new genera. The other seven species of the old
1228,"genera have all died out and have left no progeny. Or, which would"
1228,"probably be a far commoner case, two or three species of two or three"
1228,alone of the six older genera will have been the parents of the six new
1228,genera; the other old species and the other whole genera having
1228,"become utterly extinct. In failing orders, with the genera and species"
1228,"decreasing in numbers, as apparently is the case of the Edentata of"
1228,"South America, still fewer genera and species will have left modified"
1228,blood-descendants.
1228,
1228,SUMMARY OF THE PRECEDING AND PRESENT CHAPTERS.
1228,
1228,I have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely
1228,imperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically
1228,explored with care; that only certain classes of organic beings have
1228,been largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number both of
1228,"specimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is absolutely as"
1228,nothing compared with the incalculable number of generations which
1228,"must have passed away even during a single formation; that, owing"
1228,to subsidence being necessary for the accumulation of fossiliferous
1228,"deposits thick enough to resist future degradation, enormous intervals"
1228,of time have elapsed between the successive formations; that there has
1228,"probably been more extinction during the periods of subsidence, and more"
1228,"variation during the periods of elevation, and during the latter the"
1228,record will have been least perfectly kept; that each single formation
1228,has not been continuously deposited; that the duration of each formation
1228,"is, perhaps, short compared with the average duration of specific forms;"
1228,that migration has played an important part in the first appearance of
1228,new forms in any one area and formation; that widely ranging species
1228,"are those which have varied most, and have oftenest given rise to new"
1228,species; and that varieties have at first often been local. All these
1228,"causes taken conjointly, must have tended to make the geological record"
1228,"extremely imperfect, and will to a large extent explain why we do not"
1228,"find interminable varieties, connecting together all the extinct and"
1228,existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps.
1228,
1228,"He who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will"
1228,rightly reject my whole theory. For he may ask in vain where are the
1228,numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the
1228,"closely allied or representative species, found in the several stages of"
1228,the same great formation. He may disbelieve in the enormous intervals
1228,of time which have elapsed between our consecutive formations; he may
1228,"overlook how important a part migration must have played, when the"
1228,"formations of any one great region alone, as that of Europe, are"
1228,"considered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent, sudden"
1228,coming in of whole groups of species. He may ask where are the remains
1228,of those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long
1228,before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited: I can answer
1228,"this latter question only hypothetically, by saying that as far as we"
1228,"can see, where our oceans now extend they have for an enormous period"
1228,"extended, and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood"
1228,"ever since the Silurian epoch; but that long before that period, the"
1228,world may have presented a wholly different aspect; and that the older
1228,"continents, formed of formations older than any known to us, may now all"
1228,"be in a metamorphosed condition, or may lie buried under the ocean."
1228,
1228,"Passing from these difficulties, all the other great leading facts in"
1228,palaeontology seem to me simply to follow on the theory of descent with
1228,modification through natural selection. We can thus understand how it
1228,is that new species come in slowly and successively; how species of
1228,"different classes do not necessarily change together, or at the same"
1228,"rate, or in the same degree; yet in the long run that all undergo"
1228,modification to some extent. The extinction of old forms is the almost
1228,inevitable consequence of the production of new forms. We can understand
1228,why when a species has once disappeared it never reappears. Groups of
1228,"species increase in numbers slowly, and endure for unequal periods of"
1228,"time; for the process of modification is necessarily slow, and depends"
1228,on many complex contingencies. The dominant species of the larger
1228,"dominant groups tend to leave many modified descendants, and thus new"
1228,"sub-groups and groups are formed. As these are formed, the species of"
1228,"the less vigorous groups, from their inferiority inherited from a common"
1228,"progenitor, tend to become extinct together, and to leave no modified"
1228,offspring on the face of the earth. But the utter extinction of a whole
1228,"group of species may often be a very slow process, from the survival of"
1228,"a few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated situations. When"
1228,"a group has once wholly disappeared, it does not reappear; for the link"
1228,of generation has been broken.
1228,
1228,"We can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life, which"
1228,"are those that oftenest vary, will in the long run tend to people the"
1228,"world with allied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally"
1228,succeed in taking the places of those groups of species which are their
1228,"inferiors in the struggle for existence. Hence, after long intervals"
1228,"of time, the productions of the world will appear to have changed"
1228,simultaneously.
1228,
1228,"We can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and"
1228,"recent, make together one grand system; for all are connected by"
1228,"generation. We can understand, from the continued tendency to divergence"
1228,"of character, why the more ancient a form is, the more it generally"
1228,differs from those now living. Why ancient and extinct forms often tend
1228,"to fill up gaps between existing forms, sometimes blending two groups"
1228,previously classed as distinct into one; but more commonly only bringing
1228,"them a little closer together. The more ancient a form is, the more"
1228,"often, apparently, it displays characters in some degree intermediate"
1228,"between groups now distinct; for the more ancient a form is, the more"
1228,"nearly it will be related to, and consequently resemble, the common"
1228,"progenitor of groups, since become widely divergent. Extinct forms"
1228,are seldom directly intermediate between existing forms; but are
1228,intermediate only by a long and circuitous course through many extinct
1228,and very different forms. We can clearly see why the organic remains of
1228,"closely consecutive formations are more closely allied to each other,"
1228,than are those of remote formations; for the forms are more closely
1228,linked together by generation: we can clearly see why the remains of an
1228,intermediate formation are intermediate in character.
1228,
1228,The inhabitants of each successive period in the world's history have
1228,"beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so far,"
1228,higher in the scale of nature; and this may account for that vague yet
1228,"ill-defined sentiment, felt by many palaeontologists, that organisation"
1228,on the whole has progressed. If it should hereafter be proved that
1228,ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of more recent
1228,"animals of the same class, the fact will be intelligible. The succession"
1228,of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later
1228,"geological periods ceases to be mysterious, and is simply explained by"
1228,inheritance.
1228,
1228,"If then the geological record be as imperfect as I believe it to be, and"
1228,it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much
1228,"more perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural selection are"
1228,"greatly diminished or disappear. On the other hand, all the chief laws"
1228,"of palaeontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species have"
1228,been produced by ordinary generation: old forms having been supplanted
1228,"by new and improved forms of life, produced by the laws of variation"
1228,"still acting round us, and preserved by Natural Selection."

1228,. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.
1228,
1228,Present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical
1228,conditions. Importance of barriers. Affinity of the productions of the
1228,"same continent. Centres of creation. Means of dispersal, by changes of"
1228,"climate and of the level of the land, and by occasional means. Dispersal"
1228,during the Glacial period co-extensive with the world.
1228,
1228,In considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of
1228,"the globe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the"
1228,similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions
1228,can be accounted for by their climatal and other physical conditions. Of
1228,"late, almost every author who has studied the subject has come to this"
1228,conclusion. The case of America alone would almost suffice to prove its
1228,truth: for if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar land
1228,"is almost continuous, all authors agree that one of the most fundamental"
1228,divisions in geographical distribution is that between the New and Old
1228,"Worlds; yet if we travel over the vast American continent, from the"
1228,"central parts of the United States to its extreme southern point, we"
1228,"meet with the most diversified conditions; the most humid districts,"
1228,"arid deserts, lofty mountains, grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes,"
1228,"and great rivers, under almost every temperature. There is hardly a"
1228,climate or condition in the Old World which cannot be paralleled in the
1228,New--at least as closely as the same species generally require; for it
1228,is a most rare case to find a group of organisms confined to any small
1228,"spot, having conditions peculiar in only a slight degree; for instance,"
1228,small areas in the Old World could be pointed out hotter than any in
1228,"the New World, yet these are not inhabited by a peculiar fauna or flora."
1228,Notwithstanding this parallelism in the conditions of the Old and New
1228,"Worlds, how widely different are their living productions!"
1228,
1228,"In the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land in"
1228,"Australia, South Africa, and western South America, between latitudes"
1228," deg and  deg, we shall find parts extremely similar in all their"
1228,"conditions, yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas and"
1228,floras more utterly dissimilar. Or again we may compare the productions
1228,"of South America south of lat.  deg with those north of  deg, which"
1228,"consequently inhabit a considerably different climate, and they will be"
1228,"found incomparably more closely related to each other, than they are to"
1228,the productions of Australia or Africa under nearly the same climate.
1228,Analogous facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of the
1228,sea.
1228,
1228,"A second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, that"
1228,"barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a"
1228,close and important manner to the differences between the productions of
1228,various regions. We see this in the great difference of nearly all the
1228,"terrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds, excepting in the"
1228,"northern parts, where the land almost joins, and where, under a slightly"
1228,"different climate, there might have been free migration for the northern"
1228,"temperate forms, as there now is for the strictly arctic productions."
1228,We see the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of
1228,"Australia, Africa, and South America under the same latitude: for these"
1228,countries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible. On
1228,"each continent, also, we see the same fact; for on the opposite sides"
1228,"of lofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and of great deserts, and"
1228,"sometimes even of large rivers, we find different productions; though as"
1228,"mountain chains, deserts, etc., are not as impassable, or likely to have"
1228,"endured so long as the oceans separating continents, the differences are"
1228,very inferior in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents.
1228,
1228,"Turning to the sea, we find the same law. No two marine faunas are more"
1228,"distinct, with hardly a fish, shell, or crab in common, than those of"
1228,the eastern and western shores of South and Central America; yet these
1228,"great faunas are separated only by the narrow, but impassable, isthmus"
1228,"of Panama. Westward of the shores of America, a wide space of open ocean"
1228,"extends, with not an island as a halting-place for emigrants; here we"
1228,"have a barrier of another kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet"
1228,"in the eastern islands of the Pacific, with another and totally"
1228,distinct fauna. So that here three marine faunas range far northward
1228,"and southward, in parallel lines not far from each other, under"
1228,corresponding climates; but from being separated from each other
1228,"by impassable barriers, either of land or open sea, they are wholly"
1228,"distinct. On the other hand, proceeding still further westward from the"
1228,"eastern islands of the tropical parts of the Pacific, we encounter no"
1228,"impassable barriers, and we have innumerable islands as halting-places,"
1228,until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to the shores of
1228,Africa; and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined and
1228,"distinct marine faunas. Although hardly one shell, crab or fish is"
1228,common to the above-named three approximate faunas of Eastern and
1228,"Western America and the eastern Pacific islands, yet many fish range"
1228,"from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean, and many shells are common to"
1228,"the eastern islands of the Pacific and the eastern shores of Africa, on"
1228,almost exactly opposite meridians of longitude.
1228,
1228,"A third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statements, is the"
1228,"affinity of the productions of the same continent or sea, though the"
1228,species themselves are distinct at different points and stations. It is
1228,"a law of the widest generality, and every continent offers innumerable"
1228,"instances. Nevertheless the naturalist in travelling, for instance,"
1228,from north to south never fails to be struck by the manner in which
1228,"successive groups of beings, specifically distinct, yet clearly related,"
1228,"replace each other. He hears from closely allied, yet distinct kinds of"
1228,"birds, notes nearly similar, and sees their nests similarly constructed,"
1228,"but not quite alike, with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner. The"
1228,plains near the Straits of Magellan are inhabited by one species of
1228,"Rhea (American ostrich), and northward the plains of La Plata by another"
1228,"species of the same genus; and not by a true ostrich or emeu, like those"
1228,found in Africa and Australia under the same latitude. On these same
1228,"plains of La Plata, we see the agouti and bizcacha, animals having"
1228,nearly the same habits as our hares and rabbits and belonging to the
1228,"same order of Rodents, but they plainly display an American type of"
1228,structure. We ascend the lofty peaks of the Cordillera and we find an
1228,"alpine species of bizcacha; we look to the waters, and we do not find"
1228,"the beaver or musk-rat, but the coypu and capybara, rodents of the"
1228,American type. Innumerable other instances could be given. If we look
1228,"to the islands off the American shore, however much they may differ in"
1228,"geological structure, the inhabitants, though they may be all peculiar"
1228,"species, are essentially American. We may look back to past ages, as"
1228,"shown in the last chapter, and we find American types then prevalent on"
1228,the American continent and in the American seas. We see in these facts
1228,"some deep organic bond, prevailing throughout space and time, over"
1228,"the same areas of land and water, and independent of their physical"
1228,"conditions. The naturalist must feel little curiosity, who is not led to"
1228,inquire what this bond is.
1228,
1228,"This bond, on my theory, is simply inheritance, that cause which alone,"
1228,"as far as we positively know, produces organisms quite like, or, as we"
1228,see in the case of varieties nearly like each other. The dissimilarity
1228,of the inhabitants of different regions may be attributed to
1228,"modification through natural selection, and in a quite subordinate"
1228,degree to the direct influence of different physical conditions.
1228,The degree of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more
1228,dominant forms of life from one region into another having been effected
1228,"with more or less ease, at periods more or less remote;--on the nature"
1228,"and number of the former immigrants;--and on their action and reaction,"
1228,in their mutual struggles for life;--the relation of organism to
1228,"organism being, as I have already often remarked, the most important of"
1228,all relations. Thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by
1228,checking migration; as does time for the slow process of modification
1228,"through natural selection. Widely-ranging species, abounding in"
1228,"individuals, which have already triumphed over many competitors in their"
1228,own widely-extended homes will have the best chance of seizing on new
1228,"places, when they spread into new countries. In their new homes they"
1228,"will be exposed to new conditions, and will frequently undergo further"
1228,modification and improvement; and thus they will become still further
1228,"victorious, and will produce groups of modified descendants. On this"
1228,"principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is"
1228,"that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to"
1228,"the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case."
1228,
1228,"I believe, as was remarked in the last chapter, in no law of necessary"
1228,development. As the variability of each species is an independent
1228,"property, and will be taken advantage of by natural selection, only so"
1228,"far as it profits the individual in its complex struggle for life,"
1228,so the degree of modification in different species will be no uniform
1228,"quantity. If, for instance, a number of species, which stand in direct"
1228,"competition with each other, migrate in a body into a new and afterwards"
1228,"isolated country, they will be little liable to modification; for"
1228,neither migration nor isolation in themselves can do anything. These
1228,principles come into play only by bringing organisms into new relations
1228,"with each other, and in a lesser degree with the surrounding physical"
1228,conditions. As we have seen in the last chapter that some forms have
1228,retained nearly the same character from an enormously remote geological
1228,"period, so certain species have migrated over vast spaces, and have not"
1228,become greatly modified.
1228,
1228,"On these views, it is obvious, that the several species of the same"
1228,"genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world, must"
1228,"originally have proceeded from the same source, as they have descended"
1228,"from the same progenitor. In the case of those species, which have"
1228,"undergone during whole geological periods but little modification, there"
1228,is not much difficulty in believing that they may have migrated from the
1228,same region; for during the vast geographical and climatal changes which
1228,"will have supervened since ancient times, almost any amount of migration"
1228,"is possible. But in many other cases, in which we have reason to believe"
1228,that the species of a genus have been produced within comparatively
1228,"recent times, there is great difficulty on this head. It is also obvious"
1228,"that the individuals of the same species, though now inhabiting distant"
1228,"and isolated regions, must have proceeded from one spot, where their"
1228,"parents were first produced: for, as explained in the last chapter, it"
1228,is incredible that individuals identically the same should ever have
1228,been produced through natural selection from parents specifically
1228,distinct.
1228,
1228,We are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by
1228,"naturalists, namely, whether species have been created at one or more"
1228,points of the earth's surface. Undoubtedly there are very many cases of
1228,"extreme difficulty, in understanding how the same species could possibly"
1228,have migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated
1228,"points, where now found. Nevertheless the simplicity of the view that"
1228,each species was first produced within a single region captivates the
1228,"mind. He who rejects it, rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation"
1228,"with subsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. It is"
1228,"universally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a species"
1228,is continuous; and when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distant
1228,"from each other, or with an interval of such a nature, that the space"
1228,"could not be easily passed over by migration, the fact is given as"
1228,something remarkable and exceptional. The capacity of migrating across
1228,"the sea is more distinctly limited in terrestrial mammals, than perhaps"
1228,"in any other organic beings; and, accordingly, we find no inexplicable"
1228,cases of the same mammal inhabiting distant points of the world. No
1228,geologist will feel any difficulty in such cases as Great Britain having
1228,"been formerly united to Europe, and consequently possessing the same"
1228,quadrupeds. But if the same species can be produced at two separate
1228,"points, why do we not find a single mammal common to Europe and"
1228,Australia or South America? The conditions of life are nearly the
1228,"same, so that a multitude of European animals and plants have become"
1228,naturalised in America and Australia; and some of the aboriginal plants
1228,are identically the same at these distant points of the northern and
1228,"southern hemispheres? The answer, as I believe, is, that mammals have"
1228,"not been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from their varied means"
1228,"of dispersal, have migrated across the vast and broken interspace. The"
1228,great and striking influence which barriers of every kind have had on
1228,"distribution, is intelligible only on the view that the great majority"
1228,"of species have been produced on one side alone, and have not been able"
1228,"to migrate to the other side. Some few families, many sub-families,"
1228,"very many genera, and a still greater number of sections of genera"
1228,are confined to a single region; and it has been observed by several
1228,"naturalists, that the most natural genera, or those genera in which the"
1228,"species are most closely related to each other, are generally local,"
1228,"or confined to one area. What a strange anomaly it would be, if, when"
1228,"coming one step lower in the series, to the individuals of the same"
1228,"species, a directly opposite rule prevailed; and species were not local,"
1228,but had been produced in two or more distinct areas!
1228,
1228,"Hence it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the"
1228,"view of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having"
1228,subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration
1228,"and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most"
1228,"probable. Undoubtedly many cases occur, in which we cannot explain how"
1228,the same species could have passed from one point to the other. But the
1228,"geographical and climatal changes, which have certainly occurred within"
1228,"recent geological times, must have interrupted or rendered discontinuous"
1228,the formerly continuous range of many species. So that we are reduced to
1228,consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous
1228,"and of so grave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered"
1228,"probable by general considerations, that each species has been produced"
1228,"within one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could. It would"
1228,be hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same
1228,"species, now living at distant and separated points; nor do I for a"
1228,moment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases.
1228,"But after some preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most"
1228,"striking classes of facts; namely, the existence of the same species"
1228,"on the summits of distant mountain-ranges, and at distant points in the"
1228,"arctic and antarctic regions; and secondly (in the following chapter),"
1228,"the wide distribution of freshwater productions; and thirdly, the"
1228,occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the
1228,"mainland, though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea. If the"
1228,existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the
1228,"earth's surface, can in many instances be explained on the view of each"
1228,"species having migrated from a single birthplace; then, considering our"
1228,ignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical changes and
1228,"various occasional means of transport, the belief that this has been the"
1228,"universal law, seems to me incomparably the safest."
1228,
1228,"In discussing this subject, we shall be enabled at the same time to"
1228,"consider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several"
1228,"distinct species of a genus, which on my theory have all descended from"
1228,"a common progenitor, can have migrated (undergoing modification"
1228,during some part of their migration) from the area inhabited by their
1228,"progenitor. If it can be shown to be almost invariably the case, that"
1228,"a region, of which most of its inhabitants are closely related to,"
1228,"or belong to the same genera with the species of a second region, has"
1228,probably received at some former period immigrants from this other
1228,"region, my theory will be strengthened; for we can clearly understand,"
1228,"on the principle of modification, why the inhabitants of a region should"
1228,"be related to those of another region, whence it has been stocked. A"
1228,"volcanic island, for instance, upheaved and formed at the distance of a"
1228,"few hundreds of miles from a continent, would probably receive from it"
1228,"in the course of time a few colonists, and their descendants, though"
1228,"modified, would still be plainly related by inheritance to the"
1228,"inhabitants of the continent. Cases of this nature are common, and are,"
1228,"as we shall hereafter more fully see, inexplicable on the theory of"
1228,independent creation. This view of the relation of species in one region
1228,"to those in another, does not differ much (by substituting the word"
1228,variety for species) from that lately advanced in an ingenious paper by
1228,"Mr. Wallace, in which he concludes, that ""every species has come into"
1228,existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing
1228,"closely allied species."" And I now know from correspondence, that this"
1228,coincidence he attributes to generation with modification.
1228,
1228,"The previous remarks on ""single and multiple centres of creation"" do"
1228,"not directly bear on another allied question,--namely whether all the"
1228,"individuals of the same species have descended from a single pair, or"
1228,"single hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many"
1228,individuals simultaneously created. With those organic beings which
1228,"never intercross (if such exist), the species, on my theory, must have"
1228,"descended from a succession of improved varieties, which will never have"
1228,"blended with other individuals or varieties, but will have supplanted"
1228,"each other; so that, at each successive stage of modification and"
1228,"improvement, all the individuals of each variety will have descended"
1228,"from a single parent. But in the majority of cases, namely, with"
1228,"all organisms which habitually unite for each birth, or which often"
1228,"intercross, I believe that during the slow process of modification"
1228,the individuals of the species will have been kept nearly uniform by
1228,intercrossing; so that many individuals will have gone on simultaneously
1228,"changing, and the whole amount of modification will not have been due,"
1228,"at each stage, to descent from a single parent. To illustrate what I"
1228,mean: our English racehorses differ slightly from the horses of every
1228,other breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority to
1228,"descent from any single pair, but to continued care in selecting and"
1228,training many individuals during many generations.
1228,
1228,"Before discussing the three classes of facts, which I have selected as"
1228,"presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of ""single"
1228,"centres of creation,"" I must say a few words on the means of dispersal."
1228,
1228,MEANS OF DISPERSAL.
1228,
1228,Sir C. Lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject. I can
1228,give here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts. Change
1228,of climate must have had a powerful influence on migration: a region
1228,"when its climate was different may have been a high road for migration,"
1228,"but now be impassable; I shall, however, presently have to discuss this"
1228,branch of the subject in some detail. Changes of level in the land must
1228,also have been highly influential: a narrow isthmus now separates two
1228,"marine faunas; submerge it, or let it formerly have been submerged, and"
1228,the two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended: where the
1228,"sea now extends, land may at a former period have connected islands or"
1228,"possibly even continents together, and thus have allowed terrestrial"
1228,productions to pass from one to the other. No geologist will dispute
1228,that great mutations of level have occurred within the period of
1228,existing organisms. Edward Forbes insisted that all the islands in the
1228,"Atlantic must recently have been connected with Europe or Africa, and"
1228,Europe likewise with America. Other authors have thus hypothetically
1228,"bridged over every ocean, and have united almost every island to some"
1228,"mainland. If indeed the arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted,"
1228,it must be admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not
1228,recently been united to some continent. This view cuts the Gordian knot
1228,"of the dispersal of the same species to the most distant points, and"
1228,removes many a difficulty: but to the best of my judgment we are not
1228,authorized in admitting such enormous geographical changes within
1228,the period of existing species. It seems to me that we have abundant
1228,evidence of great oscillations of level in our continents; but not of
1228,"such vast changes in their position and extension, as to have united"
1228,them within the recent period to each other and to the several
1228,intervening oceanic islands. I freely admit the former existence of many
1228,"islands, now buried beneath the sea, which may have served as halting"
1228,places for plants and for many animals during their migration. In the
1228,"coral-producing oceans such sunken islands are now marked, as I believe,"
1228,by rings of coral or atolls standing over them. Whenever it is fully
1228,"admitted, as I believe it will some day be, that each species has"
1228,"proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in the course of time we"
1228,"know something definite about the means of distribution, we shall be"
1228,enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of the land.
1228,But I do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the recent
1228,"period continents which are now quite separate, have been continuously,"
1228,"or almost continuously, united with each other, and with the many"
1228,"existing oceanic islands. Several facts in distribution,--such as the"
1228,great difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost
1228,"every continent,--the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of"
1228,"several lands and even seas to their present inhabitants,--a certain"
1228,degree of relation (as we shall hereafter see) between the distribution
1228,"of mammals and the depth of the sea,--these and other such facts seem to"
1228,me opposed to the admission of such prodigious geographical revolutions
1228,"within the recent period, as are necessitated on the view advanced"
1228,by Forbes and admitted by his many followers. The nature and relative
1228,proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic islands likewise seem to me
1228,opposed to the belief of their former continuity with continents. Nor
1228,does their almost universally volcanic composition favour the admission
1228,that they are the wrecks of sunken continents;--if they had originally
1228,"existed as mountain-ranges on the land, some at least of the islands"
1228,"would have been formed, like other mountain-summits, of granite,"
1228,"metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous or other such rocks, instead of"
1228,consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter.
1228,
1228,"I must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but"
1228,which more properly might be called occasional means of distribution.
1228,"I shall here confine myself to plants. In botanical works, this or"
1228,that plant is stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but for
1228,"transport across the sea, the greater or less facilities may be said to"
1228,"be almost wholly unknown. Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley's aid, a"
1228,"few experiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist the"
1228,injurious action of sea-water. To my surprise I found that out of 
1228,"kinds,  germinated after an immersion of  days, and a few survived"
1228,an immersion of  days. For convenience sake I chiefly tried small
1228,"seeds, without the capsule or fruit; and as all of these sank in a few"
1228,"days, they could not be floated across wide spaces of the sea, whether"
1228,or not they were injured by the salt-water. Afterwards I tried some
1228,"larger fruits, capsules, etc., and some of these floated for a long"
1228,time. It is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of
1228,green and seasoned timber; and it occurred to me that floods might wash
1228,"down plants or branches, and that these might be dried on the banks, and"
1228,then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea. Hence I was
1228,"led to dry stems and branches of  plants with ripe fruit, and to place"
1228,"them on sea water. The majority sank quickly, but some which whilst"
1228,"green floated for a very short time, when dried floated much longer; for"
1228,"instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried, they floated"
1228,for  days and afterwards when planted they germinated; an asparagus
1228,"plant with ripe berries floated for  days, when dried it floated"
1228,"for  days, and the seeds afterwards germinated: the ripe seeds of"
1228,"Helosciadium sank in two days, when dried they floated for above "
1228,"days, and afterwards germinated. Altogether out of the  dried plants,"
1228," floated for above  days, and some of the  floated for a very much"
1228,longer period. So that as / seeds germinated after an immersion
1228,of  days; and as / plants with ripe fruit (but not all the same
1228,"species as in the foregoing experiment) floated, after being dried, for"
1228,"above  days, as far as we may infer anything from these scanty facts,"
1228,we may conclude that the seeds of / plants of any country might be
1228,"floated by sea-currents during  days, and would retain their power"
1228,"of germination. In Johnston's Physical Atlas, the average rate of the"
1228,several Atlantic currents is  miles per diem (some currents running
1228,"at the rate of  miles per diem); on this average, the seeds of /"
1228,plants belonging to one country might be floated across  miles of sea
1228,"to another country; and when stranded, if blown to a favourable spot by"
1228,"an inland gale, they would germinate."
1228,
1228,"Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, but in a"
1228,"much better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea,"
1228,so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really
1228,"floating plants. He tried  seeds, mostly different from mine; but he"
1228,chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live
1228,near the sea; and this would have favoured the average length of
1228,their flotation and of their resistance to the injurious action of the
1228,salt-water. On the other hand he did not previously dry the plants or
1228,"branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have caused"
1228,some of them to have floated much longer. The result was that / of
1228,"his seeds floated for  days, and were then capable of germination. But"
1228,I do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less
1228,time than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments.
1228,Therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about
1228,"/ plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be floated"
1228,"across a space of sea  miles in width, and would then germinate."
1228,"The fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small,"
1228,is interesting; as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be
1228,transported by any other means; and Alph. de Candolle has shown that
1228,such plants generally have restricted ranges.
1228,
1228,But seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. Drift
1228,"timber is thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the"
1228,"widest oceans; and the natives of the coral-islands in the Pacific,"
1228,"procure stones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees,"
1228,"these stones being a valuable royal tax. I find on examination, that"
1228,"when irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees, small"
1228,parcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and
1228,"behind them,--so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in"
1228,the longest transport: out of one small portion of earth thus COMPLETELY
1228,"enclosed by wood in an oak about  years old, three dicotyledonous"
1228,plants germinated: I am certain of the accuracy of this observation.
1228,"Again, I can show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea,"
1228,sometimes escape being immediately devoured; and seeds of many kinds
1228,in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas and
1228,"vetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days' immersion in"
1228,"sea-water; but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had"
1228,"floated on artificial salt-water for  days, to my surprise nearly all"
1228,germinated.
1228,
1228,Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the
1228,transportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how frequently
1228,birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the
1228,ocean. We may I think safely assume that under such circumstances their
1228,rate of flight would often be  miles an hour; and some authors have
1228,given a far higher estimate. I have never seen an instance of nutritious
1228,seeds passing through the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit
1228,will pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey. In
1228,"the course of two months, I picked up in my garden  kinds of seeds,"
1228,"out of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed perfect, and"
1228,"some of them, which I tried, germinated. But the following fact is more"
1228,"important: the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not"
1228,"in the least injure, as I know by trial, the germination of seeds;"
1228,"now after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food, it is"
1228,positively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for
1228, or even  hours. A bird in this interval might easily be blown to
1228,"the distance of  miles, and hawks are known to look out for tired"
1228,"birds, and the contents of their torn crops might thus readily get"
1228,scattered. Mr. Brent informs me that a friend of his had to give up
1228,"flying carrier-pigeons from France to England, as the hawks on the"
1228,English coast destroyed so many on their arrival. Some hawks and owls
1228,"bolt their prey whole, and after an interval of from twelve to twenty"
1228,"hours, disgorge pellets, which, as I know from experiments made in the"
1228,"Zoological Gardens, include seeds capable of germination. Some seeds of"
1228,"the oat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after"
1228,having been from twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different
1228,birds of prey; and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus
1228,"retained for two days and fourteen hours. Freshwater fish, I find, eat"
1228,seeds of many land and water plants: fish are frequently devoured by
1228,"birds, and thus the seeds might be transported from place to place. I"
1228,"forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave"
1228,"their bodies to fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds after"
1228,"an interval of many hours, either rejected the seeds in pellets or"
1228,passed them in their excrement; and several of these seeds retained
1228,"their power of germination. Certain seeds, however, were always killed"
1228,by this process.
1228,
1228,"Although the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean, I can"
1228,show that earth sometimes adheres to them: in one instance I removed
1228,twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a
1228,"partridge, and in this earth there was a pebble quite as large as the"
1228,seed of a vetch. Thus seeds might occasionally be transported to great
1228,distances; for many facts could be given showing that soil almost
1228,everywhere is charged with seeds. Reflect for a moment on the millions
1228,of quails which annually cross the Mediterranean; and can we doubt that
1228,the earth adhering to their feet would sometimes include a few minute
1228,seeds? But I shall presently have to recur to this subject.
1228,
1228,"As icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and"
1228,"have even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, I can"
1228,hardly doubt that they must occasionally have transported seeds from
1228,"one part to another of the arctic and antarctic regions, as suggested by"
1228,Lyell; and during the Glacial period from one part of the now temperate
1228,"regions to another. In the Azores, from the large number of the species"
1228,"of plants common to Europe, in comparison with the plants of other"
1228,"oceanic islands nearer to the mainland, and (as remarked by Mr. H. C."
1228,Watson) from the somewhat northern character of the flora in comparison
1228,"with the latitude, I suspected that these islands had been partly"
1228,"stocked by ice-borne seeds, during the Glacial epoch. At my request Sir"
1228,C. Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to inquire whether he had observed erratic
1228,"boulders on these islands, and he answered that he had found large"
1228,"fragments of granite and other rocks, which do not occur in the"
1228,archipelago. Hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed
1228,"their rocky burthens on the shores of these mid-ocean islands, and it"
1228,is at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds of
1228,northern plants.
1228,
1228,"Considering that the several above means of transport, and that several"
1228,"other means, which without doubt remain to be discovered, have been in"
1228,"action year after year, for centuries and tens of thousands of years,"
1228,it would I think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus
1228,become widely transported. These means of transport are sometimes called
1228,"accidental, but this is not strictly correct: the currents of the sea"
1228,"are not accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind."
1228,It should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry
1228,seeds for very great distances; for seeds do not retain their vitality
1228,when exposed for a great length of time to the action of seawater; nor
1228,could they be long carried in the crops or intestines of birds. These
1228,"means, however, would suffice for occasional transport across tracts of"
1228,"sea some hundred miles in breadth, or from island to island, or from a"
1228,"continent to a neighbouring island, but not from one distant continent"
1228,to another. The floras of distant continents would not by such means
1228,become mingled in any great degree; but would remain as distinct as we
1228,"now see them to be. The currents, from their course, would never bring"
1228,"seeds from North America to Britain, though they might and do bring"
1228,"seeds from the West Indies to our western shores, where, if not killed"
1228,"by so long an immersion in salt-water, they could not endure our"
1228,"climate. Almost every year, one or two land-birds are blown across"
1228,"the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North America to the western shores of"
1228,Ireland and England; but seeds could be transported by these wanderers
1228,"only by one means, namely, in dirt sticking to their feet, which is in"
1228,"itself a rare accident. Even in this case, how small would the chance"
1228,"be of a seed falling on favourable soil, and coming to maturity! But it"
1228,"would be a great error to argue that because a well-stocked island,"
1228,"like Great Britain, has not, as far as is known (and it would be very"
1228,"difficult to prove this), received within the last few centuries,"
1228,"through occasional means of transport, immigrants from Europe or any"
1228,"other continent, that a poorly-stocked island, though standing more"
1228,"remote from the mainland, would not receive colonists by similar means."
1228,I do not doubt that out of twenty seeds or animals transported to an
1228,"island, even if far less well-stocked than Britain, scarcely more than"
1228,"one would be so well fitted to its new home, as to become naturalised."
1228,"But this, as it seems to me, is no valid argument against what would"
1228,"be effected by occasional means of transport, during the long lapse of"
1228,"geological time, whilst an island was being upheaved and formed, and"
1228,before it had become fully stocked with inhabitants. On almost bare
1228,"land, with few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly"
1228,"every seed, which chanced to arrive, would be sure to germinate and"
1228,survive.
1228,
1228,DISPERSAL DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD.
1228,
1228,"The identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits, separated"
1228,"from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where the Alpine"
1228,"species could not possibly exist, is one of the most striking cases"
1228,"known of the same species living at distant points, without the apparent"
1228,possibility of their having migrated from one to the other. It is indeed
1228,a remarkable fact to see so many of the same plants living on the snowy
1228,"regions of the Alps or Pyrenees, and in the extreme northern parts of"
1228,"Europe; but it is far more remarkable, that the plants on the White"
1228,"Mountains, in the United States of America, are all the same with those"
1228,"of Labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa Gray, with"
1228,"those on the loftiest mountains of Europe. Even as long ago as ,"
1228,such facts led Gmelin to conclude that the same species must have been
1228,independently created at several distinct points; and we might have
1228,"remained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others called vivid"
1228,"attention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall immediately see,"
1228,affords a simple explanation of these facts. We have evidence of almost
1228,"every conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that within a very recent"
1228,"geological period, central Europe and North America suffered under an"
1228,Arctic climate. The ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their
1228,"tale more plainly, than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales, with"
1228,"their scored flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of the icy"
1228,streams with which their valleys were lately filled. So greatly has the
1228,"climate of Europe changed, that in Northern Italy, gigantic moraines,"
1228,"left by old glaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize. Throughout"
1228,"a large part of the United States, erratic boulders, and rocks scored by"
1228,"drifted icebergs and coast-ice, plainly reveal a former cold period."
1228,
1228,The former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the
1228,"inhabitants of Europe, as explained with remarkable clearness by Edward"
1228,"Forbes, is substantially as follows. But we shall follow the changes"
1228,"more readily, by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on, and"
1228,"then pass away, as formerly occurred. As the cold came on, and as each"
1228,more southern zone became fitted for arctic beings and ill-fitted for
1228,"their former more temperate inhabitants, the latter would be supplanted"
1228,and arctic productions would take their places. The inhabitants of the
1228,"more temperate regions would at the same time travel southward, unless"
1228,"they were stopped by barriers, in which case they would perish. The"
1228,"mountains would become covered with snow and ice, and their former"
1228,Alpine inhabitants would descend to the plains. By the time that the
1228,"cold had reached its maximum, we should have a uniform arctic fauna and"
1228,"flora, covering the central parts of Europe, as far south as the Alps"
1228,"and Pyrenees, and even stretching into Spain. The now temperate regions"
1228,of the United States would likewise be covered by arctic plants and
1228,"animals, and these would be nearly the same with those of Europe; for"
1228,"the present circumpolar inhabitants, which we suppose to have everywhere"
1228,"travelled southward, are remarkably uniform round the world. We may"
1228,suppose that the Glacial period came on a little earlier or later in
1228,"North America than in Europe, so will the southern migration there have"
1228,been a little earlier or later; but this will make no difference in the
1228,final result.
1228,
1228,"As the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward,"
1228,closely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more
1228,temperate regions. And as the snow melted from the bases of the
1228,"mountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed"
1228,"ground, always ascending higher and higher, as the warmth increased,"
1228,"whilst their brethren were pursuing their northern journey. Hence, when"
1228,"the warmth had fully returned, the same arctic species, which had lately"
1228,"lived in a body together on the lowlands of the Old and New Worlds,"
1228,would be left isolated on distant mountain-summits (having been
1228,exterminated on all lesser heights) and in the arctic regions of both
1228,hemispheres.
1228,
1228,Thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so
1228,immensely remote as on the mountains of the United States and of Europe.
1228,We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine plants of each
1228,mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms living
1228,due north or nearly due north of them: for the migration as the cold
1228,"came on, and the re-migration on the returning warmth, will generally"
1228,"have been due south and north. The Alpine plants, for example, of"
1228,"Scotland, as remarked by Mr. H. C. Watson, and those of the Pyrenees, as"
1228,"remarked by Ramond, are more especially allied to the plants of northern"
1228,Scandinavia; those of the United States to Labrador; those of the
1228,"mountains of Siberia to the arctic regions of that country. These views,"
1228,grounded as they are on the perfectly well-ascertained occurrence of a
1228,"former Glacial period, seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner"
1228,the present distribution of the Alpine and Arctic productions of Europe
1228,"and America, that when in other regions we find the same species on"
1228,"distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude without other evidence,"
1228,that a colder climate permitted their former migration across the low
1228,"intervening tracts, since become too warm for their existence."
1228,
1228,"If the climate, since the Glacial period, has ever been in any degree"
1228,warmer than at present (as some geologists in the United States believe
1228,"to have been the case, chiefly from the distribution of the fossil"
1228,"Gnathodon), then the arctic and temperate productions will at a very"
1228,"late period have marched a little further north, and subsequently have"
1228,retreated to their present homes; but I have met with no satisfactory
1228,"evidence with respect to this intercalated slightly warmer period, since"
1228,the Glacial period.
1228,
1228,"The arctic forms, during their long southern migration and re-migration"
1228,"northward, will have been exposed to nearly the same climate, and, as"
1228,"is especially to be noticed, they will have kept in a body together;"
1228,"consequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed,"
1228,"and, in accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume, they"
1228,will not have been liable to much modification. But with our Alpine
1228,"productions, left isolated from the moment of the returning warmth,"
1228,"first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the"
1228,case will have been somewhat different; for it is not likely that all
1228,the same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges distant
1228,"from each other, and have survived there ever since; they will, also, in"
1228,"all probability have become mingled with ancient Alpine species, which"
1228,must have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the
1228,"Glacial epoch, and which during its coldest period will have been"
1228,"temporarily driven down to the plains; they will, also, have been"
1228,exposed to somewhat different climatal influences. Their mutual
1228,relations will thus have been in some degree disturbed; consequently
1228,they will have been liable to modification; and this we find has been
1228,the case; for if we compare the present Alpine plants and animals of the
1228,"several great European mountain-ranges, though very many of the species"
1228,"are identically the same, some present varieties, some are ranked"
1228,"as doubtful forms, and some few are distinct yet closely allied or"
1228,representative species.
1228,
1228,"In illustrating what, as I believe, actually took place during"
1228,"the Glacial period, I assumed that at its commencement the arctic"
1228,productions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at the
1228,present day. But the foregoing remarks on distribution apply not only
1228,"to strictly arctic forms, but also to many sub-arctic and to some few"
1228,"northern temperate forms, for some of these are the same on the lower"
1228,mountains and on the plains of North America and Europe; and it may be
1228,reasonably asked how I account for the necessary degree of uniformity
1228,"of the sub-arctic and northern temperate forms round the world, at the"
1228,"commencement of the Glacial period. At the present day, the sub-arctic"
1228,and northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds are
1228,separated from each other by the Atlantic Ocean and by the extreme
1228,"northern part of the Pacific. During the Glacial period, when the"
1228,inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than at
1228,"present, they must have been still more completely separated by wider"
1228,spaces of ocean. I believe the above difficulty may be surmounted by
1228,looking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite nature.
1228,"We have good reason to believe that during the newer Pliocene period,"
1228,"before the Glacial epoch, and whilst the majority of the inhabitants of"
1228,"the world were specifically the same as now, the climate was warmer than"
1228,at the present day. Hence we may suppose that the organisms now living
1228,"under the climate of latitude  deg, during the Pliocene period lived"
1228,"further north under the Polar Circle, in latitude  deg- deg; and"
1228,that the strictly arctic productions then lived on the broken land still
1228,"nearer to the pole. Now if we look at a globe, we shall see that under"
1228,"the Polar Circle there is almost continuous land from western Europe,"
1228,"through Siberia, to eastern America. And to this continuity of the"
1228,"circumpolar land, and to the consequent freedom for intermigration"
1228,"under a more favourable climate, I attribute the necessary amount of"
1228,uniformity in the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the
1228,"Old and New Worlds, at a period anterior to the Glacial epoch."
1228,
1228,"Believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have"
1228,"long remained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected"
1228,"to large, but partial oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to"
1228,"extend the above view, and to infer that during some earlier and still"
1228,"warmer period, such as the older Pliocene period, a large number of"
1228,the same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar
1228,"land; and that these plants and animals, both in the Old and New Worlds,"
1228,"began slowly to migrate southwards as the climate became less warm, long"
1228,"before the commencement of the Glacial period. We now see, as I believe,"
1228,"their descendants, mostly in a modified condition, in the central parts"
1228,of Europe and the United States. On this view we can understand the
1228,"relationship, with very little identity, between the productions of"
1228,"North America and Europe,--a relationship which is most remarkable,"
1228,"considering the distance of the two areas, and their separation by the"
1228,Atlantic Ocean. We can further understand the singular fact remarked on
1228,"by several observers, that the productions of Europe and America during"
1228,the later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other
1228,than they are at the present time; for during these warmer periods
1228,the northern parts of the Old and New Worlds will have been almost
1228,"continuously united by land, serving as a bridge, since rendered"
1228,"impassable by cold, for the inter-migration of their inhabitants."
1228,
1228,"During the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon as"
1228,"the species in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds, migrated"
1228,"south of the Polar Circle, they must have been completely cut off from"
1228,"each other. This separation, as far as the more temperate productions"
1228,"are concerned, took place long ages ago. And as the plants and animals"
1228,"migrated southward, they will have become mingled in the one great"
1228,"region with the native American productions, and have had to compete"
1228,"with them; and in the other great region, with those of the Old"
1228,World. Consequently we have here everything favourable for much
1228,"modification,--for far more modification than with the Alpine"
1228,"productions, left isolated, within a much more recent period, on the"
1228,several mountain-ranges and on the arctic lands of the two Worlds. Hence
1228,"it has come, that when we compare the now living productions of the"
1228,"temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find very few identical"
1228,species (though Asa Gray has lately shown that more plants are identical
1228,"than was formerly supposed), but we find in every great class many"
1228,"forms, which some naturalists rank as geographical races, and others as"
1228,distinct species; and a host of closely allied or representative forms
1228,which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct.
1228,
1228,"As on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration"
1228,"of a marine fauna, which during the Pliocene or even a somewhat earlier"
1228,"period, was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the Polar"
1228,"Circle, will account, on the theory of modification, for many closely"
1228,"allied forms now living in areas completely sundered. Thus, I think, we"
1228,can understand the presence of many existing and tertiary representative
1228,forms on the eastern and western shores of temperate North America;
1228,and the still more striking case of many closely allied crustaceans
1228,"(as described in Dana's admirable work), of some fish and other marine"
1228,"animals, in the Mediterranean and in the seas of Japan,--areas now"
1228,separated by a continent and by nearly a hemisphere of equatorial ocean.
1228,
1228,"These cases of relationship, without identity, of the inhabitants of"
1228,"seas now disjoined, and likewise of the past and present inhabitants of"
1228,"the temperate lands of North America and Europe, are inexplicable on the"
1228,"theory of creation. We cannot say that they have been created alike, in"
1228,correspondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas;
1228,"for if we compare, for instance, certain parts of South America with"
1228,"the southern continents of the Old World, we see countries closely"
1228,"corresponding in all their physical conditions, but with their"
1228,inhabitants utterly dissimilar.
1228,
1228,"But we must return to our more immediate subject, the Glacial period."
1228,I am convinced that Forbes's view may be largely extended. In Europe we
1228,"have the plainest evidence of the cold period, from the western shores"
1228,"of Britain to the Oural range, and southward to the Pyrenees. We may"
1228,"infer, from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation,"
1228,"that Siberia was similarly affected. Along the Himalaya, at points "
1228,"miles apart, glaciers have left the marks of their former low descent;"
1228,"and in Sikkim, Dr. Hooker saw maize growing on gigantic ancient"
1228,"moraines. South of the equator, we have some direct evidence of former"
1228,"glacial action in New Zealand; and the same plants, found on widely"
1228,"separated mountains in this island, tell the same story. If one account"
1228,"which has been published can be trusted, we have direct evidence of"
1228,glacial action in the south-eastern corner of Australia.
1228,
1228,"Looking to America; in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of rock"
1228,have been observed on the eastern side as far south as lat.  deg-
1228,"deg, and on the shores of the Pacific, where the climate is now so"
1228,"different, as far south as lat.  deg; erratic boulders have, also,"
1228,been noticed on the Rocky Mountains. In the Cordillera of Equatorial
1228,"South America, glaciers once extended far below their present level."
1228,In central Chile I was astonished at the structure of a vast mound of
1228,"detritus, about  feet in height, crossing a valley of the Andes; and"
1228,"this I now feel convinced was a gigantic moraine, left far below any"
1228,"existing glacier. Further south on both sides of the continent, from"
1228,"lat.  deg to the southernmost extremity, we have the clearest evidence"
1228,"of former glacial action, in huge boulders transported far from their"
1228,parent source.
1228,
1228,We do not know that the Glacial epoch was strictly simultaneous at these
1228,several far distant points on opposite sides of the world. But we have
1228,"good evidence in almost every case, that the epoch was included within"
1228,"the latest geological period. We have, also, excellent evidence, that it"
1228,"endured for an enormous time, as measured by years, at each point. The"
1228,"cold may have come on, or have ceased, earlier at one point of the globe"
1228,"than at another, but seeing that it endured for long at each, and that"
1228,"it was contemporaneous in a geological sense, it seems to me probable"
1228,"that it was, during a part at least of the period, actually simultaneous"
1228,"throughout the world. Without some distinct evidence to the contrary, we"
1228,may at least admit as probable that the glacial action was simultaneous
1228,"on the eastern and western sides of North America, in the Cordillera"
1228,"under the equator and under the warmer temperate zones, and on both"
1228,"sides of the southern extremity of the continent. If this be admitted,"
1228,it is difficult to avoid believing that the temperature of the whole
1228,world was at this period simultaneously cooler. But it would suffice for
1228,"my purpose, if the temperature was at the same time lower along certain"
1228,broad belts of longitude.
1228,
1228,"On this view of the whole world, or at least of broad longitudinal"
1228,"belts, having been simultaneously colder from pole to pole, much light"
1228,can be thrown on the present distribution of identical and allied
1228,"species. In America, Dr. Hooker has shown that between forty and fifty"
1228,"of the flowering plants of Tierra del Fuego, forming no inconsiderable"
1228,"part of its scanty flora, are common to Europe, enormously remote as"
1228,these two points are; and there are many closely allied species. On
1228,the lofty mountains of equatorial America a host of peculiar species
1228,"belonging to European genera occur. On the highest mountains of Brazil,"
1228,"some few European genera were found by Gardner, which do not exist in"
1228,the wide intervening hot countries. So on the Silla of Caraccas
1228,the illustrious Humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera
1228,"characteristic of the Cordillera. On the mountains of Abyssinia, several"
1228,European forms and some few representatives of the peculiar flora of the
1228,Cape of Good Hope occur. At the Cape of Good Hope a very few European
1228,"species, believed not to have been introduced by man, and on the"
1228,"mountains, some few representative European forms are found, which"
1228,have not been discovered in the intertropical parts of Africa. On the
1228,"Himalaya, and on the isolated mountain-ranges of the peninsula of India,"
1228,"on the heights of Ceylon, and on the volcanic cones of Java, many plants"
1228,"occur, either identically the same or representing each other, and"
1228,"at the same time representing plants of Europe, not found in the"
1228,intervening hot lowlands. A list of the genera collected on the loftier
1228,peaks of Java raises a picture of a collection made on a hill in Europe!
1228,Still more striking is the fact that southern Australian forms are
1228,clearly represented by plants growing on the summits of the mountains
1228,"of Borneo. Some of these Australian forms, as I hear from Dr. Hooker,"
1228,"extend along the heights of the peninsula of Malacca, and are thinly"
1228,"scattered, on the one hand over India and on the other as far north as"
1228,Japan.
1228,
1228,"On the southern mountains of Australia, Dr. F. Muller has discovered"
1228,"several European species; other species, not introduced by man, occur"
1228,"on the lowlands; and a long list can be given, as I am informed by"
1228,"Dr. Hooker, of European genera, found in Australia, but not in the"
1228,intermediate torrid regions. In the admirable 'Introduction to the Flora
1228,"of New Zealand,' by Dr. Hooker, analogous and striking facts are"
1228,given in regard to the plants of that large island. Hence we see that
1228,"throughout the world, the plants growing on the more lofty mountains,"
1228,"and on the temperate lowlands of the northern and southern hemispheres,"
1228,are sometimes identically the same; but they are much oftener
1228,"specifically distinct, though related to each other in a most remarkable"
1228,manner.
1228,
1228,This brief abstract applies to plants alone: some strictly analogous
1228,facts could be given on the distribution of terrestrial animals. In
1228,"marine productions, similar cases occur; as an example, I may quote a"
1228,"remark by the highest authority, Professor Dana, that ""it is certainly a"
1228,wonderful fact that New Zealand should have a closer resemblance in its
1228,"crustacea to Great Britain, its antipode, than to any other part of"
1228,"the world."" Sir J. Richardson, also, speaks of the reappearance on the"
1228,"shores of New Zealand, Tasmania, etc., of northern forms of fish. Dr."
1228,Hooker informs me that twenty-five species of Algae are common to New
1228,"Zealand and to Europe, but have not been found in the intermediate"
1228,tropical seas.
1228,
1228,It should be observed that the northern species and forms found in the
1228,"southern parts of the southern hemisphere, and on the mountain-ranges"
1228,"of the intertropical regions, are not arctic, but belong to the northern"
1228,"temperate zones. As Mr. H. C. Watson has recently remarked, ""In receding"
1228,"from polar towards equatorial latitudes, the Alpine or mountain floras"
1228,"really become less and less arctic."" Many of the forms living on"
1228,the mountains of the warmer regions of the earth and in the southern
1228,"hemisphere are of doubtful value, being ranked by some naturalists as"
1228,"specifically distinct, by others as varieties; but some are certainly"
1228,"identical, and many, though closely related to northern forms, must be"
1228,ranked as distinct species.
1228,
1228,"Now let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts, on the"
1228,"belief, supported as it is by a large body of geological evidence, that"
1228,"the whole world, or a large part of it, was during the Glacial period"
1228,"simultaneously much colder than at present. The Glacial period, as"
1228,"measured by years, must have been very long; and when we remember over"
1228,what vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within
1228,"a few centuries, this period will have been ample for any amount of"
1228,"migration. As the cold came slowly on, all the tropical plants and other"
1228,"productions will have retreated from both sides towards the equator,"
1228,"followed in the rear by the temperate productions, and these by the"
1228,arctic; but with the latter we are not now concerned. The tropical
1228,plants probably suffered much extinction; how much no one can say;
1228,perhaps formerly the tropics supported as many species as we see at the
1228,"present day crowded together at the Cape of Good Hope, and in parts of"
1228,temperate Australia. As we know that many tropical plants and animals
1228,"can withstand a considerable amount of cold, many might have escaped"
1228,"extermination during a moderate fall of temperature, more especially by"
1228,"escaping into the warmest spots. But the great fact to bear in mind is,"
1228,that all tropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent. On
1228,"the other hand, the temperate productions, after migrating nearer to"
1228,"the equator, though they will have been placed under somewhat new"
1228,"conditions, will have suffered less. And it is certain that many"
1228,"temperate plants, if protected from the inroads of competitors, can"
1228,"withstand a much warmer climate than their own. Hence, it seems to"
1228,"me possible, bearing in mind that the tropical productions were in"
1228,a suffering state and could not have presented a firm front against
1228,"intruders, that a certain number of the more vigorous and dominant"
1228,temperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and have reached
1228,"or even crossed the equator. The invasion would, of course, have been"
1228,"greatly favoured by high land, and perhaps by a dry climate; for Dr."
1228,Falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of the tropics
1228,which is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate climate. On
1228,"the other hand, the most humid and hottest districts will have afforded"
1228,an asylum to the tropical natives. The mountain-ranges north-west of the
1228,"Himalaya, and the long line of the Cordillera, seem to have afforded two"
1228,"great lines of invasion: and it is a striking fact, lately communicated"
1228,"to me by Dr. Hooker, that all the flowering plants, about forty-six in"
1228,"number, common to Tierra del Fuego and to Europe still exist in North"
1228,"America, which must have lain on the line of march. But I do not doubt"
1228,that some temperate productions entered and crossed even the LOWLANDS of
1228,"the tropics at the period when the cold was most intense,--when arctic"
1228,forms had migrated some twenty-five degrees of latitude from their
1228,native country and covered the land at the foot of the Pyrenees. At this
1228,"period of extreme cold, I believe that the climate under the equator at"
1228,the level of the sea was about the same with that now felt there at the
1228,"height of six or seven thousand feet. During this the coldest period, I"
1228,suppose that large spaces of the tropical lowlands were clothed with a
1228,"mingled tropical and temperate vegetation, like that now growing with"
1228,"strange luxuriance at the base of the Himalaya, as graphically described"
1228,by Hooker.
1228,
1228,"Thus, as I believe, a considerable number of plants, a few terrestrial"
1228,"animals, and some marine productions, migrated during the Glacial period"
1228,from the northern and southern temperate zones into the intertropical
1228,"regions, and some even crossed the equator. As the warmth returned,"
1228,"these temperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains, being"
1228,"exterminated on the lowlands; those which had not reached the equator,"
1228,would re-migrate northward or southward towards their former homes; but
1228,"the forms, chiefly northern, which had crossed the equator, would travel"
1228,still further from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the
1228,opposite hemisphere. Although we have reason to believe from geological
1228,evidence that the whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely any
1228,modification during their long southern migration and re-migration
1228,"northward, the case may have been wholly different with those intruding"
1228,"forms which settled themselves on the intertropical mountains, and in"
1228,the southern hemisphere. These being surrounded by strangers will have
1228,had to compete with many new forms of life; and it is probable that
1228,"selected modifications in their structure, habits, and constitutions"
1228,"will have profited them. Thus many of these wanderers, though still"
1228,plainly related by inheritance to their brethren of the northern or
1228,"southern hemispheres, now exist in their new homes as well-marked"
1228,varieties or as distinct species.
1228,
1228,"It is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard to"
1228,"America, and by Alph. de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many"
1228,more identical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the
1228,"north to the south, than in a reversed direction. We see, however, a"
1228,few southern vegetable forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia.
1228,I suspect that this preponderant migration from north to south is due
1228,"to the greater extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms"
1228,"having existed in their own homes in greater numbers, and having"
1228,consequently been advanced through natural selection and competition
1228,"to a higher stage of perfection or dominating power, than the southern"
1228,"forms. And thus, when they became commingled during the Glacial period,"
1228,the northern forms were enabled to beat the less powerful southern
1228,"forms. Just in the same manner as we see at the present day, that very"
1228,"many European productions cover the ground in La Plata, and in a lesser"
1228,"degree in Australia, and have to a certain extent beaten the natives;"
1228,whereas extremely few southern forms have become naturalised in any part
1228,"of Europe, though hides, wool, and other objects likely to carry seeds"
1228,have been largely imported into Europe during the last two or three
1228,"centuries from La Plata, and during the last thirty or forty years"
1228,from Australia. Something of the same kind must have occurred on the
1228,intertropical mountains: no doubt before the Glacial period they were
1228,stocked with endemic Alpine forms; but these have almost everywhere
1228,"largely yielded to the more dominant forms, generated in the larger"
1228,areas and more efficient workshops of the north. In many islands the
1228,native productions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by the
1228,"naturalised; and if the natives have not been actually exterminated,"
1228,"their numbers have been greatly reduced, and this is the first stage"
1228,towards extinction. A mountain is an island on the land; and the
1228,intertropical mountains before the Glacial period must have been
1228,completely isolated; and I believe that the productions of these islands
1228,on the land yielded to those produced within the larger areas of the
1228,"north, just in the same way as the productions of real islands have"
1228,"everywhere lately yielded to continental forms, naturalised by man's"
1228,agency.
1228,
1228,I am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the view
1228,here given in regard to the range and affinities of the allied species
1228,which live in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the
1228,mountains of the intertropical regions. Very many difficulties remain
1228,to be solved. I do not pretend to indicate the exact lines and means
1228,"of migration, or the reason why certain species and not others have"
1228,migrated; why certain species have been modified and have given rise to
1228,"new groups of forms, and others have remained unaltered. We cannot hope"
1228,"to explain such facts, until we can say why one species and not another"
1228,becomes naturalised by man's agency in a foreign land; why one ranges
1228,"twice or thrice as far, and is twice or thrice as common, as another"
1228,species within their own homes.
1228,
1228,I have said that many difficulties remain to be solved: some of the
1228,most remarkable are stated with admirable clearness by Dr. Hooker in
1228,his botanical works on the antarctic regions. These cannot be here
1228,discussed. I will only say that as far as regards the occurrence of
1228,"identical species at points so enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New"
1228,"Zealand, and Fuegia, I believe that towards the close of the Glacial"
1228,"period, icebergs, as suggested by Lyell, have been largely concerned in"
1228,"their dispersal. But the existence of several quite distinct species,"
1228,"belonging to genera exclusively confined to the south, at these and"
1228,"other distant points of the southern hemisphere, is, on my theory of"
1228,"descent with modification, a far more remarkable case of difficulty. For"
1228,"some of these species are so distinct, that we cannot suppose that there"
1228,has been time since the commencement of the Glacial period for their
1228,"migration, and for their subsequent modification to the necessary"
1228,degree. The facts seem to me to indicate that peculiar and very distinct
1228,species have migrated in radiating lines from some common centre; and I
1228,"am inclined to look in the southern, as in the northern hemisphere, to a"
1228,"former and warmer period, before the commencement of the Glacial period,"
1228,"when the antarctic lands, now covered with ice, supported a highly"
1228,peculiar and isolated flora. I suspect that before this flora was
1228,"exterminated by the Glacial epoch, a few forms were widely dispersed"
1228,to various points of the southern hemisphere by occasional means of
1228,"transport, and by the aid, as halting-places, of existing and now sunken"
1228,"islands, and perhaps at the commencement of the Glacial period, by"
1228,"icebergs. By these means, as I believe, the southern shores of America,"
1228,"Australia, New Zealand have become slightly tinted by the same peculiar"
1228,forms of vegetable life.
1228,
1228,"Sir C. Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language almost"
1228,"identical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of climate on"
1228,geographical distribution. I believe that the world has recently felt
1228,"one of his great cycles of change; and that on this view, combined with"
1228,"modification through natural selection, a multitude of facts in the"
1228,present distribution both of the same and of allied forms of life can be
1228,explained. The living waters may be said to have flowed during one short
1228,"period from the north and from the south, and to have crossed at the"
1228,equator; but to have flowed with greater force from the north so as
1228,to have freely inundated the south. As the tide leaves its drift in
1228,"horizontal lines, though rising higher on the shores where the tide"
1228,"rises highest, so have the living waters left their living drift on our"
1228,"mountain-summits, in a line gently rising from the arctic lowlands to"
1228,a great height under the equator. The various beings thus left stranded
1228,"may be compared with savage races of man, driven up and surviving in the"
1228,"mountain-fastnesses of almost every land, which serve as a record,"
1228,"full of interest to us, of the former inhabitants of the surrounding"
1228,lowlands.

1228,Summary of the last and present chapters.
1228,
1228,As lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers of
1228,"land, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would not"
1228,"have ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is apparently"
1228,"a still more impassable barrier, that they never would have extended to"
1228,distant countries. But the case is exactly the reverse. Not only have
1228,"many fresh-water species, belonging to quite different classes, an"
1228,"enormous range, but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner"
1228,"throughout the world. I well remember, when first collecting in the"
1228,"fresh waters of Brazil, feeling much surprise at the similarity of"
1228,"the fresh-water insects, shells, etc., and at the dissimilarity of the"
1228,"surrounding terrestrial beings, compared with those of Britain."
1228,
1228,"But this power in fresh-water productions of ranging widely, though so"
1228,"unexpected, can, I think, in most cases be explained by their having"
1228,"become fitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent"
1228,"migrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream; and liability"
1228,to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary
1228,"consequence. We can here consider only a few cases. In regard to fish, I"
1228,believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant
1228,continents. But on the same continent the species often range widely and
1228,almost capriciously; for two river-systems will have some fish in common
1228,and some different. A few facts seem to favour the possibility of their
1228,occasional transport by accidental means; like that of the live fish
1228,"not rarely dropped by whirlwinds in India, and the vitality of their"
1228,ova when removed from the water. But I am inclined to attribute the
1228,dispersal of fresh-water fish mainly to slight changes within the recent
1228,"period in the level of the land, having caused rivers to flow into each"
1228,"other. Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during"
1228,"floods, without any change of level. We have evidence in the loess of"
1228,the Rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a very
1228,"recent geological period, and when the surface was peopled by existing"
1228,land and fresh-water shells. The wide difference of the fish on opposite
1228,"sides of continuous mountain-ranges, which from an early period must"
1228,"have parted river-systems and completely prevented their inosculation,"
1228,seems to lead to this same conclusion. With respect to allied
1228,"fresh-water fish occurring at very distant points of the world, no doubt"
1228,there are many cases which cannot at present be explained: but some
1228,"fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases"
1228,"there will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and"
1228,"consequently time and means for much migration. In the second place,"
1228,salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh
1228,"water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of"
1228,"fishes confined exclusively to fresh water, so that we may imagine that"
1228,a marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores
1228,"of the sea, and subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh"
1228,waters of a distant land.
1228,
1228,"Some species of fresh-water shells have a very wide range, and allied"
1228,"species, which, on my theory, are descended from a common parent and"
1228,"must have proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world."
1228,"Their distribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not"
1228,"likely to be transported by birds, and they are immediately killed"
1228,"by sea water, as are the adults. I could not even understand how some"
1228,naturalised species have rapidly spread throughout the same country. But
1228,"two facts, which I have observed--and no doubt many others remain to be"
1228,observed--throw some light on this subject. When a duck suddenly emerges
1228,"from a pond covered with duck-weed, I have twice seen these little"
1228,"plants adhering to its back; and it has happened to me, in removing"
1228,"a little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that I have quite"
1228,unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the other.
1228,"But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended a duck's feet,"
1228,"which might represent those of a bird sleeping in a natural pond, in"
1228,"an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching; and"
1228,I found that numbers of the extremely minute and just hatched shells
1228,"crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out"
1228,"of the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more"
1228,advanced age they would voluntarily drop off. These just hatched
1228,"molluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet,"
1228,"in damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time a"
1228,"duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and would"
1228,"be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet, if blown across sea to an"
1228,oceanic island or to any other distant point. Sir Charles Lyell also
1228,informs me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus (a fresh-water
1228,shell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a water-beetle of
1228,"the same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board the 'Beagle,' when"
1228,forty-five miles distant from the nearest land: how much farther it
1228,might have flown with a favouring gale no one can tell.
1228,
1228,"With respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many"
1228,"fresh-water and even marsh-species have, both over continents and to the"
1228,"most remote oceanic islands. This is strikingly shown, as remarked by"
1228,"Alph. de Candolle, in large groups of terrestrial plants, which have"
1228,only a very few aquatic members; for these latter seem immediately to
1228,"acquire, as if in consequence, a very wide range. I think favourable"
1228,means of dispersal explain this fact. I have before mentioned that earth
1228,"occasionally, though rarely, adheres in some quantity to the feet and"
1228,"beaks of birds. Wading birds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds,"
1228,"if suddenly flushed, would be the most likely to have muddy feet."
1228,"Birds of this order I can show are the greatest wanderers, and are"
1228,occasionally found on the most remote and barren islands in the open
1228,"ocean; they would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea, so"
1228,"that the dirt would not be washed off their feet; when making land,"
1228,they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water haunts. I do not
1228,believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with
1228,"seeds: I have tried several little experiments, but will here give only"
1228,the most striking case: I took in February three table-spoonfuls of
1228,"mud from three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little"
1228,pond; this mud when dry weighed only  / ounces; I kept it covered
1228,"up in my study for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it"
1228,"grew; the plants were of many kinds, and were altogether  in number;"
1228,and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! Considering
1228,"these facts, I think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if"
1228,water-birds did not transport the seeds of fresh-water plants to vast
1228,"distances, and if consequently the range of these plants was not very"
1228,great. The same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some of
1228,the smaller fresh-water animals.
1228,
1228,Other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. I have
1228,"stated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they reject"
1228,many other kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish swallow
1228,"seeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and Potamogeton."
1228,"Herons and other birds, century after century, have gone on daily"
1228,"devouring fish; they then take flight and go to other waters, or are"
1228,blown across the sea; and we have seen that seeds retain their power
1228,"of germination, when rejected in pellets or in excrement, many hours"
1228,afterwards. When I saw the great size of the seeds of that fine
1228,"water-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph. de Candolle's remarks"
1228,"on this plant, I thought that its distribution must remain quite"
1228,inexplicable; but Audubon states that he found the seeds of the great
1228,"southern water-lily (probably, according to Dr. Hooker, the Nelumbium"
1228,"luteum) in a heron's stomach; although I do not know the fact, yet"
1228,analogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and getting
1228,"a hearty meal of fish, would probably reject from its stomach a pellet"
1228,containing the seeds of the Nelumbium undigested; or the seeds might be
1228,"dropped by the bird whilst feeding its young, in the same way as fish"
1228,are known sometimes to be dropped.
1228,
1228,"In considering these several means of distribution, it should be"
1228,"remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance,"
1228,"on a rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg"
1228,will have a good chance of succeeding. Although there will always be a
1228,"struggle for life between the individuals of the species, however"
1228,"few, already occupying any pond, yet as the number of kinds is small,"
1228,"compared with those on the land, the competition will probably be less"
1228,severe between aquatic than between terrestrial species; consequently
1228,"an intruder from the waters of a foreign country, would have a better"
1228,"chance of seizing on a place, than in the case of terrestrial colonists."
1228,"We should, also, remember that some, perhaps many, fresh-water"
1228,"productions are low in the scale of nature, and that we have reason to"
1228,believe that such low beings change or become modified less quickly
1228,than the high; and this will give longer time than the average for
1228,the migration of the same aquatic species. We should not forget the
1228,probability of many species having formerly ranged as continuously as
1228,"fresh-water productions ever can range, over immense areas, and having"
1228,subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions. But the wide
1228,"distribution of fresh-water plants and of the lower animals, whether"
1228,"retaining the same identical form or in some degree modified, I believe"
1228,"mainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals,"
1228,"more especially by fresh-water birds, which have large powers of flight,"
1228,and naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of
1228,"water. Nature, like a careful gardener, thus takes her seeds from a bed"
1228,"of a particular nature, and drops them in another equally well fitted"
1228,for them.
1228,
1228,ON THE INHABITANTS OF OCEANIC ISLANDS.
1228,
1228,"We now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which I have"
1228,"selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty, on the view"
1228,that all the individuals both of the same and of allied species have
1228,descended from a single parent; and therefore have all proceeded from a
1228,"common birthplace, notwithstanding that in the course of time they have"
1228,come to inhabit distant points of the globe. I have already stated that
1228,"I cannot honestly admit Forbes's view on continental extensions, which,"
1228,"if legitimately followed out, would lead to the belief that within the"
1228,recent period all existing islands have been nearly or quite joined to
1228,"some continent. This view would remove many difficulties, but it would"
1228,"not, I think, explain all the facts in regard to insular productions. In"
1228,the following remarks I shall not confine myself to the mere question of
1228,"dispersal; but shall consider some other facts, which bear on the"
1228,truth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent with
1228,modification.
1228,
1228,The species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number
1228,compared with those on equal continental areas: Alph. de Candolle admits
1228,"this for plants, and Wollaston for insects. If we look to the large"
1228,"size and varied stations of New Zealand, extending over  miles of"
1228,"latitude, and compare its flowering plants, only  in number, with"
1228,"those on an equal area at the Cape of Good Hope or in Australia,"
1228,"we must, I think, admit that something quite independently of any"
1228,difference in physical conditions has caused so great a difference in
1228,"number. Even the uniform county of Cambridge has  plants, and the"
1228,"little island of Anglesea , but a few ferns and a few introduced"
1228,"plants are included in these numbers, and the comparison in some other"
1228,respects is not quite fair. We have evidence that the barren island of
1228,Ascension aboriginally possessed under half-a-dozen flowering plants;
1228,"yet many have become naturalised on it, as they have on New Zealand and"
1228,on every other oceanic island which can be named. In St. Helena there is
1228,reason to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or
1228,quite exterminated many native productions. He who admits the doctrine
1228,"of the creation of each separate species, will have to admit, that a"
1228,sufficient number of the best adapted plants and animals have not been
1228,created on oceanic islands; for man has unintentionally stocked them
1228,from various sources far more fully and perfectly than has nature.
1228,
1228,Although in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants is
1228,"scanty, the proportion of endemic species (i.e. those found nowhere else"
1228,"in the world) is often extremely large. If we compare, for instance, the"
1228,"number of the endemic land-shells in Madeira, or of the endemic birds in"
1228,"the Galapagos Archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and"
1228,"then compare the area of the islands with that of the continent, we"
1228,shall see that this is true. This fact might have been expected on my
1228,"theory, for, as already explained, species occasionally arriving after"
1228,"long intervals in a new and isolated district, and having to compete"
1228,"with new associates, will be eminently liable to modification, and"
1228,will often produce groups of modified descendants. But it by no means
1228,"follows, that, because in an island nearly all the species of one class"
1228,"are peculiar, those of another class, or of another section of the same"
1228,"class, are peculiar; and this difference seems to depend on the species"
1228,which do not become modified having immigrated with facility and in a
1228,"body, so that their mutual relations have not been much disturbed. Thus"
1228,"in the Galapagos Islands nearly every land-bird, but only two out of the"
1228,"eleven marine birds, are peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds"
1228,"could arrive at these islands more easily than land-birds. Bermuda, on"
1228,"the other hand, which lies at about the same distance from North America"
1228,"as the Galapagos Islands do from South America, and which has a very"
1228,"peculiar soil, does not possess one endemic land bird; and we know from"
1228,"Mr. J. M. Jones's admirable account of Bermuda, that very many North"
1228,"American birds, during their great annual migrations, visit either"
1228,periodically or occasionally this island. Madeira does not possess one
1228,"peculiar bird, and many European and African birds are almost every year"
1228,"blown there, as I am informed by Mr. E. V. Harcourt. So that these two"
1228,"islands of Bermuda and Madeira have been stocked by birds, which for"
1228,"long ages have struggled together in their former homes, and have become"
1228,"mutually adapted to each other; and when settled in their new homes,"
1228,each kind will have been kept by the others to their proper places and
1228,"habits, and will consequently have been little liable to modification."
1228,"Madeira, again, is inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiar"
1228,"land-shells, whereas not one species of sea-shell is confined to its"
1228,"shores: now, though we do not know how seashells are dispersed, yet"
1228,"we can see that their eggs or larvae, perhaps attached to seaweed or"
1228,"floating timber, or to the feet of wading-birds, might be transported"
1228,"far more easily than land-shells, across three or four hundred miles of"
1228,open sea. The different orders of insects in Madeira apparently present
1228,analogous facts.
1228,
1228,"Oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes, and"
1228,their places are apparently occupied by the other inhabitants; in the
1228,"Galapagos Islands reptiles, and in New Zealand gigantic wingless birds,"
1228,"take the place of mammals. In the plants of the Galapagos Islands, Dr."
1228,Hooker has shown that the proportional numbers of the different
1228,orders are very different from what they are elsewhere. Such cases are
1228,generally accounted for by the physical conditions of the islands;
1228,but this explanation seems to me not a little doubtful. Facility of
1228,"immigration, I believe, has been at least as important as the nature of"
1228,the conditions.
1228,
1228,Many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the
1228,"inhabitants of remote islands. For instance, in certain islands not"
1228,"tenanted by mammals, some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked"
1228,seeds; yet few relations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked
1228,seeds for transportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds. This
1228,"case presents no difficulty on my view, for a hooked seed might be"
1228,transported to an island by some other means; and the plant then
1228,"becoming slightly modified, but still retaining its hooked seeds,"
1228,"would form an endemic species, having as useless an appendage as any"
1228,"rudimentary organ,--for instance, as the shrivelled wings under the"
1228,"soldered elytra of many insular beetles. Again, islands often possess"
1228,trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include only
1228,"herbaceous species; now trees, as Alph. de Candolle has shown, generally"
1228,"have, whatever the cause may be, confined ranges. Hence trees would be"
1228,"little likely to reach distant oceanic islands; and an herbaceous plant,"
1228,though it would have no chance of successfully competing in stature
1228,"with a fully developed tree, when established on an island and having to"
1228,"compete with herbaceous plants alone, might readily gain an advantage"
1228,"by growing taller and taller and overtopping the other plants. If so,"
1228,natural selection would often tend to add to the stature of herbaceous
1228,"plants when growing on an island, to whatever order they belonged, and"
1228,thus convert them first into bushes and ultimately into trees.
1228,
1228,"With respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands, Bory St."
1228,"Vincent long ago remarked that Batrachians (frogs, toads, newts) have"
1228,never been found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans
1228,"are studded. I have taken pains to verify this assertion, and I have"
1228,"found it strictly true. I have, however, been assured that a frog exists"
1228,on the mountains of the great island of New Zealand; but I suspect that
1228,this exception (if the information be correct) may be explained through
1228,"glacial agency. This general absence of frogs, toads, and newts on"
1228,so many oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their physical
1228,conditions; indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly well fitted for
1228,"these animals; for frogs have been introduced into Madeira, the Azores,"
1228,"and Mauritius, and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance. But as"
1228,these animals and their spawn are known to be immediately killed by
1228,"sea-water, on my view we can see that there would be great difficulty in"
1228,"their transportal across the sea, and therefore why they do not exist on"
1228,"any oceanic island. But why, on the theory of creation, they should not"
1228,"have been created there, it would be very difficult to explain."
1228,
1228,Mammals offer another and similar case. I have carefully searched the
1228,"oldest voyages, but have not finished my search; as yet I have not found"
1228,"a single instance, free from doubt, of a terrestrial mammal (excluding"
1228,domesticated animals kept by the natives) inhabiting an island situated
1228,above  miles from a continent or great continental island; and
1228,many islands situated at a much less distance are equally barren. The
1228,"Falkland Islands, which are inhabited by a wolf-like fox, come nearest"
1228,"to an exception; but this group cannot be considered as oceanic, as it"
1228,"lies on a bank connected with the mainland; moreover, icebergs formerly"
1228,"brought boulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly"
1228,"transported foxes, as so frequently now happens in the arctic regions."
1228,"Yet it cannot be said that small islands will not support small mammals,"
1228,"for they occur in many parts of the world on very small islands, if"
1228,close to a continent; and hardly an island can be named on which our
1228,smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and greatly multiplied.
1228,"It cannot be said, on the ordinary view of creation, that there has"
1228,not been time for the creation of mammals; many volcanic islands are
1228,"sufficiently ancient, as shown by the stupendous degradation which they"
1228,have suffered and by their tertiary strata: there has also been time
1228,for the production of endemic species belonging to other classes; and on
1228,continents it is thought that mammals appear and disappear at a quicker
1228,rate than other and lower animals. Though terrestrial mammals do not
1228,"occur on oceanic islands, aerial mammals do occur on almost every"
1228,island. New Zealand possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world:
1228,"Norfolk Island, the Viti Archipelago, the Bonin Islands, the Caroline"
1228,"and Marianne Archipelagoes, and Mauritius, all possess their peculiar"
1228,"bats. Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced"
1228,bats and no other mammals on remote islands? On my view this question
1228,can easily be answered; for no terrestrial mammal can be transported
1228,"across a wide space of sea, but bats can fly across. Bats have been seen"
1228,wandering by day far over the Atlantic Ocean; and two North American
1228,"species either regularly or occasionally visit Bermuda, at the distance"
1228,"of  miles from the mainland. I hear from Mr. Tomes, who has specially"
1228,"studied this family, that many of the same species have enormous ranges,"
1228,and are found on continents and on far distant islands. Hence we have
1228,only to suppose that such wandering species have been modified through
1228,"natural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position,"
1228,"and we can understand the presence of endemic bats on islands, with the"
1228,absence of all terrestrial mammals.
1228,
1228,Besides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the remoteness
1228,"of islands from continents, there is also a relation, to a certain"
1228,"extent independent of distance, between the depth of the sea separating"
1228,"an island from the neighbouring mainland, and the presence in both of"
1228,the same mammiferous species or of allied species in a more or less
1228,modified condition. Mr. Windsor Earl has made some striking observations
1228,"on this head in regard to the great Malay Archipelago, which is"
1228,traversed near Celebes by a space of deep ocean; and this space
1228,separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas. On either side the
1228,"islands are situated on moderately deep submarine banks, and they are"
1228,inhabited by closely allied or identical quadrupeds. No doubt some few
1228,"anomalies occur in this great archipelago, and there is much difficulty"
1228,in forming a judgment in some cases owing to the probable naturalisation
1228,of certain mammals through man's agency; but we shall soon have much
1228,light thrown on the natural history of this archipelago by the admirable
1228,zeal and researches of Mr. Wallace. I have not as yet had time to follow
1228,up this subject in all other quarters of the world; but as far as I have
1228,"gone, the relation generally holds good. We see Britain separated by a"
1228,"shallow channel from Europe, and the mammals are the same on both"
1228,sides; we meet with analogous facts on many islands separated by similar
1228,channels from Australia. The West Indian Islands stand on a deeply
1228,"submerged bank, nearly  fathoms in depth, and here we find American"
1228,"forms, but the species and even the genera are distinct. As the amount"
1228,of modification in all cases depends to a certain degree on the lapse
1228,"of time, and as during changes of level it is obvious that islands"
1228,separated by shallow channels are more likely to have been continuously
1228,united within a recent period to the mainland than islands separated
1228,"by deeper channels, we can understand the frequent relation between the"
1228,depth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian inhabitants
1228,"of islands with those of a neighbouring continent,--an inexplicable"
1228,relation on the view of independent acts of creation.
1228,
1228,All the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanic
1228,"islands,--namely, the scarcity of kinds--the richness in endemic forms"
1228,"in particular classes or sections of classes,--the absence of whole"
1228,"groups, as of batrachians, and of terrestrial mammals notwithstanding"
1228,"the presence of aerial bats,--the singular proportions of certain"
1228,"orders of plants,--herbaceous forms having been developed into trees,"
1228,"etc.,--seem to me to accord better with the view of occasional means of"
1228,"transport having been largely efficient in the long course of time, than"
1228,with the view of all our oceanic islands having been formerly connected
1228,by continuous land with the nearest continent; for on this latter
1228,view the migration would probably have been more complete; and if
1228,"modification be admitted, all the forms of life would have been more"
1228,"equally modified, in accordance with the paramount importance of the"
1228,relation of organism to organism.
1228,
1228,I do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in
1228,"understanding how several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands,"
1228,whether still retaining the same specific form or modified since their
1228,"arrival, could have reached their present homes. But the probability of"
1228,"many islands having existed as halting-places, of which not a wreck now"
1228,"remains, must not be overlooked. I will here give a single instance of"
1228,"one of the cases of difficulty. Almost all oceanic islands, even the"
1228,"most isolated and smallest, are inhabited by land-shells, generally by"
1228,"endemic species, but sometimes by species found elsewhere. Dr. Aug. A."
1228,Gould has given several interesting cases in regard to the land-shells
1228,of the islands of the Pacific. Now it is notorious that land-shells are
1228,"very easily killed by salt; their eggs, at least such as I have tried,"
1228,"sink in sea-water and are killed by it. Yet there must be, on my view,"
1228,"some unknown, but highly efficient means for their transportal. Would"
1228,the just-hatched young occasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet of
1228,"birds roosting on the ground, and thus get transported? It occurred to"
1228,"me that land-shells, when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm"
1228,"over the mouth of the shell, might be floated in chinks of drifted"
1228,timber across moderately wide arms of the sea. And I found that several
1228,species did in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in sea-water
1228,"during seven days: one of these shells was the Helix pomatia, and after"
1228,"it had again hybernated I put it in sea-water for twenty days, and it"
1228,"perfectly recovered. As this species has a thick calcareous operculum,"
1228,"I removed it, and when it had formed a new membranous one, I immersed it"
1228,"for fourteen days in sea-water, and it recovered and crawled away:"
1228,but more experiments are wanted on this head. The most striking and
1228,"important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands, is their"
1228,"affinity to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the"
1228,same species. Numerous instances could be given of this fact. I will
1228,"give only one, that of the Galapagos Archipelago, situated under the"
1228,"equator, between  and  miles from the shores of South America."
1228,Here almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeable
1228,"stamp of the American continent. There are twenty-six land birds,"
1228,"and twenty-five of these are ranked by Mr. Gould as distinct species,"
1228,supposed to have been created here; yet the close affinity of most of
1228,"these birds to American species in every character, in their habits,"
1228,"gestures, and tones of voice, was manifest. So it is with the other"
1228,"animals, and with nearly all the plants, as shown by Dr. Hooker in"
1228,"his admirable memoir on the Flora of this archipelago. The naturalist,"
1228,"looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the Pacific,"
1228,"distant several hundred miles from the continent, yet feels that he is"
1228,standing on American land. Why should this be so? why should the species
1228,"which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos Archipelago,"
1228,"and nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in"
1228,"America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the geological"
1228,"nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions"
1228,"in which the several classes are associated together, which resembles"
1228,closely the conditions of the South American coast: in fact there is
1228,"a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. On the other hand,"
1228,there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature
1228,"of the soil, in climate, height, and size of the islands, between"
1228,the Galapagos and Cape de Verde Archipelagos: but what an entire and
1228,absolute difference in their inhabitants! The inhabitants of the Cape
1228,"de Verde Islands are related to those of Africa, like those of the"
1228,Galapagos to America. I believe this grand fact can receive no sort of
1228,explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas on the
1228,"view here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would be"
1228,"likely to receive colonists, whether by occasional means of transport or"
1228,"by formerly continuous land, from America; and the Cape de Verde"
1228,Islands from Africa; and that such colonists would be liable to
1228,modification;--the principle of inheritance still betraying their
1228,original birthplace.
1228,
1228,Many analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal
1228,rule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the
1228,"nearest continent, or of other near islands. The exceptions are few, and"
1228,"most of them can be explained. Thus the plants of Kerguelen Land, though"
1228,"standing nearer to Africa than to America, are related, and that very"
1228,"closely, as we know from Dr. Hooker's account, to those of America: but"
1228,on the view that this island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought
1228,"with earth and stones on icebergs, drifted by the prevailing currents,"
1228,this anomaly disappears. New Zealand in its endemic plants is much more
1228,"closely related to Australia, the nearest mainland, than to any other"
1228,region: and this is what might have been expected; but it is also
1228,"plainly related to South America, which, although the next nearest"
1228,"continent, is so enormously remote, that the fact becomes an anomaly."
1228,"But this difficulty almost disappears on the view that both New Zealand,"
1228,"South America, and other southern lands were long ago partially stocked"
1228,"from a nearly intermediate though distant point, namely from the"
1228,"antarctic islands, when they were clothed with vegetation, before the"
1228,"commencement of the Glacial period. The affinity, which, though"
1228,"feeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker is real, between the flora of the"
1228,"south-western corner of Australia and of the Cape of Good Hope, is a far"
1228,"more remarkable case, and is at present inexplicable: but this affinity"
1228,"is confined to the plants, and will, I do not doubt, be some day"
1228,explained.
1228,
1228,"The law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago, though"
1228,"specifically distinct, to be closely allied to those of the nearest"
1228,"continent, we sometimes see displayed on a small scale, yet in a most"
1228,"interesting manner, within the limits of the same archipelago. Thus the"
1228,"several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago are tenanted, as I have"
1228,"elsewhere shown, in a quite marvellous manner, by very closely related"
1228,"species; so that the inhabitants of each separate island, though mostly"
1228,"distinct, are related in an incomparably closer degree to each other"
1228,than to the inhabitants of any other part of the world. And this is just
1228,"what might have been expected on my view, for the islands are situated"
1228,so near each other that they would almost certainly receive
1228,"immigrants from the same original source, or from each other. But this"
1228,dissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of the islands may be
1228,"used as an argument against my views; for it may be asked, how has it"
1228,"happened in the several islands situated within sight of each other,"
1228,"having the same geological nature, the same height, climate, etc., that"
1228,"many of the immigrants should have been differently modified, though"
1228,only in a small degree. This long appeared to me a great difficulty: but
1228,it arises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of considering
1228,the physical conditions of a country as the most important for its
1228,"inhabitants; whereas it cannot, I think, be disputed that the nature of"
1228,"the other inhabitants, with which each has to compete, is at least as"
1228,"important, and generally a far more important element of success. Now"
1228,if we look to those inhabitants of the Galapagos Archipelago which are
1228,found in other parts of the world (laying on one side for the moment
1228,"the endemic species, which cannot be here fairly included, as we are"
1228,"considering how they have come to be modified since their arrival), we"
1228,find a considerable amount of difference in the several islands. This
1228,difference might indeed have been expected on the view of the islands
1228,"having been stocked by occasional means of transport--a seed, for"
1228,"instance, of one plant having been brought to one island, and that of"
1228,another plant to another island. Hence when in former times an immigrant
1228,"settled on any one or more of the islands, or when it subsequently"
1228,"spread from one island to another, it would undoubtedly be exposed to"
1228,"different conditions of life in the different islands, for it would"
1228,"have to compete with different sets of organisms: a plant, for instance,"
1228,would find the best-fitted ground more perfectly occupied by distinct
1228,"plants in one island than in another, and it would be exposed to the"
1228,"attacks of somewhat different enemies. If then it varied, natural"
1228,selection would probably favour different varieties in the different
1228,"islands. Some species, however, might spread and yet retain the same"
1228,"character throughout the group, just as we see on continents some"
1228,species spreading widely and remaining the same.
1228,
1228,"The really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos Archipelago,"
1228,"and in a lesser degree in some analogous instances, is that the new"
1228,species formed in the separate islands have not quickly spread to the
1228,"other islands. But the islands, though in sight of each other, are"
1228,"separated by deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the British"
1228,"Channel, and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former"
1228,period been continuously united. The currents of the sea are rapid and
1228,"sweep across the archipelago, and gales of wind are extraordinarily"
1228,rare; so that the islands are far more effectually separated from each
1228,"other than they appear to be on a map. Nevertheless a good many species,"
1228,both those found in other parts of the world and those confined to the
1228,"archipelago, are common to the several islands, and we may infer from"
1228,certain facts that these have probably spread from some one island
1228,"to the others. But we often take, I think, an erroneous view of the"
1228,"probability of closely allied species invading each other's territory,"
1228,when put into free intercommunication. Undoubtedly if one species has
1228,"any advantage whatever over another, it will in a very brief time wholly"
1228,or in part supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for their
1228,"own places in nature, both probably will hold their own places and keep"
1228,separate for almost any length of time. Being familiar with the fact
1228,"that many species, naturalised through man's agency, have spread with"
1228,"astonishing rapidity over new countries, we are apt to infer that most"
1228,species would thus spread; but we should remember that the forms which
1228,become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied to
1228,"the aboriginal inhabitants, but are very distinct species, belonging in"
1228,"a large proportion of cases, as shown by Alph. de Candolle, to distinct"
1228,"genera. In the Galapagos Archipelago, many even of the birds, though"
1228,"so well adapted for flying from island to island, are distinct on each;"
1228,"thus there are three closely-allied species of mocking-thrush, each"
1228,confined to its own island. Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush
1228,"of Chatham Island to be blown to Charles Island, which has its own"
1228,mocking-thrush: why should it succeed in establishing itself there?
1228,We may safely infer that Charles Island is well stocked with its own
1228,"species, for annually more eggs are laid there than can possibly be"
1228,reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush peculiar to Charles
1228,Island is at least as well fitted for its home as is the species
1228,peculiar to Chatham Island. Sir C. Lyell and Mr. Wollaston have
1228,"communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject; namely,"
1228,that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo possess many
1228,"distinct but representative land-shells, some of which live in"
1228,crevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone are annually
1228,"transported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this latter island has not"
1228,become colonised by the Porto Santo species: nevertheless both islands
1228,"have been colonised by some European land-shells, which no doubt had"
1228,some advantage over the indigenous species. From these considerations
1228,I think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic and representative
1228,"species, which inhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago,"
1228,not having universally spread from island to island. In many other
1228,"instances, as in the several districts of the same continent,"
1228,pre-occupation has probably played an important part in checking the
1228,"commingling of species under the same conditions of life. Thus, the"
1228,south-east and south-west corners of Australia have nearly the same
1228,"physical conditions, and are united by continuous land, yet they are"
1228,"inhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals, birds, and plants."
1228,
1228,The principle which determines the general character of the fauna
1228,"and flora of oceanic islands, namely, that the inhabitants, when not"
1228,"identically the same, yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of"
1228,"that region whence colonists could most readily have been derived,--the"
1228,colonists having been subsequently modified and better fitted to their
1228,"new homes,--is of the widest application throughout nature. We see"
1228,"this on every mountain, in every lake and marsh. For Alpine species,"
1228,"excepting in so far as the same forms, chiefly of plants, have spread"
1228,"widely throughout the world during the recent Glacial epoch, are related"
1228,"to those of the surrounding lowlands;--thus we have in South America,"
1228,"Alpine humming-birds, Alpine rodents, Alpine plants, etc., all of"
1228,"strictly American forms, and it is obvious that a mountain, as it became"
1228,"slowly upheaved, would naturally be colonised from the surrounding"
1228,"lowlands. So it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes, excepting"
1228,in so far as great facility of transport has given the same general
1228,forms to the whole world. We see this same principle in the blind
1228,animals inhabiting the caves of America and of Europe. Other analogous
1228,"facts could be given. And it will, I believe, be universally found to"
1228,"be true, that wherever in two regions, let them be ever so distant, many"
1228,"closely allied or representative species occur, there will likewise be"
1228,"found some identical species, showing, in accordance with the foregoing"
1228,"view, that at some former period there has been intercommunication or"
1228,migration between the two regions. And wherever many closely-allied
1228,"species occur, there will be found many forms which some naturalists"
1228,"rank as distinct species, and some as varieties; these doubtful forms"
1228,showing us the steps in the process of modification.
1228,
1228,"This relation between the power and extent of migration of a species,"
1228,either at the present time or at some former period under different
1228,"physical conditions, and the existence at remote points of the world of"
1228,"other species allied to it, is shown in another and more general way."
1228,"Mr. Gould remarked to me long ago, that in those genera of birds which"
1228,"range over the world, many of the species have very wide ranges. I"
1228,"can hardly doubt that this rule is generally true, though it would be"
1228,"difficult to prove it. Amongst mammals, we see it strikingly displayed"
1228,"in Bats, and in a lesser degree in the Felidae and Canidae. We see it,"
1228,if we compare the distribution of butterflies and beetles. So it is with
1228,"most fresh-water productions, in which so many genera range over the"
1228,"world, and many individual species have enormous ranges. It is not meant"
1228,"that in world-ranging genera all the species have a wide range, or even"
1228,that they have on an AVERAGE a wide range; but only that some of the
1228,species range very widely; for the facility with which widely-ranging
1228,species vary and give rise to new forms will largely determine their
1228,"average range. For instance, two varieties of the same species inhabit"
1228,"America and Europe, and the species thus has an immense range; but, if"
1228,"the variation had been a little greater, the two varieties would have"
1228,"been ranked as distinct species, and the common range would have been"
1228,"greatly reduced. Still less is it meant, that a species which apparently"
1228,"has the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely, as in the case"
1228,"of certain powerfully-winged birds, will necessarily range widely; for"
1228,we should never forget that to range widely implies not only the power
1228,"of crossing barriers, but the more important power of being victorious"
1228,in distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign associates. But
1228,on the view of all the species of a genus having descended from a single
1228,"parent, though now distributed to the most remote points of the world,"
1228,"we ought to find, and I believe as a general rule we do find, that some"
1228,at least of the species range very widely; for it is necessary that the
1228,"unmodified parent should range widely, undergoing modification during"
1228,"its diffusion, and should place itself under diverse conditions"
1228,"favourable for the conversion of its offspring, firstly into new"
1228,varieties and ultimately into new species.
1228,
1228,"In considering the wide distribution of certain genera, we should bear"
1228,"in mind that some are extremely ancient, and must have branched off from"
1228,a common parent at a remote epoch; so that in such cases there will
1228,have been ample time for great climatal and geographical changes and for
1228,accidents of transport; and consequently for the migration of some of
1228,"the species into all quarters of the world, where they may have become"
1228,"slightly modified in relation to their new conditions. There is, also,"
1228,some reason to believe from geological evidence that organisms low in
1228,"the scale within each great class, generally change at a slower rate"
1228,than the higher forms; and consequently the lower forms will have had a
1228,better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining the same specific
1228,"character. This fact, together with the seeds and eggs of many low forms"
1228,"being very minute and better fitted for distant transportation, probably"
1228,"accounts for a law which has long been observed, and which has lately"
1228,"been admirably discussed by Alph. de Candolle in regard to plants,"
1228,"namely, that the lower any group of organisms is, the more widely it is"
1228,apt to range.
1228,
1228,"The relations just discussed,--namely, low and slowly-changing"
1228,"organisms ranging more widely than the high,--some of the species of"
1228,"widely-ranging genera themselves ranging widely,--such facts, as alpine,"
1228,"lacustrine, and marsh productions being related (with the exceptions"
1228,"before specified) to those on the surrounding low lands and dry lands,"
1228,though these stations are so different--the very close relation of the
1228,"distinct species which inhabit the islets of the same archipelago,--and"
1228,especially the striking relation of the inhabitants of each whole
1228,"archipelago or island to those of the nearest mainland,--are, I think,"
1228,utterly inexplicable on the ordinary view of the independent creation
1228,"of each species, but are explicable on the view of colonisation from the"
1228,"nearest and readiest source, together with the subsequent modification"
1228,and better adaptation of the colonists to their new homes.
1228,
1228,SUMMARY OF LAST AND PRESENT CHAPTERS.
1228,
1228,"In these chapters I have endeavoured to show, that if we make due"
1228,allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of all the changes of
1228,"climate and of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred"
1228,"within the recent period, and of other similar changes which may have"
1228,occurred within the same period; if we remember how profoundly ignorant
1228,we are with respect to the many and curious means of occasional
1228,"transport,--a subject which has hardly ever been properly experimentised"
1228,on; if we bear in mind how often a species may have ranged continuously
1228,"over a wide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate"
1228,"tracts, I think the difficulties in believing that all the individuals"
1228,"of the same species, wherever located, have descended from the same"
1228,"parents, are not insuperable. And we are led to this conclusion, which"
1228,has been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single
1228,"centres of creation, by some general considerations, more especially"
1228,from the importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution of
1228,"sub-genera, genera, and families."
1228,
1228,"With respect to the distinct species of the same genus, which on my"
1228,theory must have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same
1228,"allowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of"
1228,"life change most slowly, enormous periods of time being thus granted for"
1228,"their migration, I do not think that the difficulties are insuperable;"
1228,"though they often are in this case, and in that of the individuals of"
1228,"the same species, extremely grave."
1228,
1228,"As exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution, I have"
1228,attempted to show how important has been the influence of the modern
1228,"Glacial period, which I am fully convinced simultaneously affected"
1228,"the whole world, or at least great meridional belts. As showing how"
1228,"diversified are the means of occasional transport, I have discussed at"
1228,some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions.
1228,
1228,If the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long
1228,"course of time the individuals of the same species, and likewise of"
1228,"allied species, have proceeded from some one source; then I think all"
1228,the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on
1228,"the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life),"
1228,together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new
1228,"forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether"
1228,"of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical"
1228,"provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera,"
1228,"genera, and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for"
1228,"instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains,"
1228,"of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner"
1228,"linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct"
1228,beings which formerly inhabited the same continent. Bearing in mind
1228,that the mutual relations of organism to organism are of the highest
1228,"importance, we can see why two areas having nearly the same physical"
1228,conditions should often be inhabited by very different forms of
1228,life; for according to the length of time which has elapsed since
1228,new inhabitants entered one region; according to the nature of the
1228,"communication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter,"
1228,"either in greater or lesser numbers; according or not, as those which"
1228,entered happened to come in more or less direct competition with each
1228,other and with the aborigines; and according as the immigrants were
1228,"capable of varying more or less rapidly, there would ensue in different"
1228,"regions, independently of their physical conditions, infinitely"
1228,"diversified conditions of life,--there would be an almost endless amount"
1228,"of organic action and reaction,--and we should find, as we do find,"
1228,"some groups of beings greatly, and some only slightly modified,--some"
1228,"developed in great force, some existing in scanty numbers--in the"
1228,different great geographical provinces of the world.
1228,
1228,"On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to"
1228,"show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a"
1228,"great number should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in relation to the"
1228,"means of migration, one group of beings, even within the same class,"
1228,"should have all its species endemic, and another group should have all"
1228,its species common to other quarters of the world. We can see why whole
1228,"groups of organisms, as batrachians and terrestrial mammals, should be"
1228,"absent from oceanic islands, whilst the most isolated islands possess"
1228,their own peculiar species of aerial mammals or bats. We can see why
1228,"there should be some relation between the presence of mammals, in a more"
1228,"or less modified condition, and the depth of the sea between an island"
1228,and the mainland. We can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an
1228,"archipelago, though specifically distinct on the several islets, should"
1228,"be closely related to each other, and likewise be related, but less"
1228,"closely, to those of the nearest continent or other source whence"
1228,"immigrants were probably derived. We can see why in two areas, however"
1228,"distant from each other, there should be a correlation, in the presence"
1228,"of identical species, of varieties, of doubtful species, and of distinct"
1228,but representative species.
1228,
1228,"As the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking"
1228,parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space: the laws
1228,governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same
1228,with those governing at the present time the differences in different
1228,areas. We see this in many facts. The endurance of each species and
1228,group of species is continuous in time; for the exceptions to the rule
1228,"are so few, that they may fairly be attributed to our not having as"
1228,yet discovered in an intermediate deposit the forms which are therein
1228,"absent, but which occur above and below: so in space, it certainly is"
1228,"the general rule that the area inhabited by a single species, or by a"
1228,"group of species, is continuous; and the exceptions, which are not rare,"
1228,"may, as I have attempted to show, be accounted for by migration at"
1228,some former period under different conditions or by occasional means of
1228,"transport, and by the species having become extinct in the intermediate"
1228,"tracts. Both in time and space, species and groups of species have their"
1228,"points of maximum development. Groups of species, belonging either to a"
1228,"certain period of time, or to a certain area, are often characterised by"
1228,"trifling characters in common, as of sculpture or colour. In looking"
1228,"to the long succession of ages, as in now looking to distant provinces"
1228,"throughout the world, we find that some organisms differ little, whilst"
1228,"others belonging to a different class, or to a different order, or even"
1228,"only to a different family of the same order, differ greatly. In both"
1228,time and space the lower members of each class generally change less
1228,than the higher; but there are in both cases marked exceptions to the
1228,rule. On my theory these several relations throughout time and space
1228,are intelligible; for whether we look to the forms of life which have
1228,"changed during successive ages within the same quarter of the world, or"
1228,"to those which have changed after having migrated into distant quarters,"
1228,in both cases the forms within each class have been connected by the
1228,same bond of ordinary generation; and the more nearly any two forms are
1228,"related in blood, the nearer they will generally stand to each other in"
1228,"time and space; in both cases the laws of variation have been the same,"
1228,and modifications have been accumulated by the same power of natural
1228,selection.

1228,ORGANS; their origin explained. Summary.
1228,
1228,"From the first dawn of life, all organic beings are found to resemble"
1228,"each other in descending degrees, so that they can be classed in groups"
1228,under groups. This classification is evidently not arbitrary like the
1228,grouping of the stars in constellations. The existence of groups would
1228,"have been of simple signification, if one group had been exclusively"
1228,"fitted to inhabit the land, and another the water; one to feed on flesh,"
1228,"another on vegetable matter, and so on; but the case is widely different"
1228,in nature; for it is notorious how commonly members of even the same
1228,"subgroup have different habits. In our second and fourth chapters, on"
1228,"Variation and on Natural Selection, I have attempted to show that it is"
1228,"the widely ranging, the much diffused and common, that is the dominant"
1228,"species belonging to the larger genera, which vary most. The varieties,"
1228,"or incipient species, thus produced ultimately become converted, as I"
1228,"believe, into new and distinct species; and these, on the principle"
1228,"of inheritance, tend to produce other new and dominant species."
1228,"Consequently the groups which are now large, and which generally include"
1228,"many dominant species, tend to go on increasing indefinitely in size."
1228,I further attempted to show that from the varying descendants of each
1228,species trying to occupy as many and as different places as possible in
1228,"the economy of nature, there is a constant tendency in their characters"
1228,to diverge. This conclusion was supported by looking at the great
1228,"diversity of the forms of life which, in any small area, come into the"
1228,"closest competition, and by looking to certain facts in naturalisation."
1228,
1228,I attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the forms
1228,"which are increasing in number and diverging in character, to supplant"
1228,"and exterminate the less divergent, the less improved, and preceding"
1228,forms. I request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the
1228,"action, as formerly explained, of these several principles; and he"
1228,will see that the inevitable result is that the modified descendants
1228,proceeding from one progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate
1228,to groups. In the diagram each letter on the uppermost line may
1228,represent a genus including several species; and all the genera on this
1228,"line form together one class, for all have descended from one ancient"
1228,"but unseen parent, and, consequently, have inherited something in"
1228,"common. But the three genera on the left hand have, on this same"
1228,"principle, much in common, and form a sub-family, distinct from that"
1228,"including the next two genera on the right hand, which diverged from a"
1228,common parent at the fifth stage of descent. These five genera have also
1228,"much, though less, in common; and they form a family distinct from"
1228,"that including the three genera still further to the right hand, which"
1228,"diverged at a still earlier period. And all these genera, descended from"
1228,"(A), form an order distinct from the genera descended from (I). So that"
1228,we here have many species descended from a single progenitor grouped
1228,"into genera; and the genera are included in, or subordinate to,"
1228,"sub-families, families, and orders, all united into one class. Thus, the"
1228,"grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group,"
1228,"which, from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is"
1228,in my judgment fully explained.
1228,
1228,"Naturalists try to arrange the species, genera, and families in each"
1228,"class, on what is called the Natural System. But what is meant by"
1228,this system? Some authors look at it merely as a scheme for arranging
1228,"together those living objects which are most alike, and for separating"
1228,"those which are most unlike; or as an artificial means for enunciating,"
1228,"as briefly as possible, general propositions,--that is, by one sentence"
1228,"to give the characters common, for instance, to all mammals, by another"
1228,"those common to all carnivora, by another those common to the dog-genus,"
1228,"and then by adding a single sentence, a full description is given"
1228,of each kind of dog. The ingenuity and utility of this system are
1228,indisputable. But many naturalists think that something more is meant
1228,by the Natural System; they believe that it reveals the plan of the
1228,"Creator; but unless it be specified whether order in time or space,"
1228,"or what else is meant by the plan of the Creator, it seems to me that"
1228,nothing is thus added to our knowledge. Such expressions as that
1228,"famous one of Linnaeus, and which we often meet with in a more or less"
1228,"concealed form, that the characters do not make the genus, but that"
1228,"the genus gives the characters, seem to imply that something more is"
1228,"included in our classification, than mere resemblance. I believe that"
1228,"something more is included; and that propinquity of descent,--the only"
1228,"known cause of the similarity of organic beings,--is the bond, hidden as"
1228,"it is by various degrees of modification, which is partially revealed to"
1228,us by our classifications.
1228,
1228,"Let us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the"
1228,difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification
1228,"either gives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for"
1228,enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most
1228,like each other. It might have been thought (and was in ancient times
1228,thought) that those parts of the structure which determined the habits
1228,"of life, and the general place of each being in the economy of nature,"
1228,would be of very high importance in classification. Nothing can be more
1228,"false. No one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of"
1228,"a dugong to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any importance. These"
1228,"resemblances, though so intimately connected with the whole life of the"
1228,"being, are ranked as merely ""adaptive or analogical characters;"" but to"
1228,the consideration of these resemblances we shall have to recur. It
1228,"may even be given as a general rule, that the less any part of the"
1228,"organisation is concerned with special habits, the more important it"
1228,"becomes for classification. As an instance: Owen, in speaking of the"
1228,"dugong, says, ""The generative organs being those which are most remotely"
1228,"related to the habits and food of an animal, I have always regarded as"
1228,affording very clear indications of its true affinities. We are least
1228,likely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive
1228,"for an essential character."" So with plants, how remarkable it is that"
1228,"the organs of vegetation, on which their whole life depends, are of"
1228,"little signification, excepting in the first main divisions; whereas the"
1228,"organs of reproduction, with their product the seed, are of paramount"
1228,importance!
1228,
1228,"We must not, therefore, in classifying, trust to resemblances in parts"
1228,"of the organisation, however important they may be for the welfare of"
1228,the being in relation to the outer world. Perhaps from this cause it has
1228,"partly arisen, that almost all naturalists lay the greatest stress on"
1228,resemblances in organs of high vital or physiological importance. No
1228,doubt this view of the classificatory importance of organs which
1228,"are important is generally, but by no means always, true. But their"
1228,"importance for classification, I believe, depends on their greater"
1228,constancy throughout large groups of species; and this constancy depends
1228,on such organs having generally been subjected to less change in the
1228,adaptation of the species to their conditions of life. That the
1228,mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine its
1228,"classificatory value, is almost shown by the one fact, that in allied"
1228,"groups, in which the same organ, as we have every reason to suppose, has"
1228,"nearly the same physiological value, its classificatory value is widely"
1228,different. No naturalist can have worked at any group without being
1228,struck with this fact; and it has been most fully acknowledged in the
1228,writings of almost every author. It will suffice to quote the highest
1228,"authority, Robert Brown, who in speaking of certain organs in the"
1228,"Proteaceae, says their generic importance, ""like that of all their"
1228,"parts, not only in this but, as I apprehend, in every natural family,"
1228,"is very unequal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost."" Again in"
1228,"another work he says, the genera of the Connaraceae ""differ in having"
1228,"one or more ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the"
1228,imbricate or valvular aestivation. Any one of these characters singly
1228,"is frequently of more than generic importance, though here even when"
1228,all taken together they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis from
1228,"Connarus."" To give an example amongst insects, in one great division"
1228,"of the Hymenoptera, the antennae, as Westwood has remarked, are most"
1228,"constant in structure; in another division they differ much, and the"
1228,differences are of quite subordinate value in classification; yet no one
1228,probably will say that the antennae in these two divisions of the same
1228,order are of unequal physiological importance. Any number of instances
1228,could be given of the varying importance for classification of the same
1228,important organ within the same group of beings.
1228,
1228,"Again, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high"
1228,"physiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in this"
1228,condition are often of high value in classification. No one will dispute
1228,"that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants,"
1228,"and certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly serviceable in"
1228,exhibiting the close affinity between Ruminants and Pachyderms. Robert
1228,Brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the rudimentary florets are
1228,of the highest importance in the classification of the Grasses.
1228,
1228,Numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which
1228,"must be considered of very trifling physiological importance, but which"
1228,are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of
1228,"whole groups. For instance, whether or not there is an open passage from"
1228,"the nostrils to the mouth, the only character, according to Owen, which"
1228,absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles--the inflection of the
1228,angle of the jaws in Marsupials--the manner in which the wings of
1228,insects are folded--mere colour in certain Algae--mere pubescence on
1228,"parts of the flower in grasses--the nature of the dermal covering, as"
1228,"hair or feathers, in the Vertebrata. If the Ornithorhynchus had been"
1228,"covered with feathers instead of hair, this external and trifling"
1228,"character would, I think, have been considered by naturalists as"
1228,important an aid in determining the degree of affinity of this strange
1228,"creature to birds and reptiles, as an approach in structure in any one"
1228,internal and important organ.
1228,
1228,"The importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly"
1228,depends on their being correlated with several other characters of more
1228,or less importance. The value indeed of an aggregate of characters is
1228,"very evident in natural history. Hence, as has often been remarked, a"
1228,"species may depart from its allies in several characters, both of high"
1228,"physiological importance and of almost universal prevalence, and yet"
1228,"leave us in no doubt where it should be ranked. Hence, also, it has been"
1228,"found, that a classification founded on any single character,"
1228,"however important that may be, has always failed; for no part of the"
1228,organisation is universally constant. The importance of an aggregate of
1228,"characters, even when none are important, alone explains, I think, that"
1228,"saying of Linnaeus, that the characters do not give the genus, but"
1228,the genus gives the characters; for this saying seems founded on an
1228,"appreciation of many trifling points of resemblance, too slight to be"
1228,"defined. Certain plants, belonging to the Malpighiaceae, bear perfect"
1228,"and degraded flowers; in the latter, as A. de Jussieu has remarked, ""the"
1228,"greater number of the characters proper to the species, to the genus,"
1228,"to the family, to the class, disappear, and thus laugh at our"
1228,"classification."" But when Aspicarpa produced in France, during several"
1228,"years, only degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a number"
1228,of the most important points of structure from the proper type of the
1228,"order, yet M. Richard sagaciously saw, as Jussieu observes, that this"
1228,genus should still be retained amongst the Malpighiaceae. This case
1228,seems to me well to illustrate the spirit with which our classifications
1228,are sometimes necessarily founded.
1228,
1228,"Practically when naturalists are at work, they do not trouble themselves"
1228,about the physiological value of the characters which they use in
1228,"defining a group, or in allocating any particular species. If they find"
1228,"a character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of forms, and"
1228,"not common to others, they use it as one of high value; if common to"
1228,"some lesser number, they use it as of subordinate value. This principle"
1228,has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one; and
1228,"by none more clearly than by that excellent botanist, Aug. St. Hilaire."
1228,"If certain characters are always found correlated with others, though"
1228,"no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them, especial"
1228,"value is set on them. As in most groups of animals, important organs,"
1228,"such as those for propelling the blood, or for aerating it, or those for"
1228,"propagating the race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as"
1228,highly serviceable in classification; but in some groups of animals all
1228,"these, the most important vital organs, are found to offer characters of"
1228,quite subordinate value.
1228,
1228,We can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal
1228,"importance with those derived from the adult, for our classifications of"
1228,"course include all ages of each species. But it is by no means obvious,"
1228,"on the ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should be more"
1228,"important for this purpose than that of the adult, which alone plays its"
1228,full part in the economy of nature. Yet it has been strongly urged
1228,"by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards and Agassiz, that embryonic"
1228,characters are the most important of any in the classification of
1228,animals; and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true.
1228,"The same fact holds good with flowering plants, of which the two main"
1228,"divisions have been founded on characters derived from the embryo,--on"
1228,"the number and position of the embryonic leaves or cotyledons, and on"
1228,the mode of development of the plumule and radicle. In our discussion
1228,"on embryology, we shall see why such characters are so valuable, on the"
1228,view of classification tacitly including the idea of descent.
1228,
1228,Our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of
1228,affinities. Nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters
1228,"common to all birds; but in the case of crustaceans, such definition has"
1228,hitherto been found impossible. There are crustaceans at the opposite
1228,"ends of the series, which have hardly a character in common; yet the"
1228,"species at both ends, from being plainly allied to others, and these to"
1228,"others, and so onwards, can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to"
1228,"this, and to no other class of the Articulata."
1228,
1228,"Geographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not quite"
1228,"logically, in classification, more especially in very large groups of"
1228,closely allied forms. Temminck insists on the utility or even necessity
1228,of this practice in certain groups of birds; and it has been followed by
1228,several entomologists and botanists.
1228,
1228,"Finally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of"
1228,"species, such as orders, sub-orders, families, sub-families, and genera,"
1228,"they seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary. Several of the"
1228,"best botanists, such as Mr. Bentham and others, have strongly insisted"
1228,on their arbitrary value. Instances could be given amongst plants and
1228,"insects, of a group of forms, first ranked by practised naturalists as"
1228,"only a genus, and then raised to the rank of a sub-family or family; and"
1228,"this has been done, not because further research has detected important"
1228,"structural differences, at first overlooked, but because numerous"
1228,"allied species, with slightly different grades of difference, have been"
1228,subsequently discovered.
1228,
1228,All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification
1228,"are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that"
1228,the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the
1228,characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between
1228,"any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a"
1228,"common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical;"
1228,that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been
1228,"unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the"
1228,"enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together and"
1228,separating objects more or less alike.
1228,
1228,But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe that the ARRANGEMENT
1228,"of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to"
1228,"the other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural;"
1228,"but that the AMOUNT of difference in the several branches or groups,"
1228,"though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor,"
1228,"may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification"
1228,which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being
1228,"ranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders. The reader"
1228,"will best understand what is meant, if he will take the trouble of"
1228,referring to the diagram in the fourth chapter. We will suppose the
1228,"letters A to L to represent allied genera, which lived during the"
1228,"Silurian epoch, and these have descended from a species which existed at"
1228,"an unknown anterior period. Species of three of these genera (A, F, and"
1228,"I) have transmitted modified descendants to the present day, represented"
1228,by the fifteen genera (a to z) on the uppermost horizontal line. Now
1228,"all these modified descendants from a single species, are represented as"
1228,related in blood or descent to the same degree; they may metaphorically
1228,be called cousins to the same millionth degree; yet they differ widely
1228,"and in different degrees from each other. The forms descended from A,"
1228,"now broken up into two or three families, constitute a distinct order"
1228,"from those descended from I, also broken up into two families. Nor can"
1228,"the existing species, descended from A, be ranked in the same genus with"
1228,"the parent A; or those from I, with the parent I. But the existing genus"
1228,F may be supposed to have been but slightly modified; and it will
1228,then rank with the parent-genus F; just as some few still living organic
1228,beings belong to Silurian genera. So that the amount or value of the
1228,differences between organic beings all related to each other in the same
1228,"degree in blood, has come to be widely different. Nevertheless their"
1228,"genealogical ARRANGEMENT remains strictly true, not only at the present"
1228,"time, but at each successive period of descent. All the modified"
1228,descendants from A will have inherited something in common from their
1228,"common parent, as will all the descendants from I; so will it be with"
1228,"each subordinate branch of descendants, at each successive period. If,"
1228,"however, we choose to suppose that any of the descendants of A or of"
1228,I have been so much modified as to have more or less completely lost
1228,"traces of their parentage, in this case, their places in a natural"
1228,"classification will have been more or less completely lost,--as"
1228,sometimes seems to have occurred with existing organisms. All the
1228,"descendants of the genus F, along its whole line of descent, are"
1228,"supposed to have been but little modified, and they yet form a single"
1228,"genus. But this genus, though much isolated, will still occupy its"
1228,proper intermediate position; for F originally was intermediate in
1228,"character between A and I, and the several genera descended from these"
1228,two genera will have inherited to a certain extent their characters.
1228,"This natural arrangement is shown, as far as is possible on paper, in"
1228,"the diagram, but in much too simple a manner. If a branching diagram had"
1228,"not been used, and only the names of the groups had been written in a"
1228,"linear series, it would have been still less possible to have given a"
1228,natural arrangement; and it is notoriously not possible to represent in
1228,"a series, on a flat surface, the affinities which we discover in nature"
1228,"amongst the beings of the same group. Thus, on the view which I hold,"
1228,"the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a pedigree;"
1228,but the degrees of modification which the different groups have
1228,"undergone, have to be expressed by ranking them under different"
1228,"so-called genera, sub-families, families, sections, orders, and classes."
1228,
1228,"It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by"
1228,taking the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of
1228,"mankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the"
1228,best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the
1228,"world; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly"
1228,"changing dialects, had to be included, such an arrangement would, I"
1228,"think, be the only possible one. Yet it might be that some very ancient"
1228,"language had altered little, and had given rise to few new languages,"
1228,whilst others (owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and
1228,"states of civilisation of the several races, descended from a common"
1228,"race) had altered much, and had given rise to many new languages and"
1228,dialects. The various degrees of difference in the languages from the
1228,"same stock, would have to be expressed by groups subordinate to"
1228,groups; but the proper or even only possible arrangement would still be
1228,"genealogical; and this would be strictly natural, as it would connect"
1228,"together all languages, extinct and modern, by the closest affinities,"
1228,and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue.
1228,
1228,"In confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification"
1228,"of varieties, which are believed or known to have descended from one"
1228,"species. These are grouped under species, with sub-varieties under"
1228,"varieties; and with our domestic productions, several other grades of"
1228,"difference are requisite, as we have seen with pigeons. The origin"
1228,"of the existence of groups subordinate to groups, is the same with"
1228,"varieties as with species, namely, closeness of descent with various"
1228,degrees of modification. Nearly the same rules are followed in
1228,"classifying varieties, as with species. Authors have insisted on the"
1228,necessity of classing varieties on a natural instead of an artificial
1228,"system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of"
1228,"the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most"
1228,"important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the swedish"
1228,"and common turnips together, though the esculent and thickened stems"
1228,"are so similar. Whatever part is found to be most constant, is used in"
1228,classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns
1228,"are very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less"
1228,"variable than the shape or colour of the body, etc.; whereas with sheep"
1228,"the horns are much less serviceable, because less constant. In classing"
1228,"varieties, I apprehend if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical"
1228,classification would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted
1228,"by some authors. For we might feel sure, whether there had been more"
1228,"or less modification, the principle of inheritance would keep the forms"
1228,together which were allied in the greatest number of points. In tumbler
1228,"pigeons, though some sub-varieties differ from the others in the"
1228,"important character of having a longer beak, yet all are kept together"
1228,from having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has
1228,"nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any reasoning"
1228,"or thinking on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group,"
1228,because allied in blood and alike in some other respects. If it could be
1228,"proved that the Hottentot had descended from the Negro, I think he would"
1228,"be classed under the Negro group, however much he might differ in colour"
1228,and other important characters from negroes.
1228,
1228,"With species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought"
1228,"descent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade,"
1228,"or that of a species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes"
1228,"differ in the most important characters, is known to every naturalist:"
1228,scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the males and
1228,"hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, when adult, and yet no one dreams"
1228,of separating them. The naturalist includes as one species the several
1228,"larval stages of the same individual, however much they may differ from"
1228,each other and from the adult; as he likewise includes the so-called
1228,"alternate generations of Steenstrup, which can only in a technical sense"
1228,be considered as the same individual. He includes monsters; he includes
1228,"varieties, not solely because they closely resemble the parent-form, but"
1228,because they are descended from it. He who believes that the cowslip
1228,"is descended from the primrose, or conversely, ranks them together as"
1228,"a single species, and gives a single definition. As soon as three"
1228,"Orchidean forms (Monochanthus, Myanthus, and Catasetum), which had"
1228,"previously been ranked as three distinct genera, were known to be"
1228,"sometimes produced on the same spike, they were immediately included as"
1228,"a single species. But it may be asked, what ought we to do, if it could"
1228,"be proved that one species of kangaroo had been produced, by a long"
1228,"course of modification, from a bear? Ought we to rank this one"
1228,"species with bears, and what should we do with the other species?"
1228,The supposition is of course preposterous; and I might answer by the
1228,"argumentum ad hominem, and ask what should be done if a perfect kangaroo"
1228,"were seen to come out of the womb of a bear? According to all analogy,"
1228,it would be ranked with bears; but then assuredly all the other species
1228,of the kangaroo family would have to be classed under the bear genus.
1228,The whole case is preposterous; for where there has been close descent
1228,"in common, there will certainly be close resemblance or affinity."
1228,
1228,As descent has universally been used in classing together the
1228,"individuals of the same species, though the males and females and larvae"
1228,are sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used in classing
1228,"varieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable"
1228,"amount of modification, may not this same element of descent have been"
1228,"unconsciously used in grouping species under genera, and genera under"
1228,"higher groups, though in these cases the modification has been greater"
1228,"in degree, and has taken a longer time to complete? I believe it has"
1228,thus been unconsciously used; and only thus can I understand the several
1228,rules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists. We
1228,have no written pedigrees; we have to make out community of descent by
1228,"resemblances of any kind. Therefore we choose those characters which,"
1228,"as far as we can judge, are the least likely to have been modified"
1228,in relation to the conditions of life to which each species has been
1228,"recently exposed. Rudimentary structures on this view are as good as, or"
1228,"even sometimes better than, other parts of the organisation. We care not"
1228,how trifling a character may be--let it be the mere inflection of
1228,"the angle of the jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded,"
1228,whether the skin be covered by hair or feathers--if it prevail
1228,"throughout many and different species, especially those having very"
1228,"different habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for"
1228,"its presence in so many forms with such different habits, only by its"
1228,inheritance from a common parent. We may err in this respect in regard
1228,"to single points of structure, but when several characters, let them"
1228,"be ever so trifling, occur together throughout a large group of beings"
1228,"having different habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of"
1228,"descent, that these characters have been inherited from a common"
1228,ancestor. And we know that such correlated or aggregated characters have
1228,especial value in classification.
1228,
1228,"We can understand why a species or a group of species may depart, in"
1228,"several of its most important characteristics, from its allies, and yet"
1228,"be safely classed with them. This may be safely done, and is often"
1228,"done, as long as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so"
1228,"unimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of descent. Let two"
1228,"forms have not a single character in common, yet if these extreme forms"
1228,"are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at"
1228,"once infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the same"
1228,class. As we find organs of high physiological importance--those
1228,which serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of
1228,"existence--are generally the most constant, we attach especial value to"
1228,"them; but if these same organs, in another group or section of a"
1228,"group, are found to differ much, we at once value them less in"
1228,"our classification. We shall hereafter, I think, clearly see why"
1228,embryological characters are of such high classificatory importance.
1228,Geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully into play in
1228,"classing large and widely-distributed genera, because all the species of"
1228,"the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and isolated region, have in all"
1228,probability descended from the same parents.
1228,
1228,"We can understand, on these views, the very important distinction"
1228,between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances.
1228,"Lamarck first called attention to this distinction, and he has been ably"
1228,"followed by Macleay and others. The resemblance, in the shape of the"
1228,"body and in the fin-like anterior limbs, between the dugong, which is a"
1228,"pachydermatous animal, and the whale, and between both these mammals and"
1228,"fishes, is analogical. Amongst insects there are innumerable instances:"
1228,"thus Linnaeus, misled by external appearances, actually classed an"
1228,homopterous insect as a moth. We see something of the same kind even
1228,"in our domestic varieties, as in the thickened stems of the common and"
1228,swedish turnip. The resemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardly
1228,more fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors
1228,between very distinct animals. On my view of characters being of real
1228,"importance for classification, only in so far as they reveal descent, we"
1228,"can clearly understand why analogical or adaptive character, although of"
1228,"the utmost importance to the welfare of the being, are almost valueless"
1228,"to the systematist. For animals, belonging to two most distinct lines"
1228,"of descent, may readily become adapted to similar conditions, and thus"
1228,assume a close external resemblance; but such resemblances will not
1228,reveal--will rather tend to conceal their blood-relationship to their
1228,"proper lines of descent. We can also understand the apparent paradox,"
1228,that the very same characters are analogical when one class or order is
1228,"compared with another, but give true affinities when the members of the"
1228,same class or order are compared one with another: thus the shape of
1228,the body and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared
1228,"with fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the"
1228,water; but the shape of the body and fin-like limbs serve as characters
1228,exhibiting true affinity between the several members of the whale
1228,"family; for these cetaceans agree in so many characters, great and"
1228,"small, that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general shape"
1228,of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor. So it is with
1228,fishes.
1228,
1228,As members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive
1228,"slight modifications to live under nearly similar circumstances,--to"
1228,"inhabit for instance the three elements of land, air, and water,--we can"
1228,perhaps understand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes
1228,"been observed between the sub-groups in distinct classes. A naturalist,"
1228,"struck by a parallelism of this nature in any one class, by arbitrarily"
1228,raising or sinking the value of the groups in other classes (and all our
1228,"experience shows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary), could"
1228,"easily extend the parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary,"
1228,"quinary, quaternary, and ternary classifications have probably arisen."
1228,
1228,"As the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger"
1228,"genera, tend to inherit the advantages, which made the groups to which"
1228,"they belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to"
1228,"spread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy"
1228,of nature. The larger and more dominant groups thus tend to go on
1228,increasing in size; and they consequently supplant many smaller and
1228,"feebler groups. Thus we can account for the fact that all organisms,"
1228,"recent and extinct, are included under a few great orders, under still"
1228,"fewer classes, and all in one great natural system. As showing how"
1228,"few the higher groups are in number, and how widely spread they are"
1228,"throughout the world, the fact is striking, that the discovery of"
1228,Australia has not added a single insect belonging to a new order; and
1228,"that in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn from Dr. Hooker, it has added"
1228,only two or three orders of small size.
1228,
1228,"In the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the"
1228,principle of each group having generally diverged much in character
1228,"during the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the"
1228,more ancient forms of life often present characters in some slight
1228,degree intermediate between existing groups. A few old and intermediate
1228,parent-forms having occasionally transmitted to the present day
1228,"descendants but little modified, will give to us our so-called osculant"
1228,"or aberrant groups. The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be"
1228,the number of connecting forms which on my theory have been exterminated
1228,and utterly lost. And we have some evidence of aberrant forms having
1228,"suffered severely from extinction, for they are generally represented by"
1228,extremely few species; and such species as do occur are generally very
1228,"distinct from each other, which again implies extinction. The genera"
1228,"Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, for example, would not have been less"
1228,aberrant had each been represented by a dozen species instead of by
1228,"a single one; but such richness in species, as I find after some"
1228,"investigation, does not commonly fall to the lot of aberrant genera. We"
1228,"can, I think, account for this fact only by looking at aberrant forms"
1228,"as failing groups conquered by more successful competitors, with a"
1228,few members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourable
1228,circumstances.
1228,
1228,"Mr. Waterhouse has remarked that, when a member belonging to one group"
1228,"of animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this affinity"
1228,"in most cases is general and not special: thus, according to Mr."
1228,"Waterhouse, of all Rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to"
1228,"Marsupials; but in the points in which it approaches this order, its"
1228,"relations are general, and not to any one marsupial species more than"
1228,to another. As the points of affinity of the bizcacha to Marsupials are
1228,"believed to be real and not merely adaptive, they are due on my theory"
1228,to inheritance in common. Therefore we must suppose either that all
1228,"Rodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some very ancient"
1228,"Marsupial, which will have had a character in some degree intermediate"
1228,with respect to all existing Marsupials; or that both Rodents and
1228,"Marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that both groups"
1228,have since undergone much modification in divergent directions.
1228,"On either view we may suppose that the bizcacha has retained, by"
1228,"inheritance, more of the character of its ancient progenitor than have"
1228,other Rodents; and therefore it will not be specially related to any one
1228,"existing Marsupial, but indirectly to all or nearly all Marsupials, from"
1228,"having partially retained the character of their common progenitor, or"
1228,"of an early member of the group. On the other hand, of all Marsupials,"
1228,"as Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the phascolomys resembles most nearly,"
1228,"not any one species, but the general order of Rodents. In this case,"
1228,"however, it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only"
1228,"analogical, owing to the phascolomys having become adapted to habits"
1228,like those of a Rodent. The elder De Candolle has made nearly similar
1228,observations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct orders
1228,of plants.
1228,
1228,On the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in
1228,"character of the species descended from a common parent, together with"
1228,"their retention by inheritance of some characters in common, we can"
1228,understand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all
1228,the members of the same family or higher group are connected together.
1228,"For the common parent of a whole family of species, now broken up by"
1228,"extinction into distinct groups and sub-groups, will have transmitted"
1228,"some of its characters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all;"
1228,and the several species will consequently be related to each other by
1228,circuitous lines of affinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the
1228,"diagram so often referred to), mounting up through many predecessors."
1228,As it is difficult to show the blood-relationship between the
1228,"numerous kindred of any ancient and noble family, even by the aid of a"
1228,"genealogical tree, and almost impossible to do this without this aid,"
1228,we can understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have
1228,"experienced in describing, without the aid of a diagram, the various"
1228,affinities which they perceive between the many living and extinct
1228,members of the same great natural class.
1228,
1228,"Extinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an"
1228,important part in defining and widening the intervals between the
1228,several groups in each class. We may thus account even for the
1228,"distinctness of whole classes from each other--for instance, of birds"
1228,from all other vertebrate animals--by the belief that many ancient forms
1228,"of life have been utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of"
1228,birds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other
1228,vertebrate classes. There has been less entire extinction of the forms
1228,of life which once connected fishes with batrachians. There has been
1228,"still less in some other classes, as in that of the Crustacea, for here"
1228,"the most wonderfully diverse forms are still tied together by a long,"
1228,"but broken, chain of affinities. Extinction has only separated groups:"
1228,it has by no means made them; for if every form which has ever lived
1228,"on this earth were suddenly to reappear, though it would be"
1228,quite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be
1228,"distinguished from other groups, as all would blend together by steps"
1228,"as fine as those between the finest existing varieties, nevertheless"
1228,"a natural classification, or at least a natural arrangement, would be"
1228,"possible. We shall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters, A"
1228,"to L, may represent eleven Silurian genera, some of which have produced"
1228,large groups of modified descendants. Every intermediate link between
1228,"these eleven genera and their primordial parent, and every intermediate"
1228,"link in each branch and sub-branch of their descendants, may be supposed"
1228,to be still alive; and the links to be as fine as those between the
1228,finest varieties. In this case it would be quite impossible to give any
1228,definition by which the several members of the several groups could be
1228,distinguished from their more immediate parents; or these parents from
1228,their ancient and unknown progenitor. Yet the natural arrangement in the
1228,"diagram would still hold good; and, on the principle of inheritance, all"
1228,"the forms descended from A, or from I, would have something in common."
1228,"In a tree we can specify this or that branch, though at the actual fork"
1228,"the two unite and blend together. We could not, as I have said, define"
1228,"the several groups; but we could pick out types, or forms, representing"
1228,"most of the characters of each group, whether large or small, and thus"
1228,give a general idea of the value of the differences between them. This
1228,"is what we should be driven to, if we were ever to succeed in collecting"
1228,all the forms in any class which have lived throughout all time
1228,and space. We shall certainly never succeed in making so perfect a
1228,"collection: nevertheless, in certain classes, we are tending in this"
1228,"direction; and Milne Edwards has lately insisted, in an able paper, on"
1228,"the high importance of looking to types, whether or not we can separate"
1228,and define the groups to which such types belong.
1228,
1228,"Finally, we have seen that natural selection, which results from the"
1228,"struggle for existence, and which almost inevitably induces extinction"
1228,and divergence of character in the many descendants from one dominant
1228,"parent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the"
1228,"affinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group"
1228,under group. We use the element of descent in classing the individuals
1228,"of both sexes and of all ages, although having few characters in common,"
1228,"under one species; we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties,"
1228,however different they may be from their parent; and I believe this
1228,element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists
1228,have sought under the term of the Natural System. On this idea of the
1228,"natural system being, in so far as it has been perfected, genealogical"
1228,"in its arrangement, with the grades of difference between the"
1228,"descendants from a common parent, expressed by the terms genera,"
1228,"families, orders, etc., we can understand the rules which we are"
1228,compelled to follow in our classification. We can understand why we
1228,value certain resemblances far more than others; why we are permitted to
1228,"use rudimentary and useless organs, or others of trifling physiological"
1228,"importance; why, in comparing one group with a distinct group, we"
1228,"summarily reject analogical or adaptive characters, and yet use these"
1228,same characters within the limits of the same group. We can clearly see
1228,how it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together
1228,in one great system; and how the several members of each class
1228,are connected together by the most complex and radiating lines of
1228,"affinities. We shall never, probably, disentangle the inextricable web"
1228,of affinities between the members of any one class; but when we have
1228,"a distinct object in view, and do not look to some unknown plan of"
1228,"creation, we may hope to make sure but slow progress."
1228,
1228,MORPHOLOGY.
1228,
1228,"We have seen that the members of the same class, independently of"
1228,"their habits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of their"
1228,"organisation. This resemblance is often expressed by the term ""unity of"
1228,"type;"" or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different"
1228,species of the class are homologous. The whole subject is included under
1228,the general name of Morphology. This is the most interesting department
1228,"of natural history, and may be said to be its very soul. What can be"
1228,"more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a"
1228,"mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and"
1228,"the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and"
1228,"should include the same bones, in the same relative positions? Geoffroy"
1228,St. Hilaire has insisted strongly on the high importance of relative
1228,connexion in homologous organs: the parts may change to almost any
1228,"extent in form and size, and yet they always remain connected together"
1228,"in the same order. We never find, for instance, the bones of the arm and"
1228,"forearm, or of the thigh and leg, transposed. Hence the same names can"
1228,be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals. We see the
1228,same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects: what can
1228,be more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a
1228,"sphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws"
1228,"of a beetle?--yet all these organs, serving for such different purposes,"
1228,"are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip,"
1228,"mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. Analogous laws govern the"
1228,construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans. So it is with the
1228,flowers of plants.
1228,
1228,Nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity
1228,"of pattern in members of the same class, by utility or by the doctrine"
1228,of final causes. The hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly
1228,admitted by Owen in his most interesting work on the 'Nature of Limbs.'
1228,"On the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can"
1228,only say that so it is;--that it has so pleased the Creator to construct
1228,each animal and plant.
1228,
1228,The explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of
1228,"successive slight modifications,--each modification being profitable"
1228,"in some way to the modified form, but often affecting by correlation of"
1228,"growth other parts of the organisation. In changes of this nature, there"
1228,"will be little or no tendency to modify the original pattern, or to"
1228,transpose parts. The bones of a limb might be shortened and widened to
1228,"any extent, and become gradually enveloped in thick membrane, so as to"
1228,"serve as a fin; or a webbed foot might have all its bones, or certain"
1228,"bones, lengthened to any extent, and the membrane connecting them"
1228,"increased to any extent, so as to serve as a wing: yet in all this great"
1228,amount of modification there will be no tendency to alter the framework
1228,of bones or the relative connexion of the several parts. If we suppose
1228,"that the ancient progenitor, the archetype as it may be called, of all"
1228,"mammals, had its limbs constructed on the existing general pattern,"
1228,"for whatever purpose they served, we can at once perceive the plain"
1228,signification of the homologous construction of the limbs throughout the
1228,"whole class. So with the mouths of insects, we have only to suppose that"
1228,"their common progenitor had an upper lip, mandibles, and two pair"
1228,"of maxillae, these parts being perhaps very simple in form; and then"
1228,natural selection will account for the infinite diversity in structure
1228,"and function of the mouths of insects. Nevertheless, it is conceivable"
1228,that the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to
1228,"be finally lost, by the atrophy and ultimately by the complete abortion"
1228,"of certain parts, by the soldering together of other parts, and by the"
1228,"doubling or multiplication of others,--variations which we know to be"
1228,within the limits of possibility. In the paddles of the extinct gigantic
1228,"sea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans, the"
1228,general pattern seems to have been thus to a certain extent obscured.
1228,
1228,There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject;
1228,"namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a"
1228,"class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual."
1228,Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous
1228,with--that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with--the
1228,elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and
1228,posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes
1228,are plainly homologous. We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully
1228,complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every
1228,"one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals,"
1228,"stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are"
1228,"intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves,"
1228,"arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence"
1228,of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we
1228,"can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and"
1228,"in flowers, that organs, which when mature become extremely different,"
1228,are at an early stage of growth exactly alike.
1228,
1228,How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! Why
1228,should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such
1228,"extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked, the"
1228,benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of
1228,"parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction"
1228,in the skulls of birds. Why should similar bones have been created in
1228,"the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such"
1228,"totally different purposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an"
1228,"extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have"
1228,"fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths?"
1228,"Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual"
1228,"flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all"
1228,constructed on the same pattern?
1228,
1228,"On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these"
1228,"questions. In the vertebrata, we see a series of internal vertebrae"
1228,"bearing certain processes and appendages; in the articulata, we see the"
1228,"body divided into a series of segments, bearing external appendages;"
1228,"and in flowering plants, we see a series of successive spiral whorls of"
1228,leaves. An indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common
1228,characteristic (as Owen has observed) of all low or little-modified
1228,forms; therefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor of
1228,the vertebrata possessed many vertebrae; the unknown progenitor of
1228,"the articulata, many segments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering"
1228,"plants, many spiral whorls of leaves. We have formerly seen that"
1228,parts many times repeated are eminently liable to vary in number and
1228,"structure; consequently it is quite probable that natural selection,"
1228,"during a long-continued course of modification, should have seized on"
1228,"a certain number of the primordially similar elements, many times"
1228,"repeated, and have adapted them to the most diverse purposes. And as"
1228,the whole amount of modification will have been effected by slight
1228,"successive steps, we need not wonder at discovering in such parts or"
1228,"organs, a certain degree of fundamental resemblance, retained by the"
1228,strong principle of inheritance.
1228,
1228,"In the great class of molluscs, though we can homologise the parts of"
1228,"one species with those of another and distinct species, we can indicate"
1228,"but few serial homologies; that is, we are seldom enabled to say that"
1228,one part or organ is homologous with another in the same individual. And
1228,"we can understand this fact; for in molluscs, even in the lowest members"
1228,"of the class, we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of"
1228,"any one part, as we find in the other great classes of the animal and"
1228,vegetable kingdoms.
1228,
1228,Naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed
1228,vertebrae: the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and
1228,pistils of flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in these cases
1228,"probably be more correct, as Professor Huxley has remarked, to speak"
1228,"of both skull and vertebrae, both jaws and legs, etc.,--as having been"
1228,"metamorphosed, not one from the other, but from some common element."
1228,"Naturalists, however, use such language only in a metaphorical sense:"
1228,"they are far from meaning that during a long course of descent,"
1228,primordial organs of any kind--vertebrae in the one case and legs in the
1228,other--have actually been modified into skulls or jaws. Yet so strong
1228,"is the appearance of a modification of this nature having occurred,"
1228,that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language having this plain
1228,signification. On my view these terms may be used literally; and the
1228,"wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab retaining numerous"
1228,"characters, which they would probably have retained through inheritance,"
1228,if they had really been metamorphosed during a long course of descent
1228,"from true legs, or from some simple appendage, is explained."
1228,
1228,EMBRYOLOGY.
1228,
1228,It has already been casually remarked that certain organs in the
1228,"individual, which when mature become widely different and serve for"
1228,"different purposes, are in the embryo exactly alike. The embryos, also,"
1228,of distinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar:
1228,"a better proof of this cannot be given, than a circumstance mentioned"
1228,"by Agassiz, namely, that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some"
1228,"vertebrate animal, he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal,"
1228,"bird, or reptile. The vermiform larvae of moths, flies, beetles, etc.,"
1228,resemble each other much more closely than do the mature insects; but
1228,"in the case of larvae, the embryos are active, and have been adapted"
1228,"for special lines of life. A trace of the law of embryonic resemblance,"
1228,"sometimes lasts till a rather late age: thus birds of the same genus,"
1228,"and of closely allied genera, often resemble each other in their first"
1228,and second plumage; as we see in the spotted feathers in the thrush
1228,"group. In the cat tribe, most of the species are striped or spotted"
1228,in lines; and stripes can be plainly distinguished in the whelp of
1228,the lion. We occasionally though rarely see something of this kind in
1228,"plants: thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or furze, and the first"
1228,"leaves of the phyllodineous acaceas, are pinnate or divided like the"
1228,ordinary leaves of the leguminosae.
1228,
1228,"The points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different"
1228,"animals of the same class resemble each other, often have no direct"
1228,"relation to their conditions of existence. We cannot, for instance,"
1228,suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like
1228,course of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar
1228,"conditions,--in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its"
1228,"mother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest, and in the"
1228,spawn of a frog under water. We have no more reason to believe in such
1228,"a relation, than we have to believe that the same bones in the hand of"
1228,"a man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise, are related to similar"
1228,conditions of life. No one will suppose that the stripes on the whelp
1228,"of a lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, are of any use to these"
1228,"animals, or are related to the conditions to which they are exposed."
1228,
1228,"The case, however, is different when an animal during any part of its"
1228,"embryonic career is active, and has to provide for itself. The period of"
1228,"activity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever it comes on,"
1228,the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfect
1228,"and as beautiful as in the adult animal. From such special adaptations,"
1228,the similarity of the larvae or active embryos of allied animals is
1228,sometimes much obscured; and cases could be given of the larvae of two
1228,"species, or of two groups of species, differing quite as much, or"
1228,"even more, from each other than do their adult parents. In most cases,"
1228,"however, the larvae, though active, still obey more or less closely the"
1228,law of common embryonic resemblance. Cirripedes afford a good instance
1228,of this: even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle
1228,"was, as it certainly is, a crustacean; but a glance at the larva shows"
1228,this to be the case in an unmistakeable manner. So again the two main
1228,"divisions of cirripedes, the pedunculated and sessile, which differ"
1228,"widely in external appearance, have larvae in all their several stages"
1228,barely distinguishable.
1228,
1228,The embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation:
1228,"I use this expression, though I am aware that it is hardly possible to"
1228,define clearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower.
1228,But no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the
1228,"caterpillar. In some cases, however, the mature animal is generally"
1228,"considered as lower in the scale than the larva, as with certain"
1228,parasitic crustaceans. To refer once again to cirripedes: the larvae in
1228,"the first stage have three pairs of legs, a very simple single eye, and"
1228,"a probosciformed mouth, with which they feed largely, for they increase"
1228,"much in size. In the second stage, answering to the chrysalis stage of"
1228,"butterflies, they have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatory"
1228,"legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes, and extremely complex"
1228,"antennae; but they have a closed and imperfect mouth, and cannot feed:"
1228,"their function at this stage is, to search by their well-developed"
1228,"organs of sense, and to reach by their active powers of swimming, a"
1228,proper place on which to become attached and to undergo their final
1228,metamorphosis. When this is completed they are fixed for life: their
1228,legs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again obtain a
1228,"well-constructed mouth; but they have no antennae, and their two eyes"
1228,"are now reconverted into a minute, single, and very simple eye-spot."
1228,"In this last and complete state, cirripedes may be considered as"
1228,either more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the larval
1228,condition. But in some genera the larvae become developed either into
1228,"hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or into what I have called"
1228,"complemental males: and in the latter, the development has assuredly"
1228,"been retrograde; for the male is a mere sack, which lives for a short"
1228,"time, and is destitute of mouth, stomach, or other organ of importance,"
1228,excepting for reproduction.
1228,
1228,We are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between the
1228,"embryo and the adult, and likewise a close similarity in the embryos of"
1228,"widely different animals within the same class, that we might be led to"
1228,look at these facts as necessarily contingent in some manner on growth.
1228,"But there is no obvious reason why, for instance, the wing of a bat, or"
1228,"the fin of a porpoise, should not have been sketched out with all the"
1228,"parts in proper proportion, as soon as any structure became visible in"
1228,the embryo. And in some whole groups of animals and in certain members
1228,"of other groups, the embryo does not at any period differ widely from"
1228,"the adult: thus Owen has remarked in regard to cuttle-fish, ""there is no"
1228,metamorphosis; the cephalopodic character is manifested long before
1228,"the parts of the embryo are completed;"" and again in spiders, ""there"
1228,"is nothing worthy to be called a metamorphosis."" The larvae of insects,"
1228,"whether adapted to the most diverse and active habits, or quite"
1228,"inactive, being fed by their parents or placed in the midst of proper"
1228,"nutriment, yet nearly all pass through a similar worm-like stage of"
1228,"development; but in some few cases, as in that of Aphis, if we look to"
1228,the admirable drawings by Professor Huxley of the development of this
1228,"insect, we see no trace of the vermiform stage."
1228,
1228,"How, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology,--namely"
1228,"the very general, but not universal difference in structure between the"
1228,"embryo and the adult;--of parts in the same individual embryo, which"
1228,"ultimately become very unlike and serve for diverse purposes, being"
1228,at this early period of growth alike;--of embryos of different species
1228,"within the same class, generally, but not universally, resembling each"
1228,other;--of the structure of the embryo not being closely related to its
1228,"conditions of existence, except when the embryo becomes at any period"
1228,of life active and has to provide for itself;--of the embryo apparently
1228,"having sometimes a higher organisation than the mature animal, into"
1228,"which it is developed. I believe that all these facts can be explained,"
1228,"as follows, on the view of descent with modification."
1228,
1228,"It is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities often affecting the"
1228,"embryo at a very early period, that slight variations necessarily"
1228,appear at an equally early period. But we have little evidence on
1228,this head--indeed the evidence rather points the other way; for it is
1228,"notorious that breeders of cattle, horses, and various fancy animals,"
1228,"cannot positively tell, until some time after the animal has been born,"
1228,what its merits or form will ultimately turn out. We see this plainly in
1228,our own children; we cannot always tell whether the child will be tall
1228,"or short, or what its precise features will be. The question is not, at"
1228,"what period of life any variation has been caused, but at what period"
1228,"it is fully displayed. The cause may have acted, and I believe generally"
1228,"has acted, even before the embryo is formed; and the variation may be"
1228,due to the male and female sexual elements having been affected by
1228,"the conditions to which either parent, or their ancestors, have been"
1228,"exposed. Nevertheless an effect thus caused at a very early period, even"
1228,"before the formation of the embryo, may appear late in life; as when"
1228,"an hereditary disease, which appears in old age alone, has been"
1228,communicated to the offspring from the reproductive element of one
1228,"parent. Or again, as when the horns of cross-bred cattle have been"
1228,affected by the shape of the horns of either parent. For the welfare of
1228,"a very young animal, as long as it remains in its mother's womb, or in"
1228,"the egg, or as long as it is nourished and protected by its parent,"
1228,it must be quite unimportant whether most of its characters are fully
1228,"acquired a little earlier or later in life. It would not signify, for"
1228,"instance, to a bird which obtained its food best by having a long beak,"
1228,"whether or not it assumed a beak of this particular length, as long as"
1228,"it was fed by its parents. Hence, I conclude, that it is quite possible,"
1228,"that each of the many successive modifications, by which each species"
1228,"has acquired its present structure, may have supervened at a not very"
1228,early period of life; and some direct evidence from our domestic animals
1228,supports this view. But in other cases it is quite possible that each
1228,"successive modification, or most of them, may have appeared at an"
1228,extremely early period.
1228,
1228,"I have stated in the first chapter, that there is some evidence to"
1228,"render it probable, that at whatever age any variation first appears"
1228,"in the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the"
1228,"offspring. Certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages, for"
1228,"instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states of"
1228,"the silk-moth; or, again, in the horns of almost full-grown cattle. But"
1228,"further than this, variations which, for all that we can see, might have"
1228,"appeared earlier or later in life, tend to appear at a corresponding"
1228,age in the offspring and parent. I am far from meaning that this is
1228,invariably the case; and I could give a good many cases of variations
1228,(taking the word in the largest sense) which have supervened at an
1228,earlier age in the child than in the parent.
1228,
1228,"These two principles, if their truth be admitted, will, I believe,"
1228,explain all the above specified leading facts in embryology. But first
1228,let us look at a few analogous cases in domestic varieties. Some authors
1228,"who have written on Dogs, maintain that the greyhound and bulldog,"
1228,"though appearing so different, are really varieties most closely allied,"
1228,and have probably descended from the same wild stock; hence I was
1228,curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other: I was
1228,"told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and"
1228,"this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually"
1228,"measuring the old dogs and their six-days old puppies, I found that"
1228,the puppies had not nearly acquired their full amount of proportional
1228,"difference. So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and race-horses"
1228,differed as much as the full-grown animals; and this surprised me
1228,"greatly, as I think it probable that the difference between these two"
1228,breeds has been wholly caused by selection under domestication; but
1228,having had careful measurements made of the dam and of a three-days old
1228,"colt of a race and heavy cart-horse, I find that the colts have by no"
1228,means acquired their full amount of proportional difference.
1228,
1228,"As the evidence appears to me conclusive, that the several domestic"
1228,"breeds of Pigeon have descended from one wild species, I compared young"
1228,"pigeons of various breeds, within twelve hours after being hatched; I"
1228,carefully measured the proportions (but will not here give details) of
1228,"the beak, width of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of"
1228,"feet and length of leg, in the wild stock, in pouters, fantails, runts,"
1228,"barbs, dragons, carriers, and tumblers. Now some of these birds, when"
1228,"mature, differ so extraordinarily in length and form of beak, that"
1228,"they would, I cannot doubt, be ranked in distinct genera, had they been"
1228,natural productions. But when the nestling birds of these several breeds
1228,"were placed in a row, though most of them could be distinguished from"
1228,"each other, yet their proportional differences in the above specified"
1228,several points were incomparably less than in the full-grown birds. Some
1228,"characteristic points of difference--for instance, that of the width"
1228,of mouth--could hardly be detected in the young. But there was one
1228,"remarkable exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced"
1228,tumbler differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon and of the other
1228,"breeds, in all its proportions, almost exactly as much as in the adult"
1228,state.
1228,
1228,The two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in
1228,regard to the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties. Fanciers
1228,"select their horses, dogs, and pigeons, for breeding, when they are"
1228,nearly grown up: they are indifferent whether the desired qualities
1228,"and structures have been acquired earlier or later in life, if the"
1228,"full-grown animal possesses them. And the cases just given, more"
1228,"especially that of pigeons, seem to show that the characteristic"
1228,"differences which give value to each breed, and which have been"
1228,"accumulated by man's selection, have not generally first appeared at"
1228,"an early period of life, and have been inherited by the offspring at a"
1228,"corresponding not early period. But the case of the short-faced tumbler,"
1228,"which when twelve hours old had acquired its proper proportions,"
1228,proves that this is not the universal rule; for here the characteristic
1228,"differences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual,"
1228,"or, if not so, the differences must have been inherited, not at the"
1228,"corresponding, but at an earlier age."
1228,
1228,"Now let us apply these facts and the above two principles--which latter,"
1228,"though not proved true, can be shown to be in some degree probable--to"
1228,"species in a state of nature. Let us take a genus of birds, descended"
1228,"on my theory from some one parent-species, and of which the several new"
1228,species have become modified through natural selection in accordance
1228,"with their diverse habits. Then, from the many slight successive steps"
1228,"of variation having supervened at a rather late age, and having been"
1228,"inherited at a corresponding age, the young of the new species of our"
1228,supposed genus will manifestly tend to resemble each other much more
1228,"closely than do the adults, just as we have seen in the case of"
1228,pigeons. We may extend this view to whole families or even classes. The
1228,"fore-limbs, for instance, which served as legs in the parent-species,"
1228,"may become, by a long course of modification, adapted in one descendant"
1228,"to act as hands, in another as paddles, in another as wings; and on the"
1228,above two principles--namely of each successive modification supervening
1228,"at a rather late age, and being inherited at a corresponding late"
1228,age--the fore-limbs in the embryos of the several descendants of the
1228,"parent-species will still resemble each other closely, for they will not"
1228,"have been modified. But in each individual new species, the embryonic"
1228,fore-limbs will differ greatly from the fore-limbs in the mature animal;
1228,the limbs in the latter having undergone much modification at a rather
1228,"late period of life, and having thus been converted into hands, or"
1228,"paddles, or wings. Whatever influence long-continued exercise or use on"
1228,"the one hand, and disuse on the other, may have in modifying an organ,"
1228,"such influence will mainly affect the mature animal, which has come"
1228,to its full powers of activity and has to gain its own living; and the
1228,effects thus produced will be inherited at a corresponding mature age.
1228,"Whereas the young will remain unmodified, or be modified in a lesser"
1228,"degree, by the effects of use and disuse."
1228,
1228,"In certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene, from"
1228,"causes of which we are wholly ignorant, at a very early period of life,"
1228,or each step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which
1228,it first appeared. In either case (as with the short-faced tumbler) the
1228,young or embryo would closely resemble the mature parent-form. We have
1228,seen that this is the rule of development in certain whole groups of
1228,"animals, as with cuttle-fish and spiders, and with a few members of the"
1228,"great class of insects, as with Aphis. With respect to the final cause"
1228,"of the young in these cases not undergoing any metamorphosis, or closely"
1228,"resembling their parents from their earliest age, we can see that this"
1228,"would result from the two following contingencies; firstly, from the"
1228,"young, during a course of modification carried on for many generations,"
1228,having to provide for their own wants at a very early stage of
1228,"development, and secondly, from their following exactly the same habits"
1228,"of life with their parents; for in this case, it would be indispensable"
1228,"for the existence of the species, that the child should be modified at"
1228,"a very early age in the same manner with its parents, in accordance with"
1228,"their similar habits. Some further explanation, however, of the embryo"
1228,"not undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite. If, on the other"
1228,"hand, it profited the young to follow habits of life in any degree"
1228,"different from those of their parent, and consequently to be constructed"
1228,"in a slightly different manner, then, on the principle of inheritance at"
1228,"corresponding ages, the active young or larvae might easily be rendered"
1228,by natural selection different to any conceivable extent from their
1228,"parents. Such differences might, also, become correlated with successive"
1228,"stages of development; so that the larvae, in the first stage, might"
1228,"differ greatly from the larvae in the second stage, as we have seen to"
1228,be the case with cirripedes. The adult might become fitted for sites or
1228,"habits, in which organs of locomotion or of the senses, etc., would be"
1228,useless; and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be
1228,retrograde.
1228,
1228,"As all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on"
1228,"this earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected"
1228,"by the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were"
1228,"nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical."
1228,Descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists
1228,have been seeking under the term of the natural system. On this view
1228,"we can understand how it is that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the"
1228,structure of the embryo is even more important for classification than
1228,that of the adult. For the embryo is the animal in its less modified
1228,state; and in so far it reveals the structure of its progenitor. In
1228,"two groups of animal, however much they may at present differ from each"
1228,"other in structure and habits, if they pass through the same or similar"
1228,"embryonic stages, we may feel assured that they have both descended from"
1228,"the same or nearly similar parents, and are therefore in that degree"
1228,"closely related. Thus, community in embryonic structure reveals"
1228,"community of descent. It will reveal this community of descent, however"
1228,much the structure of the adult may have been modified and obscured; we
1228,"have seen, for instance, that cirripedes can at once be recognised by"
1228,their larvae as belonging to the great class of crustaceans. As the
1228,embryonic state of each species and group of species partially shows us
1228,"the structure of their less modified ancient progenitors, we can clearly"
1228,see why ancient and extinct forms of life should resemble the embryos of
1228,"their descendants,--our existing species. Agassiz believes this to be a"
1228,law of nature; but I am bound to confess that I only hope to see the
1228,law hereafter proved true. It can be proved true in those cases alone in
1228,"which the ancient state, now supposed to be represented in many embryos,"
1228,"has not been obliterated, either by the successive variations in a long"
1228,"course of modification having supervened at a very early age, or by the"
1228,variations having been inherited at an earlier period than that at which
1228,"they first appeared. It should also be borne in mind, that the supposed"
1228,law of resemblance of ancient forms of life to the embryonic stages of
1228,"recent forms, may be true, but yet, owing to the geological record not"
1228,"extending far enough back in time, may remain for a long period, or for"
1228,"ever, incapable of demonstration."
1228,
1228,"Thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are"
1228,"second in importance to none in natural history, are explained on the"
1228,"principle of slight modifications not appearing, in the many descendants"
1228,"from some one ancient progenitor, at a very early period in the life of"
1228,"each, though perhaps caused at the earliest, and being inherited at a"
1228,"corresponding not early period. Embryology rises greatly in interest,"
1228,"when we thus look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of"
1228,the common parent-form of each great class of animals.
1228,
1228,"RUDIMENTARY, ATROPHIED, OR ABORTED ORGANS."
1228,
1228,"Organs or parts in this strange condition, bearing the stamp of"
1228,"inutility, are extremely common throughout nature. For instance,"
1228,rudimentary mammae are very general in the males of mammals: I presume
1228,"that the ""bastard-wing"" in birds may be safely considered as a digit"
1228,in a rudimentary state: in very many snakes one lobe of the lungs is
1228,rudimentary; in other snakes there are rudiments of the pelvis and hind
1228,limbs. Some of the cases of rudimentary organs are extremely curious;
1228,"for instance, the presence of teeth in foetal whales, which when grown"
1228,"up have not a tooth in their heads; and the presence of teeth, which"
1228,"never cut through the gums, in the upper jaws of our unborn calves. It"
1228,has even been stated on good authority that rudiments of teeth can be
1228,detected in the beaks of certain embryonic birds. Nothing can be plainer
1228,"than that wings are formed for flight, yet in how many insects do we see"
1228,"wings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight, and not"
1228,"rarely lying under wing-cases, firmly soldered together!"
1228,
1228,The meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable: for
1228,instance there are beetles of the same genus (and even of the same
1228,"species) resembling each other most closely in all respects, one"
1228,"of which will have full-sized wings, and another mere rudiments of"
1228,"membrane; and here it is impossible to doubt, that the rudiments"
1228,"represent wings. Rudimentary organs sometimes retain their potentiality,"
1228,and are merely not developed: this seems to be the case with the mammae
1228,"of male mammals, for many instances are on record of these organs having"
1228,"become well developed in full-grown males, and having secreted milk. So"
1228,again there are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats in
1228,"the udders of the genus Bos, but in our domestic cows the two sometimes"
1228,become developed and give milk. In individual plants of the same
1228,"species the petals sometimes occur as mere rudiments, and sometimes in"
1228,"a well-developed state. In plants with separated sexes, the male flowers"
1228,often have a rudiment of a pistil; and Kolreuter found that by crossing
1228,"such male plants with an hermaphrodite species, the rudiment of the"
1228,pistil in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size; and this
1228,shows that the rudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially alike in
1228,nature.
1228,
1228,"An organ serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly"
1228,"aborted for one, even the more important purpose; and remain perfectly"
1228,"efficient for the other. Thus in plants, the office of the pistil is to"
1228,allow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules protected in the ovarium at
1228,its base. The pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style; but in
1228,"some Compositae, the male florets, which of course cannot be fecundated,"
1228,"have a pistil, which is in a rudimentary state, for it is not crowned"
1228,"with a stigma; but the style remains well developed, and is clothed with"
1228,"hairs as in other compositae, for the purpose of brushing the pollen out"
1228,"of the surrounding anthers. Again, an organ may become rudimentary for"
1228,"its proper purpose, and be used for a distinct object: in certain fish"
1228,the swim-bladder seems to be rudimentary for its proper function of
1228,"giving buoyancy, but has become converted into a nascent breathing organ"
1228,or lung. Other similar instances could be given.
1228,
1228,Rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very
1228,"liable to vary in degree of development and in other respects. Moreover,"
1228,"in closely allied species, the degree to which the same organ has been"
1228,rendered rudimentary occasionally differs much. This latter fact is well
1228,exemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certain
1228,"groups. Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this implies,"
1228,"that we find in an animal or plant no trace of an organ, which analogy"
1228,"would lead us to expect to find, and which is occasionally found"
1228,in monstrous individuals of the species. Thus in the snapdragon
1228,(antirrhinum) we generally do not find a rudiment of a fifth stamen; but
1228,this may sometimes be seen. In tracing the homologies of the same
1228,"part in different members of a class, nothing is more common, or more"
1228,"necessary, than the use and discovery of rudiments. This is well shown"
1228,"in the drawings given by Owen of the bones of the leg of the horse, ox,"
1228,and rhinoceros.
1228,
1228,"It is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in the"
1228,"upper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the embryo,"
1228,"but afterwards wholly disappear. It is also, I believe, a universal"
1228,"rule, that a rudimentary part or organ is of greater size relatively to"
1228,"the adjoining parts in the embryo, than in the adult; so that the organ"
1228,"at this early age is less rudimentary, or even cannot be said to be in"
1228,"any degree rudimentary. Hence, also, a rudimentary organ in the adult,"
1228,is often said to have retained its embryonic condition.
1228,
1228,I have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs.
1228,"In reflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment: for"
1228,the same reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts and
1228,"organs are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal"
1228,"plainness that these rudimentary or atrophied organs, are imperfect and"
1228,useless. In works on natural history rudimentary organs are generally
1228,"said to have been created ""for the sake of symmetry,"" or in order ""to"
1228,"complete the scheme of nature;"" but this seems to me no explanation,"
1228,merely a restatement of the fact. Would it be thought sufficient to
1228,"say that because planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun,"
1228,"satellites follow the same course round the planets, for the sake of"
1228,"symmetry, and to complete the scheme of nature? An eminent physiologist"
1228,"accounts for the presence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they"
1228,"serve to excrete matter in excess, or injurious to the system; but can"
1228,"we suppose that the minute papilla, which often represents the pistil"
1228,"in male flowers, and which is formed merely of cellular tissue, can thus"
1228,act? Can we suppose that the formation of rudimentary teeth which are
1228,"subsequently absorbed, can be of any service to the rapidly growing"
1228,embryonic calf by the excretion of precious phosphate of lime? When a
1228,"man's fingers have been amputated, imperfect nails sometimes appear on"
1228,the stumps: I could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails have
1228,"appeared, not from unknown laws of growth, but in order to excrete horny"
1228,"matter, as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee were"
1228,formed for this purpose.
1228,
1228,"On my view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary"
1228,organs is simple. We have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our
1228,"domestic productions,--as the stump of a tail in tailless breeds,--the"
1228,"vestige of an ear in earless breeds,--the reappearance of minute"
1228,"dangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle, more especially, according"
1228,"to Youatt, in young animals,--and the state of the whole flower in the"
1228,cauliflower. We often see rudiments of various parts in monsters. But
1228,I doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin of
1228,"rudimentary organs in a state of nature, further than by showing that"
1228,rudiments can be produced; for I doubt whether species under nature ever
1228,undergo abrupt changes. I believe that disuse has been the main agency;
1228,that it has led in successive generations to the gradual reduction of
1228,"various organs, until they have become rudimentary,--as in the case of"
1228,"the eyes of animals inhabiting dark caverns, and of the wings of birds"
1228,"inhabiting oceanic islands, which have seldom been forced to take"
1228,"flight, and have ultimately lost the power of flying. Again, an organ"
1228,"useful under certain conditions, might become injurious under others,"
1228,as with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and in
1228,"this case natural selection would continue slowly to reduce the organ,"
1228,until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary.
1228,
1228,"Any change in function, which can be effected by insensibly small steps,"
1228,"is within the power of natural selection; so that an organ rendered,"
1228,"during changed habits of life, useless or injurious for one purpose,"
1228,might easily be modified and used for another purpose. Or an organ
1228,"might be retained for one alone of its former functions. An organ, when"
1228,"rendered useless, may well be variable, for its variations cannot be"
1228,checked by natural selection. At whatever period of life disuse or
1228,"selection reduces an organ, and this will generally be when the being"
1228,"has come to maturity and to its full powers of action, the principle"
1228,of inheritance at corresponding ages will reproduce the organ in its
1228,"reduced state at the same age, and consequently will seldom affect or"
1228,reduce it in the embryo. Thus we can understand the greater relative
1228,"size of rudimentary organs in the embryo, and their lesser relative size"
1228,in the adult. But if each step of the process of reduction were to
1228,"be inherited, not at the corresponding age, but at an extremely early"
1228,period of life (as we have good reason to believe to be possible) the
1228,"rudimentary part would tend to be wholly lost, and we should have a case"
1228,"of complete abortion. The principle, also, of economy, explained in a"
1228,"former chapter, by which the materials forming any part or structure, if"
1228,"not useful to the possessor, will be saved as far as is possible, will"
1228,probably often come into play; and this will tend to cause the entire
1228,obliteration of a rudimentary organ.
1228,
1228,As the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency
1228,"in every part of the organisation, which has long existed, to"
1228,"be inherited--we can understand, on the genealogical view of"
1228,"classification, how it is that systematists have found rudimentary"
1228,"parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high"
1228,physiological importance. Rudimentary organs may be compared with the
1228,"letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless"
1228,"in the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue in seeking for its"
1228,"derivation. On the view of descent with modification, we may conclude"
1228,"that the existence of organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and useless"
1228,"condition, or quite aborted, far from presenting a strange difficulty,"
1228,"as they assuredly do on the ordinary doctrine of creation, might"
1228,"even have been anticipated, and can be accounted for by the laws of"
1228,inheritance.
1228,
1228,SUMMARY.
1228,
1228,"In this chapter I have attempted to show, that the subordination of"
1228,group to group in all organisms throughout all time; that the nature of
1228,"the relationship, by which all living and extinct beings are united by"
1228,"complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one"
1228,grand system; the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by
1228,"naturalists in their classifications; the value set upon characters, if"
1228,"constant and prevalent, whether of high vital importance, or of the most"
1228,"trifling importance, or, as in rudimentary organs, of no importance; the"
1228,"wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters, and"
1228,characters of true affinity; and other such rules;--all naturally follow
1228,on the view of the common parentage of those forms which are considered
1228,"by naturalists as allied, together with their modification through"
1228,"natural selection, with its contingencies of extinction and divergence"
1228,"of character. In considering this view of classification, it should be"
1228,borne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used in
1228,"ranking together the sexes, ages, and acknowledged varieties of the same"
1228,"species, however different they may be in structure. If we extend the"
1228,"use of this element of descent,--the only certainly known cause of"
1228,"similarity in organic beings,--we shall understand what is meant by the"
1228,"natural system: it is genealogical in its attempted arrangement,"
1228,"with the grades of acquired difference marked by the terms varieties,"
1228,"species, genera, families, orders, and classes."
1228,
1228,"On this same view of descent with modification, all the great facts in"
1228,"Morphology become intelligible,--whether we look to the same pattern"
1228,"displayed in the homologous organs, to whatever purpose applied, of the"
1228,different species of a class; or to the homologous parts constructed on
1228,the same pattern in each individual animal and plant.
1228,
1228,"On the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily"
1228,"or generally supervening at a very early period of life, and being"
1228,"inherited at a corresponding period, we can understand the great leading"
1228,"facts in Embryology; namely, the resemblance in an individual embryo of"
1228,"the homologous parts, which when matured will become widely different"
1228,from each other in structure and function; and the resemblance in
1228,"different species of a class of the homologous parts or organs, though"
1228,fitted in the adult members for purposes as different as possible.
1228,"Larvae are active embryos, which have become specially modified in"
1228,"relation to their habits of life, through the principle of modifications"
1228,being inherited at corresponding ages. On this same principle--and
1228,"bearing in mind, that when organs are reduced in size, either from"
1228,"disuse or selection, it will generally be at that period of life when"
1228,"the being has to provide for its own wants, and bearing in mind how"
1228,strong is the principle of inheritance--the occurrence of rudimentary
1228,"organs and their final abortion, present to us no inexplicable"
1228,"difficulties; on the contrary, their presence might have been even"
1228,anticipated. The importance of embryological characters and of
1228,"rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible, on the view that"
1228,an arrangement is only so far natural as it is genealogical.
1228,
1228,"Finally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in"
1228,"this chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable"
1228,"species, genera, and families of organic beings, with which this world"
1228,"is peopled, have all descended, each within its own class or group, from"
1228,"common parents, and have all been modified in the course of descent,"
1228,"that I should without hesitation adopt this view, even if it were"
1228,unsupported by other facts or arguments.

1228,Recapitulation of the general and special circumstances in its favour.
1228,Causes of the general belief in the immutability of species. How far the
1228,theory of natural selection may be extended. Effects of its adoption on
1228,the study of Natural history. Concluding remarks.
1228,
1228,"As this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the"
1228,reader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated.
1228,
1228,That many and grave objections may be advanced against the theory of
1228,"descent with modification through natural selection, I do not deny. I"
1228,have endeavoured to give to them their full force. Nothing at first can
1228,appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and
1228,"instincts should have been perfected, not by means superior to, though"
1228,"analogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable"
1228,"slight variations, each good for the individual possessor. Nevertheless,"
1228,"this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination insuperably great,"
1228,"cannot be considered real if we admit the following propositions,"
1228,"namely,--that gradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct,"
1228,"which we may consider, either do now exist or could have existed, each"
1228,"good of its kind,--that all organs and instincts are, in ever so slight"
1228,"a degree, variable,--and, lastly, that there is a struggle for existence"
1228,leading to the preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or
1228,"instinct. The truth of these propositions cannot, I think, be disputed."
1228,
1228,"It is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what"
1228,"gradations many structures have been perfected, more especially amongst"
1228,broken and failing groups of organic beings; but we see so many strange
1228,"gradations in nature, as is proclaimed by the canon, ""Natura non facit"
1228,"saltum,"" that we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ"
1228,"or instinct, or any whole being, could not have arrived at its present"
1228,"state by many graduated steps. There are, it must be admitted, cases of"
1228,special difficulty on the theory of natural selection; and one of the
1228,most curious of these is the existence of two or three defined castes
1228,of workers or sterile females in the same community of ants; but I have
1228,attempted to show how this difficulty can be mastered.
1228,
1228,With respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first
1228,"crossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal"
1228,"fertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer the reader to the"
1228,"recapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter,"
1228,which seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more
1228,a special endowment than is the incapacity of two trees to be grafted
1228,"together, but that it is incidental on constitutional differences in the"
1228,reproductive systems of the intercrossed species. We see the truth of
1228,"this conclusion in the vast difference in the result, when the same two"
1228,"species are crossed reciprocally; that is, when one species is first"
1228,used as the father and then as the mother.
1228,
1228,The fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongrel
1228,offspring cannot be considered as universal; nor is their very general
1228,fertility surprising when we remember that it is not likely that either
1228,their constitutions or their reproductive systems should have been
1228,"profoundly modified. Moreover, most of the varieties which have been"
1228,experimentised on have been produced under domestication; and as
1228,"domestication apparently tends to eliminate sterility, we ought not to"
1228,expect it also to produce sterility.
1228,
1228,The sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first
1228,"crosses, for their reproductive organs are more or less functionally"
1228,impotent; whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in a
1228,perfect condition. As we continually see that organisms of all kinds
1228,are rendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having been
1228,"disturbed by slightly different and new conditions of life, we need"
1228,"not feel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile, for their"
1228,constitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being
1228,compounded of two distinct organisations. This parallelism is supported
1228,"by another parallel, but directly opposite, class of facts; namely, that"
1228,the vigour and fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight
1228,"changes in their conditions of life, and that the offspring of slightly"
1228,modified forms or varieties acquire from being crossed increased vigour
1228,"and fertility. So that, on the one hand, considerable changes in the"
1228,"conditions of life and crosses between greatly modified forms, lessen"
1228,"fertility; and on the other hand, lesser changes in the conditions of"
1228,"life and crosses between less modified forms, increase fertility."
1228,
1228,"Turning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered"
1228,on the theory of descent with modification are grave enough. All the
1228,"individuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus,"
1228,"or even higher group, must have descended from common parents; and"
1228,"therefore, in however distant and isolated parts of the world they are"
1228,"now found, they must in the course of successive generations have passed"
1228,from some one part to the others. We are often wholly unable even to
1228,"conjecture how this could have been effected. Yet, as we have reason to"
1228,believe that some species have retained the same specific form for very
1228,"long periods, enormously long as measured by years, too much stress"
1228,ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the same
1228,species; for during very long periods of time there will always be a
1228,good chance for wide migration by many means. A broken or interrupted
1228,range may often be accounted for by the extinction of the species in
1228,the intermediate regions. It cannot be denied that we are as yet very
1228,ignorant of the full extent of the various climatal and geographical
1228,changes which have affected the earth during modern periods; and
1228,such changes will obviously have greatly facilitated migration. As an
1228,"example, I have attempted to show how potent has been the influence"
1228,of the Glacial period on the distribution both of the same and of
1228,representative species throughout the world. We are as yet profoundly
1228,ignorant of the many occasional means of transport. With respect to
1228,distinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated
1228,"regions, as the process of modification has necessarily been slow,"
1228,all the means of migration will have been possible during a very long
1228,period; and consequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of species
1228,of the same genus is in some degree lessened.
1228,
1228,As on the theory of natural selection an interminable number of
1228,"intermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the species"
1228,"in each group by gradations as fine as our present varieties, it may be"
1228,"asked, Why do we not see these linking forms all around us? Why are"
1228,not all organic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos? With
1228,"respect to existing forms, we should remember that we have no right to"
1228,expect (excepting in rare cases) to discover DIRECTLY connecting links
1228,"between them, but only between each and some extinct and supplanted"
1228,"form. Even on a wide area, which has during a long period remained"
1228,"continuous, and of which the climate and other conditions of life change"
1228,insensibly in going from a district occupied by one species into another
1228,"district occupied by a closely allied species, we have no just right to"
1228,expect often to find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zone.
1228,For we have reason to believe that only a few species are undergoing
1228,change at any one period; and all changes are slowly effected. I have
1228,also shown that the intermediate varieties which will at first probably
1228,"exist in the intermediate zones, will be liable to be supplanted by the"
1228,"allied forms on either hand; and the latter, from existing in greater"
1228,"numbers, will generally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than"
1228,"the intermediate varieties, which exist in lesser numbers; so that"
1228,"the intermediate varieties will, in the long run, be supplanted and"
1228,exterminated.
1228,
1228,On this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting
1228,"links, between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world, and at"
1228,"each successive period between the extinct and still older species, why"
1228,is not every geological formation charged with such links? Why does
1228,not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the
1228,gradation and mutation of the forms of life? We meet with no such
1228,"evidence, and this is the most obvious and forcible of the many"
1228,"objections which may be urged against my theory. Why, again, do whole"
1228,"groups of allied species appear, though certainly they often falsely"
1228,"appear, to have come in suddenly on the several geological stages? Why"
1228,"do we not find great piles of strata beneath the Silurian system, stored"
1228,with the remains of the progenitors of the Silurian groups of fossils?
1228,For certainly on my theory such strata must somewhere have been
1228,deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs in the world's
1228,history.
1228,
1228,I can answer these questions and grave objections only on the
1228,supposition that the geological record is far more imperfect than most
1228,geologists believe. It cannot be objected that there has not been time
1228,sufficient for any amount of organic change; for the lapse of time has
1228,been so great as to be utterly inappreciable by the human intellect. The
1228,number of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as nothing compared
1228,with the countless generations of countless species which certainly have
1228,existed. We should not be able to recognise a species as the parent
1228,"of any one or more species if we were to examine them ever so closely,"
1228,unless we likewise possessed many of the intermediate links between
1228,their past or parent and present states; and these many links we
1228,"could hardly ever expect to discover, owing to the imperfection of the"
1228,geological record. Numerous existing doubtful forms could be named which
1228,are probably varieties; but who will pretend that in future ages so
1228,"many fossil links will be discovered, that naturalists will be able"
1228,"to decide, on the common view, whether or not these doubtful forms are"
1228,varieties? As long as most of the links between any two species are
1228,"unknown, if any one link or intermediate variety be discovered, it will"
1228,simply be classed as another and distinct species. Only a small portion
1228,of the world has been geologically explored. Only organic beings of
1228,"certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition, at least in any"
1228,"great number. Widely ranging species vary most, and varieties are often"
1228,"at first local,--both causes rendering the discovery of intermediate"
1228,links less likely. Local varieties will not spread into other and
1228,distant regions until they are considerably modified and improved; and
1228,"when they do spread, if discovered in a geological formation, they will"
1228,"appear as if suddenly created there, and will be simply classed as new"
1228,species. Most formations have been intermittent in their accumulation;
1228,"and their duration, I am inclined to believe, has been shorter than the"
1228,average duration of specific forms. Successive formations are separated
1228,from each other by enormous blank intervals of time; for fossiliferous
1228,"formations, thick enough to resist future degradation, can be"
1228,accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed
1228,of the sea. During the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary
1228,level the record will be blank. During these latter periods there will
1228,probably be more variability in the forms of life; during periods of
1228,"subsidence, more extinction."
1228,
1228,With respect to the absence of fossiliferous formations beneath the
1228,"lowest Silurian strata, I can only recur to the hypothesis given in the"
1228,ninth chapter. That the geological record is imperfect all will admit;
1228,"but that it is imperfect to the degree which I require, few will be"
1228,"inclined to admit. If we look to long enough intervals of time, geology"
1228,plainly declares that all species have changed; and they have changed in
1228,"the manner which my theory requires, for they have changed slowly and"
1228,in a graduated manner. We clearly see this in the fossil remains from
1228,consecutive formations invariably being much more closely related to
1228,"each other, than are the fossils from formations distant from each other"
1228,in time.
1228,
1228,Such is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties
1228,which may justly be urged against my theory; and I have now briefly
1228,recapitulated the answers and explanations which can be given to them. I
1228,have felt these difficulties far too heavily during many years to doubt
1228,their weight. But it deserves especial notice that the more important
1228,objections relate to questions on which we are confessedly ignorant;
1228,nor do we know how ignorant we are. We do not know all the possible
1228,transitional gradations between the simplest and the most perfect
1228,organs; it cannot be pretended that we know all the varied means
1228,"of Distribution during the long lapse of years, or that we know how"
1228,imperfect the Geological Record is. Grave as these several difficulties
1228,"are, in my judgment they do not overthrow the theory of descent with"
1228,modification.
1228,
1228,Now let us turn to the other side of the argument. Under domestication
1228,we see much variability. This seems to be mainly due to the reproductive
1228,system being eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life;
1228,"so that this system, when not rendered impotent, fails to reproduce"
1228,offspring exactly like the parent-form. Variability is governed by many
1228,"complex laws,--by correlation of growth, by use and disuse, and by"
1228,the direct action of the physical conditions of life. There is
1228,much difficulty in ascertaining how much modification our domestic
1228,productions have undergone; but we may safely infer that the amount has
1228,"been large, and that modifications can be inherited for long periods."
1228,"As long as the conditions of life remain the same, we have reason to"
1228,"believe that a modification, which has already been inherited for many"
1228,"generations, may continue to be inherited for an almost infinite number"
1228,"of generations. On the other hand we have evidence that variability,"
1228,"when it has once come into play, does not wholly cease; for new"
1228,varieties are still occasionally produced by our most anciently
1228,domesticated productions.
1228,
1228,Man does not actually produce variability; he only unintentionally
1228,"exposes organic beings to new conditions of life, and then nature acts"
1228,"on the organisation, and causes variability. But man can and does select"
1228,"the variations given to him by nature, and thus accumulate them in any"
1228,desired manner. He thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or
1228,"pleasure. He may do this methodically, or he may do it unconsciously by"
1228,"preserving the individuals most useful to him at the time, without"
1228,any thought of altering the breed. It is certain that he can largely
1228,"influence the character of a breed by selecting, in each successive"
1228,"generation, individual differences so slight as to be quite"
1228,inappreciable by an uneducated eye. This process of selection has been
1228,the great agency in the production of the most distinct and useful
1228,domestic breeds. That many of the breeds produced by man have to a large
1228,"extent the character of natural species, is shown by the inextricable"
1228,doubts whether very many of them are varieties or aboriginal species.
1228,
1228,There is no obvious reason why the principles which have acted so
1228,efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature.
1228,"In the preservation of favoured individuals and races, during the"
1228,"constantly-recurrent Struggle for Existence, we see the most powerful"
1228,and ever-acting means of selection. The struggle for existence
1228,inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of increase which is
1228,common to all organic beings. This high rate of increase is proved by
1228,"calculation, by the effects of a succession of peculiar seasons, and by"
1228,"the results of naturalisation, as explained in the third chapter. More"
1228,individuals are born than can possibly survive. A grain in the balance
1228,"will determine which individual shall live and which shall die,--which"
1228,"variety or species shall increase in number, and which shall decrease,"
1228,or finally become extinct. As the individuals of the same species
1228,"come in all respects into the closest competition with each other, the"
1228,struggle will generally be most severe between them; it will be almost
1228,"equally severe between the varieties of the same species, and next in"
1228,severity between the species of the same genus. But the struggle will
1228,often be very severe between beings most remote in the scale of nature.
1228,"The slightest advantage in one being, at any age or during any season,"
1228,"over those with which it comes into competition, or better adaptation"
1228,"in however slight a degree to the surrounding physical conditions, will"
1228,turn the balance.
1228,
1228,With animals having separated sexes there will in most cases be a
1228,struggle between the males for possession of the females. The most
1228,"vigorous individuals, or those which have most successfully struggled"
1228,"with their conditions of life, will generally leave most progeny. But"
1228,"success will often depend on having special weapons or means of defence,"
1228,or on the charms of the males; and the slightest advantage will lead to
1228,victory.
1228,
1228,As geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical
1228,"changes, we might have expected that organic beings would have varied"
1228,"under nature, in the same way as they generally have varied under the"
1228,changed conditions of domestication. And if there be any variability
1228,"under nature, it would be an unaccountable fact if natural selection"
1228,"had not come into play. It has often been asserted, but the assertion is"
1228,"quite incapable of proof, that the amount of variation under nature is"
1228,"a strictly limited quantity. Man, though acting on external characters"
1228,"alone and often capriciously, can produce within a short period a"
1228,great result by adding up mere individual differences in his domestic
1228,productions; and every one admits that there are at least individual
1228,"differences in species under nature. But, besides such differences, all"
1228,"naturalists have admitted the existence of varieties, which they think"
1228,sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record in systematic works. No one
1228,can draw any clear distinction between individual differences and slight
1228,"varieties; or between more plainly marked varieties and sub-species,"
1228,and species. Let it be observed how naturalists differ in the rank
1228,which they assign to the many representative forms in Europe and North
1228,America.
1228,
1228,If then we have under nature variability and a powerful agent always
1228,"ready to act and select, why should we doubt that variations in any way"
1228,"useful to beings, under their excessively complex relations of life,"
1228,"would be preserved, accumulated, and inherited? Why, if man can by"
1228,"patience select variations most useful to himself, should nature fail in"
1228,"selecting variations useful, under changing conditions of life, to her"
1228,"living products? What limit can be put to this power, acting during long"
1228,"ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole constitution, structure, and"
1228,"habits of each creature,--favouring the good and rejecting the bad? I"
1228,"can see no limit to this power, in slowly and beautifully adapting"
1228,each form to the most complex relations of life. The theory of natural
1228,"selection, even if we looked no further than this, seems to me to be in"
1228,"itself probable. I have already recapitulated, as fairly as I could,"
1228,the opposed difficulties and objections: now let us turn to the special
1228,facts and arguments in favour of the theory.
1228,
1228,On the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent
1228,"varieties, and that each species first existed as a variety, we can"
1228,"see why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species,"
1228,"commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation,"
1228,and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary
1228,laws. On this same view we can understand how it is that in each region
1228,"where many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now"
1228,"flourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where"
1228,"the manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a"
1228,"general rule, to find it still in action; and this is the case if"
1228,"varieties be incipient species. Moreover, the species of the larger"
1228,"genera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient"
1228,"species, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties; for"
1228,they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the
1228,species of smaller genera. The closely allied species also of the larger
1228,"genera apparently have restricted ranges, and they are clustered in"
1228,little groups round other species--in which respects they resemble
1228,varieties. These are strange relations on the view of each species
1228,"having been independently created, but are intelligible if all species"
1228,first existed as varieties.
1228,
1228,As each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction to
1228,increase inordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of each
1228,species will be enabled to increase by so much the more as they become
1228,"more diversified in habits and structure, so as to be enabled to seize"
1228,"on many and widely different places in the economy of nature, there"
1228,will be a constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most
1228,divergent offspring of any one species. Hence during a long-continued
1228,"course of modification, the slight differences, characteristic of"
1228,"varieties of the same species, tend to be augmented into the greater"
1228,differences characteristic of species of the same genus. New and
1228,"improved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older,"
1228,less improved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered
1228,to a large extent defined and distinct objects. Dominant species
1228,belonging to the larger groups tend to give birth to new and dominant
1228,"forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger, and at"
1228,the same time more divergent in character. But as all groups cannot thus
1228,"succeed in increasing in size, for the world would not hold them, the"
1228,more dominant groups beat the less dominant. This tendency in the large
1228,"groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character, together"
1228,"with the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction, explains the"
1228,"arrangement of all the forms of life, in groups subordinate to groups,"
1228,"all within a few great classes, which we now see everywhere around us,"
1228,and which has prevailed throughout all time. This grand fact of the
1228,grouping of all organic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on the
1228,theory of creation.
1228,
1228,"As natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive,"
1228,"favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification;"
1228,"it can act only by very short and slow steps. Hence the canon of ""Natura"
1228,"non facit saltum,"" which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to"
1228,"make more strictly correct, is on this theory simply intelligible. We"
1228,"can plainly see why nature is prodigal in variety, though niggard in"
1228,innovation. But why this should be a law of nature if each species has
1228,"been independently created, no man can explain."
1228,
1228,"Many other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. How"
1228,"strange it is that a bird, under the form of woodpecker, should have"
1228,"been created to prey on insects on the ground; that upland geese, which"
1228,"never or rarely swim, should have been created with webbed feet; that a"
1228,thrush should have been created to dive and feed on sub-aquatic insects;
1228,and that a petrel should have been created with habits and structure
1228,fitting it for the life of an auk or grebe! and so on in endless other
1228,cases. But on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in
1228,"number, with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying"
1228,"descendants of each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature,"
1228,"these facts cease to be strange, or perhaps might even have been"
1228,anticipated.
1228,
1228,"As natural selection acts by competition, it adapts the inhabitants"
1228,of each country only in relation to the degree of perfection of their
1228,associates; so that we need feel no surprise at the inhabitants of
1228,"any one country, although on the ordinary view supposed to have been"
1228,"specially created and adapted for that country, being beaten and"
1228,supplanted by the naturalised productions from another land. Nor ought
1228,"we to marvel if all the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can"
1228,"judge, absolutely perfect; and if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas"
1228,of fitness. We need not marvel at the sting of the bee causing the bee's
1228,own death; at drones being produced in such vast numbers for one
1228,"single act, and being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the"
1228,astonishing waste of pollen by our fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred
1228,of the queen bee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidae feeding
1228,within the live bodies of caterpillars; and at other such cases. The
1228,"wonder indeed is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of"
1228,the want of absolute perfection have not been observed.
1228,
1228,"The complex and little known laws governing variation are the same, as"
1228,"far as we can see, with the laws which have governed the production of"
1228,so-called specific forms. In both cases physical conditions seem to have
1228,"produced but little direct effect; yet when varieties enter any zone,"
1228,they occasionally assume some of the characters of the species proper
1228,"to that zone. In both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have"
1228,produced some effect; for it is difficult to resist this conclusion
1228,"when we look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which has wings"
1228,"incapable of flight, in nearly the same condition as in the domestic"
1228,"duck; or when we look at the burrowing tucutucu, which is occasionally"
1228,"blind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually blind and have"
1228,their eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the blind animals
1228,inhabiting the dark caves of America and Europe. In both varieties and
1228,species correlation of growth seems to have played a most important
1228,"part, so that when one part has been modified other parts are"
1228,necessarily modified. In both varieties and species reversions to
1228,long-lost characters occur. How inexplicable on the theory of creation
1228,is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder and legs of the
1228,several species of the horse-genus and in their hybrids! How simply is
1228,this fact explained if we believe that these species have descended from
1228,"a striped progenitor, in the same manner as the several domestic breeds"
1228,of pigeon have descended from the blue and barred rock-pigeon!
1228,
1228,"On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,"
1228,"why should the specific characters, or those by which the species of"
1228,"the same genus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic"
1228,"characters in which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the colour"
1228,"of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if"
1228,"the other species, supposed to have been created independently, have"
1228,"differently coloured flowers, than if all the species of the genus have"
1228,"the same coloured flowers? If species are only well-marked varieties,"
1228,"of which the characters have become in a high degree permanent, we can"
1228,understand this fact; for they have already varied since they branched
1228,"off from a common progenitor in certain characters, by which they have"
1228,come to be specifically distinct from each other; and therefore these
1228,same characters would be more likely still to be variable than the
1228,generic characters which have been inherited without change for an
1228,enormous period. It is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part
1228,"developed in a very unusual manner in any one species of a genus,"
1228,"and therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great importance to the"
1228,"species, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on my view, this"
1228,"part has undergone, since the several species branched off from a common"
1228,"progenitor, an unusual amount of variability and modification, and"
1228,therefore we might expect this part generally to be still variable. But
1228,"a part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like the wing of a"
1228,"bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the part"
1228,"be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been inherited"
1228,for a very long period; for in this case it will have been rendered
1228,constant by long-continued natural selection.
1228,
1228,"Glancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater"
1228,difficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the natural
1228,"selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. We"
1228,can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing
1228,different animals of the same class with their several instincts. I have
1228,attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws
1228,on the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt
1228,sometimes comes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is
1228,"not indispensable, as we see, in the case of neuter insects, which leave"
1228,no progeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. On the view
1228,of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common
1228,"parent, and having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is"
1228,"that allied species, when placed under considerably different conditions"
1228,"of life, yet should follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrush of"
1228,"South America, for instance, lines her nest with mud like our British"
1228,species. On the view of instincts having been slowly acquired through
1228,natural selection we need not marvel at some instincts being apparently
1228,"not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many instincts causing other"
1228,animals to suffer.
1228,
1228,"If species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can at once"
1228,see why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws
1228,"in their degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents,--in being"
1228,"absorbed into each other by successive crosses, and in other such"
1228,"points,--as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. On"
1228,"the other hand, these would be strange facts if species have been"
1228,"independently created, and varieties have been produced by secondary"
1228,laws.
1228,
1228,If we admit that the geological record is imperfect in an extreme
1228,"degree, then such facts as the record gives, support the theory of"
1228,descent with modification. New species have come on the stage slowly and
1228,"at successive intervals; and the amount of change, after equal intervals"
1228,"of time, is widely different in different groups. The extinction of"
1228,"species and of whole groups of species, which has played so conspicuous"
1228,"a part in the history of the organic world, almost inevitably follows on"
1228,the principle of natural selection; for old forms will be supplanted
1228,by new and improved forms. Neither single species nor groups of species
1228,reappear when the chain of ordinary generation has once been broken. The
1228,"gradual diffusion of dominant forms, with the slow modification of their"
1228,"descendants, causes the forms of life, after long intervals of time, to"
1228,appear as if they had changed simultaneously throughout the world.
1228,The fact of the fossil remains of each formation being in some degree
1228,intermediate in character between the fossils in the formations above
1228,"and below, is simply explained by their intermediate position in the"
1228,chain of descent. The grand fact that all extinct organic beings belong
1228,"to the same system with recent beings, falling either into the same or"
1228,"into intermediate groups, follows from the living and the extinct being"
1228,the offspring of common parents. As the groups which have descended
1228,"from an ancient progenitor have generally diverged in character, the"
1228,progenitor with its early descendants will often be intermediate in
1228,character in comparison with its later descendants; and thus we can see
1228,"why the more ancient a fossil is, the oftener it stands in some degree"
1228,intermediate between existing and allied groups. Recent forms are
1228,"generally looked at as being, in some vague sense, higher than ancient"
1228,and extinct forms; and they are in so far higher as the later and more
1228,improved forms have conquered the older and less improved organic beings
1228,"in the struggle for life. Lastly, the law of the long endurance of"
1228,"allied forms on the same continent,--of marsupials in Australia, of"
1228,"edentata in America, and other such cases,--is intelligible, for within"
1228,"a confined country, the recent and the extinct will naturally be allied"
1228,by descent.
1228,
1228,"Looking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been"
1228,during the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world
1228,"to another, owing to former climatal and geographical changes and to the"
1228,"many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can understand,"
1228,"on the theory of descent with modification, most of the great leading"
1228,facts in Distribution. We can see why there should be so striking a
1228,"parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout space, and"
1228,in their geological succession throughout time; for in both cases the
1228,"beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation, and the"
1228,means of modification have been the same. We see the full meaning of the
1228,"wonderful fact, which must have struck every traveller, namely, that on"
1228,"the same continent, under the most diverse conditions, under heat and"
1228,"cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of the"
1228,inhabitants within each great class are plainly related; for they will
1228,generally be descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists.
1228,"On this same principle of former migration, combined in most cases with"
1228,"modification, we can understand, by the aid of the Glacial period, the"
1228,"identity of some few plants, and the close alliance of many others,"
1228,"on the most distant mountains, under the most different climates; and"
1228,likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea in
1228,"the northern and southern temperate zones, though separated by the whole"
1228,intertropical ocean. Although two areas may present the same physical
1228,"conditions of life, we need feel no surprise at their inhabitants"
1228,"being widely different, if they have been for a long period completely"
1228,separated from each other; for as the relation of organism to organism
1228,"is the most important of all relations, and as the two areas will have"
1228,"received colonists from some third source or from each other, at various"
1228,"periods and in different proportions, the course of modification in the"
1228,two areas will inevitably be different.
1228,
1228,"On this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we can see why"
1228,"oceanic islands should be inhabited by few species, but of these, that"
1228,many should be peculiar. We can clearly see why those animals which
1228,"cannot cross wide spaces of ocean, as frogs and terrestrial mammals,"
1228,"should not inhabit oceanic islands; and why, on the other hand, new and"
1228,"peculiar species of bats, which can traverse the ocean, should so often"
1228,be found on islands far distant from any continent. Such facts as the
1228,"presence of peculiar species of bats, and the absence of all other"
1228,"mammals, on oceanic islands, are utterly inexplicable on the theory of"
1228,independent acts of creation.
1228,
1228,The existence of closely allied or representative species in any two
1228,"areas, implies, on the theory of descent with modification, that the"
1228,same parents formerly inhabited both areas; and we almost invariably
1228,"find that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas, some"
1228,identical species common to both still exist. Wherever many closely
1228,"allied yet distinct species occur, many doubtful forms and varieties of"
1228,the same species likewise occur. It is a rule of high generality that
1228,the inhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the
1228,nearest source whence immigrants might have been derived. We see this in
1228,"nearly all the plants and animals of the Galapagos archipelago, of Juan"
1228,"Fernandez, and of the other American islands being related in the most"
1228,striking manner to the plants and animals of the neighbouring American
1228,mainland; and those of the Cape de Verde archipelago and other African
1228,islands to the African mainland. It must be admitted that these facts
1228,receive no explanation on the theory of creation.
1228,
1228,"The fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings"
1228,"constitute one grand natural system, with group subordinate to group,"
1228,"and with extinct groups often falling in between recent groups, is"
1228,intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its contingencies
1228,of extinction and divergence of character. On these same principles
1228,"we see how it is, that the mutual affinities of the species and genera"
1228,within each class are so complex and circuitous. We see why certain
1228,characters are far more serviceable than others for classification;--why
1228,"adaptive characters, though of paramount importance to the being, are"
1228,of hardly any importance in classification; why characters derived from
1228,"rudimentary parts, though of no service to the being, are often of high"
1228,classificatory value; and why embryological characters are the most
1228,valuable of all. The real affinities of all organic beings are due
1228,to inheritance or community of descent. The natural system is a
1228,"genealogical arrangement, in which we have to discover the lines of"
1228,"descent by the most permanent characters, however slight their vital"
1228,importance may be.
1228,
1228,"The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of"
1228,"a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse,--the same number of"
1228,"vertebrae forming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant,--and"
1228,"innumerable other such facts, at once explain themselves on the theory"
1228,of descent with slow and slight successive modifications. The similarity
1228,"of pattern in the wing and leg of a bat, though used for such different"
1228,"purpose,--in the jaws and legs of a crab,--in the petals, stamens, and"
1228,"pistils of a flower, is likewise intelligible on the view of the"
1228,"gradual modification of parts or organs, which were alike in the early"
1228,progenitor of each class. On the principle of successive variations
1228,"not always supervening at an early age, and being inherited at a"
1228,"corresponding not early period of life, we can clearly see why the"
1228,"embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes should be so closely"
1228,"alike, and should be so unlike the adult forms. We may cease marvelling"
1228,at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird having branchial slits
1228,"and arteries running in loops, like those in a fish which has to breathe"
1228,"the air dissolved in water, by the aid of well-developed branchiae."
1228,
1228,"Disuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often tend to reduce"
1228,"an organ, when it has become useless by changed habits or under changed"
1228,conditions of life; and we can clearly understand on this view the
1228,meaning of rudimentary organs. But disuse and selection will generally
1228,"act on each creature, when it has come to maturity and has to play its"
1228,"full part in the struggle for existence, and will thus have little power"
1228,of acting on an organ during early life; hence the organ will not be
1228,"much reduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age. The calf, for"
1228,"instance, has inherited teeth, which never cut through the gums of the"
1228,"upper jaw, from an early progenitor having well-developed teeth; and we"
1228,"may believe, that the teeth in the mature animal were reduced, during"
1228,"successive generations, by disuse or by the tongue and palate having"
1228,been fitted by natural selection to browse without their aid; whereas in
1228,"the calf, the teeth have been left untouched by selection or disuse,"
1228,and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages have been
1228,inherited from a remote period to the present day. On the view of each
1228,"organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how"
1228,"utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic"
1228,calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some
1228,"beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility!"
1228,"Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs"
1228,"and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems"
1228,that we wilfully will not understand.
1228,
1228,I have now recapitulated the chief facts and considerations which have
1228,"thoroughly convinced me that species have changed, and are still slowly"
1228,changing by the preservation and accumulation of successive slight
1228,"favourable variations. Why, it may be asked, have all the most eminent"
1228,living naturalists and geologists rejected this view of the mutability
1228,of species? It cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state of
1228,nature are subject to no variation; it cannot be proved that the amount
1228,of variation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity; no clear
1228,"distinction has been, or can be, drawn between species and well-marked"
1228,varieties. It cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are
1228,"invariably sterile, and varieties invariably fertile; or that sterility"
1228,is a special endowment and sign of creation. The belief that species
1228,were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history
1228,of the world was thought to be of short duration; and now that we have
1228,"acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are too apt to assume,"
1228,"without proof, that the geological record is so perfect that it would"
1228,"have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species, if they had"
1228,undergone mutation.
1228,
1228,But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one
1228,"species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are"
1228,always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the
1228,intermediate steps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many
1228,"geologists, when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs"
1228,"had been formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the"
1228,coast-waves. The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the
1228,term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full
1228,"effects of many slight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite"
1228,number of generations.
1228,
1228,Although I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this
1228,"volume under the form of an abstract, I by no means expect to convince"
1228,experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of
1228,"facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view"
1228,directly opposite to mine. It is so easy to hide our ignorance under
1228,"such expressions as the ""plan of creation,"" ""unity of design,"" etc., and"
1228,to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact. Any
1228,one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained
1228,difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts
1228,"will certainly reject my theory. A few naturalists, endowed with"
1228,"much flexibility of mind, and who have already begun to doubt on the"
1228,"immutability of species, may be influenced by this volume; but I look"
1228,"with confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will"
1228,be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality. Whoever
1228,is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by
1228,conscientiously expressing his conviction; for only thus can the load of
1228,prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed.
1228,
1228,Several eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that
1228,a multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but
1228,"that other species are real, that is, have been independently created."
1228,This seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. They admit that
1228,"a multitude of forms, which till lately they themselves thought were"
1228,"special creations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of"
1228,"naturalists, and which consequently have every external characteristic"
1228,"feature of true species,--they admit that these have been produced by"
1228,"variation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and very"
1228,slightly different forms. Nevertheless they do not pretend that they
1228,"can define, or even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and"
1228,which are those produced by secondary laws. They admit variation as a
1228,"vera causa in one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without"
1228,assigning any distinction in the two cases. The day will come when this
1228,will be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived
1228,opinion. These authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of
1228,creation than at an ordinary birth. But do they really believe that at
1228,innumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have
1228,been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? Do they believe
1228,that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were
1228,produced? Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants
1228,"created as eggs or seed, or as full grown? and in the case of mammals,"
1228,were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the
1228,mother's womb? Although naturalists very properly demand a full
1228,explanation of every difficulty from those who believe in the mutability
1228,"of species, on their own side they ignore the whole subject of the first"
1228,appearance of species in what they consider reverent silence.
1228,
1228,It may be asked how far I extend the doctrine of the modification of
1228,"species. The question is difficult to answer, because the more distinct"
1228,"the forms are which we may consider, by so much the arguments fall away"
1228,in force. But some arguments of the greatest weight extend very far.
1228,All the members of whole classes can be connected together by chains of
1228,"affinities, and all can be classified on the same principle, in groups"
1228,subordinate to groups. Fossil remains sometimes tend to fill up
1228,very wide intervals between existing orders. Organs in a rudimentary
1228,condition plainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in a
1228,fully developed state; and this in some instances necessarily implies
1228,an enormous amount of modification in the descendants. Throughout whole
1228,"classes various structures are formed on the same pattern, and at an"
1228,embryonic age the species closely resemble each other. Therefore I
1228,cannot doubt that the theory of descent with modification embraces all
1228,the members of the same class. I believe that animals have descended
1228,"from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or"
1228,lesser number.
1228,
1228,"Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all"
1228,animals and plants have descended from some one prototype. But analogy
1228,may be a deceitful guide. Nevertheless all living things have much in
1228,"common, in their chemical composition, their germinal vesicles, their"
1228,"cellular structure, and their laws of growth and reproduction. We see"
1228,this even in so trifling a circumstance as that the same poison often
1228,similarly affects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by
1228,the gall-fly produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree.
1228,Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic
1228,beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some
1228,"one primordial form, into which life was first breathed. When the views"
1228,"entertained in this volume on the origin of species, or when analogous"
1228,"views are generally admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a"
1228,considerable revolution in natural history. Systematists will be able
1228,to pursue their labours as at present; but they will not be incessantly
1228,haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essence
1228,"a species. This I feel sure, and I speak after experience, will be no"
1228,slight relief. The endless disputes whether or not some fifty species
1228,of British brambles are true species will cease. Systematists will
1228,have only to decide (not that this will be easy) whether any form be
1228,"sufficiently constant and distinct from other forms, to be capable of"
1228,"definition; and if definable, whether the differences be sufficiently"
1228,important to deserve a specific name. This latter point will become a
1228,"far more essential consideration than it is at present; for differences,"
1228,"however slight, between any two forms, if not blended by intermediate"
1228,"gradations, are looked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raise"
1228,both forms to the rank of species. Hereafter we shall be compelled to
1228,acknowledge that the only distinction between species and well-marked
1228,"varieties is, that the latter are known, or believed, to be connected"
1228,"at the present day by intermediate gradations, whereas species"
1228,"were formerly thus connected. Hence, without quite rejecting the"
1228,consideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations
1228,"between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to"
1228,value higher the actual amount of difference between them. It is quite
1228,possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be merely varieties
1228,"may hereafter be thought worthy of specific names, as with the primrose"
1228,and cowslip; and in this case scientific and common language will come
1228,"into accordance. In short, we shall have to treat species in the same"
1228,"manner as those naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are"
1228,merely artificial combinations made for convenience. This may not be a
1228,cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search
1228,for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.
1228,
1228,The other and more general departments of natural history will rise
1228,"greatly in interest. The terms used by naturalists of affinity,"
1228,"relationship, community of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive"
1228,"characters, rudimentary and aborted organs, etc., will cease to be"
1228,"metaphorical, and will have a plain signification. When we no longer"
1228,"look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something"
1228,wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of
1228,nature as one which has had a history; when we contemplate every complex
1228,"structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each"
1228,"useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at"
1228,"any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the"
1228,"experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when"
1228,"we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from"
1228,"experience, will the study of natural history become!"
1228,
1228,"A grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the"
1228,"causes and laws of variation, on correlation of growth, on the effects"
1228,"of use and disuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so"
1228,forth. The study of domestic productions will rise immensely in value.
1228,A new variety raised by man will be a far more important and interesting
1228,subject for study than one more species added to the infinitude of
1228,"already recorded species. Our classifications will come to be, as far as"
1228,"they can be so made, genealogies; and will then truly give what may be"
1228,called the plan of creation. The rules for classifying will no doubt
1228,become simpler when we have a definite object in view. We possess no
1228,pedigrees or armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace
1228,"the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by"
1228,characters of any kind which have long been inherited. Rudimentary
1228,organs will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of long-lost
1228,"structures. Species and groups of species, which are called aberrant,"
1228,"and which may fancifully be called living fossils, will aid us in"
1228,forming a picture of the ancient forms of life. Embryology will reveal
1228,"to us the structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes of each"
1228,great class.
1228,
1228,"When we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species,"
1228,"and all the closely allied species of most genera, have within a not"
1228,"very remote period descended from one parent, and have migrated"
1228,from some one birthplace; and when we better know the many means
1228,"of migration, then, by the light which geology now throws, and will"
1228,"continue to throw, on former changes of climate and of the level of the"
1228,"land, we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable manner"
1228,the former migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world. Even at
1228,"present, by comparing the differences of the inhabitants of the sea"
1228,"on the opposite sides of a continent, and the nature of the various"
1228,inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means of
1228,"immigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography."
1228,
1228,The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection
1228,of the record. The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not
1228,"be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made"
1228,at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great
1228,fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on an
1228,"unusual concurrence of circumstances, and the blank intervals between"
1228,the successive stages as having been of vast duration. But we shall be
1228,able to gauge with some security the duration of these intervals by a
1228,comparison of the preceding and succeeding organic forms. We must be
1228,cautious in attempting to correlate as strictly contemporaneous
1228,"two formations, which include few identical species, by the general"
1228,succession of their forms of life. As species are produced and
1228,"exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes, and not"
1228,by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes; and as the most
1228,important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost
1228,"independent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions,"
1228,"namely, the mutual relation of organism to organism,--the improvement of"
1228,one being entailing the improvement or the extermination of others; it
1228,"follows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive"
1228,formations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual
1228,"time. A number of species, however, keeping in a body might remain for a"
1228,"long period unchanged, whilst within this same period, several of these"
1228,"species, by migrating into new countries and coming into competition"
1228,"with foreign associates, might become modified; so that we must not"
1228,overrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of time. During
1228,"early periods of the earth's history, when the forms of life were"
1228,"probably fewer and simpler, the rate of change was probably slower; and"
1228,"at the first dawn of life, when very few forms of the simplest structure"
1228,"existed, the rate of change may have been slow in an extreme degree. The"
1228,"whole history of the world, as at present known, although of a length"
1228,"quite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognised as a mere"
1228,"fragment of time, compared with the ages which have elapsed since"
1228,"the first creature, the progenitor of innumerable extinct and living"
1228,"descendants, was created."
1228,
1228,In the distant future I see open fields for far more important
1228,"researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the"
1228,necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.
1228,Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.
1228,
1228,Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view
1228,that each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords
1228,"better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator,"
1228,that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants
1228,"of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those"
1228,determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all
1228,"beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some"
1228,few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system
1228,"was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the"
1228,"past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its"
1228,unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species now living
1228,very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity;
1228,"for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the"
1228,"greater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many"
1228,"genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We"
1228,can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretel that it
1228,"will be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger"
1228,"and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new"
1228,and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal
1228,"descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may"
1228,feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once
1228,"been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world."
1228,Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally
1228,inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for
1228,"the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to"
1228,progress towards perfection.
1228,
1228,"It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many"
1228,"plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various"
1228,"insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth,"
1228,"and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different"
1228,"from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner,"
1228,"have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in"
1228,"the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is"
1228,almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct
1228,"action of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a"
1228,"Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a"
1228,"consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and"
1228,"the Extinction of less-improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature,"
1228,"from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable"
1228,"of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly"
1228,"follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several"
1228,"powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one;"
1228,"and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed"
1228,"law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful"
1228,"and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."
