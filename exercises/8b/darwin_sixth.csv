2009,AN HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE PROGRESS OF OPINION ON THE ORIGIN OF
2009,"SPECIES,"
2009,
2009,PREVIOUSLY TO THE PUBLICATION OF THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS WORK.
2009,
2009,I will here give a brief sketch of the progress of opinion on the Origin
2009,of Species. Until recently the great majority of naturalists believed
2009,"that species were immutable productions, and had been separately"
2009,created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors. Some few
2009,"naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species undergo"
2009,"modification, and that the existing forms of life are the descendants"
2009,by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over allusions to
2009,"the subject in the classical writers (Aristotle, in his ""Physicae"
2009,"Auscultationes"" (lib., cap., s.), after remarking that rain does not"
2009,"fall in order to make the corn grow, any more than it falls to spoil the"
2009,"farmer's corn when threshed out of doors, applies the same argument"
2009,"to organisation; and adds (as translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first"
2009,"pointed out the passage to me), ""So what hinders the different parts (of"
2009,the body) from having this merely accidental relation in nature? as the
2009,"teeth, for example, grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted"
2009,"for dividing, and the grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating"
2009,"the food; since they were not made for the sake of this, but it was the"
2009,result of accident. And in like manner as to other parts in which there
2009,"appears to exist an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all"
2009,things together (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if
2009,"they were made for the sake of something, these were preserved,"
2009,having been appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and
2009,"whatsoever things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish."""
2009,"We here see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but"
2009,"how little Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his"
2009,"remarks on the formation of the teeth.), the first author who in modern"
2009,times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon. But as his
2009,"opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he does not"
2009,"enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species, I need"
2009,not here enter on details.
2009,
2009,Lamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much
2009,attention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views
2009,"in ; he much enlarged them in  in his ""Philosophie Zoologique"","
2009,"and subsequently, , in the Introduction to his ""Hist. Nat. des"
2009,"Animaux sans Vertebres"". In these works he up holds the doctrine that"
2009,"all species, including man, are descended from other species. He first"
2009,did the eminent service of arousing attention to the probability of
2009,"all change in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the"
2009,"result of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems"
2009,to have been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of
2009,"species, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties,"
2009,"by the almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by"
2009,the analogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of
2009,"modification, he attributed something to the direct action of the"
2009,"physical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already"
2009,"existing forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of"
2009,habit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful
2009,adaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for
2009,browsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law
2009,"of progressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to"
2009,"progress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of"
2009,"simple productions, he maintains that such forms are now spontaneously"
2009,generated. (I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck
2009,"from Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's (""Hist. Nat. Generale"", tom. ii."
2009,"page , ) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In"
2009,this work a full account is given of Buffon's conclusions on the same
2009,"subject. It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,"
2009,anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in
2009,"his ""Zoonomia"" (vol. i. pages -), published in . According to"
2009,Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme partisan of
2009,"similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work written in "
2009,"and , but not published till long afterward; he has pointedly"
2009,"remarked (""Goethe als Naturforscher"", von Dr. Karl Meding, s. ) that"
2009,"the future question for naturalists will be how, for instance, cattle"
2009,got their horns and not for what they are used. It is rather a singular
2009,instance of the manner in which similar views arise at about the same
2009,"time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in England, and Geoffroy"
2009,"Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in France, came to the same"
2009,"conclusion on the origin of species, in the years -.)"
2009,
2009,"Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his ""Life"", written by his"
2009,"son, suspected, as early as , that what we call species are various"
2009,degenerations of the same type. It was not until  that he published
2009,his conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since
2009,the origin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the
2009,"conditions of life, or the ""monde ambiant"" as the cause of change. He"
2009,"was cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing"
2009,"species are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, ""C'est"
2009,"donc un probleme a reserver entierement a l'avenir, suppose meme que"
2009,"l'avenir doive avoir prise sur lui."""
2009,
2009,"In  Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society ""An Account of a"
2009,"White Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro""; but his"
2009,"paper was not published until his famous ""Two Essays upon Dew and Single"
2009,"Vision"" appeared in . In this paper he distinctly recognises the"
2009,"principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition which"
2009,"has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man, and to"
2009,certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and mulattoes
2009,"enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he observes, firstly,"
2009,"that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and, secondly, that"
2009,agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by selection; and
2009,"then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case ""by art, seems to"
2009,"be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by nature, in the"
2009,"formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the country which they"
2009,"inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which would occur among"
2009,"the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle regions of Africa,"
2009,some one would be better fitted than others to bear the diseases of the
2009,"country. This race would consequently multiply, while the others would"
2009,decrease; not only from their in ability to sustain the attacks of
2009,"disease, but from their incapacity of contending with their more"
2009,vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I take for
2009,"granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But the same"
2009,"disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a darker race"
2009,would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would be the best
2009,"fitted for the climate, this would at length become the most prevalent,"
2009,"if not the only race, in the particular country in which it had"
2009,"originated."" He then extends these same views to the white inhabitants"
2009,"of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the United States,"
2009,"for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to the above passage"
2009,of Dr. Wells' work.
2009,
2009,"The Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the"
2009,"fourth volume of the ""Horticultural Transactions"", , and in his"
2009,"work on the ""Amaryllidaceae"" (, pages , ), declares that"
2009,"""horticultural experiments have established, beyond the possibility of"
2009,"refutation, that botanical species are only a higher and more permanent"
2009,"class of varieties."" He extends the same view to animals. The dean"
2009,believes that single species of each genus were created in an originally
2009,"highly plastic condition, and that these have produced, chiefly by"
2009,"inter-crossing, but likewise by variation, all our existing species."
2009,
2009,"In  Professor Grant, in the concluding paragraph in his well-known"
2009,"paper (""Edinburgh Philosophical Journal"", vol. XIV, page ) on the"
2009,"Spongilla, clearly declares his belief that species are descended"
2009,"from other species, and that they become improved in the course of"
2009,"modification. This same view was given in his Fifty-fifth Lecture,"
2009,"published in the ""Lancet"" in ."
2009,
2009,"In  Mr. Patrick Matthew published his work on ""Naval Timber and"
2009,"Arboriculture"", in which he gives precisely the same view on the origin"
2009,of species as that (presently to be alluded to) propounded by Mr.
2009,"Wallace and myself in the ""Linnean Journal"", and as that enlarged in"
2009,the present volume. Unfortunately the view was given by Mr. Matthew very
2009,briefly in scattered passages in an appendix to a work on a different
2009,"subject, so that it remained unnoticed until Mr. Matthew himself drew"
2009,"attention to it in the ""Gardeners' Chronicle"", on April , . The"
2009,differences of Mr. Matthew's views from mine are not of much importance:
2009,he seems to consider that the world was nearly depopulated at successive
2009,"periods, and then restocked; and he gives as an alternative, that new"
2009,"forms may be generated ""without the presence of any mold or germ of"
2009,"former aggregates."" I am not sure that I understand some passages; but"
2009,it seems that he attributes much influence to the direct action of
2009,"the conditions of life. He clearly saw, however, the full force of the"
2009,principle of natural selection.
2009,
2009,"The celebrated geologist and naturalist, Von Buch, in his excellent"
2009,"""Description Physique des Isles Canaries"" (, page ), clearly"
2009,expresses his belief that varieties slowly become changed into permanent
2009,"species, which are no longer capable of intercrossing."
2009,
2009,"Rafinesque, in his ""New Flora of North America"", published in ,"
2009,"wrote (page ) as follows: ""All species might have been varieties once,"
2009,and many varieties are gradually becoming species by assuming constant
2009,"and peculiar characters;"" but further on (page ) he adds, ""except the"
2009,"original types or ancestors of the genus."""
2009,
2009,"In - Professor Haldeman (""Boston Journal of Nat. Hist. U. States"","
2009,"vol. iv, page ) has ably given the arguments for and against the"
2009,hypothesis of the development and modification of species: he seems to
2009,lean toward the side of change.
2009,
2009,"The ""Vestiges of Creation"" appeared in . In the tenth and much"
2009,"improved edition () the anonymous author says (page ): ""The"
2009,"proposition determined on after much consideration is, that the several"
2009,"series of animated beings, from the simplest and oldest up to the"
2009,"highest and most recent, are, under the providence of God, the results,"
2009,"FIRST, of an impulse which has been imparted to the forms of life,"
2009,"advancing them, in definite times, by generation, through grades of"
2009,"organisation terminating in the highest dicotyledons and vertebrata,"
2009,"these grades being few in number, and generally marked by intervals"
2009,"of organic character, which we find to be a practical difficulty in"
2009,"ascertaining affinities; SECOND, of another impulse connected with the"
2009,"vital forces, tending, in the course of generations, to modify organic"
2009,"structures in accordance with external circumstances, as food, the"
2009,"nature of the habitat, and the meteoric agencies, these being the"
2009,"'adaptations' of the natural theologian."" The author apparently believes"
2009,"that organisation progresses by sudden leaps, but that the effects"
2009,produced by the conditions of life are gradual. He argues with much
2009,force on general grounds that species are not immutable productions.
2009,"But I cannot see how the two supposed ""impulses"" account in a scientific"
2009,sense for the numerous and beautiful coadaptations which we see
2009,"throughout nature; I cannot see that we thus gain any insight how, for"
2009,"instance, a woodpecker has become adapted to its peculiar habits of"
2009,"life. The work, from its powerful and brilliant style, though displaying"
2009,in the early editions little accurate knowledge and a great want of
2009,"scientific caution, immediately had a very wide circulation. In my"
2009,opinion it has done excellent service in this country in calling
2009,"attention to the subject, in removing prejudice, and in thus preparing"
2009,the ground for the reception of analogous views.
2009,
2009,In  the veteran geologist M.J. d'Omalius d'Halloy published in an
2009,"excellent though short paper (""Bulletins de l'Acad. Roy. Bruxelles"","
2009,"tom. xiii, page ) his opinion that it is more probable that new"
2009,species have been produced by descent with modification than that they
2009,have been separately created: the author first promulgated this opinion
2009,in .
2009,
2009,"Professor Owen, in  (""Nature of Limbs"", page ), wrote as follows:"
2009,"""The archetypal idea was manifested in the flesh under diverse such"
2009,"modifications, upon this planet, long prior to the existence of those"
2009,animal species that actually exemplify it. To what natural laws or
2009,secondary causes the orderly succession and progression of such organic
2009,"phenomena may have been committed, we, as yet, are ignorant."" In his"
2009,"address to the British Association, in , he speaks (page li) of ""the"
2009,"axiom of the continuous operation of creative power, or of the ordained"
2009,"becoming of living things."" Further on (page xc), after referring"
2009,"to geographical distribution, he adds, ""These phenomena shake our"
2009,confidence in the conclusion that the Apteryx of New Zealand and the
2009,Red Grouse of England were distinct creations in and for those islands
2009,"respectively. Always, also, it may be well to bear in mind that by the"
2009,"word 'creation' the zoologist means 'a process he knows not what.'"" He"
2009,amplifies this idea by adding that when such cases as that of the Red
2009,"Grouse are ""enumerated by the zoologist as evidence of distinct creation"
2009,"of the bird in and for such islands, he chiefly expresses that he"
2009,"knows not how the Red Grouse came to be there, and there exclusively;"
2009,"signifying also, by this mode of expressing such ignorance, his belief"
2009,that both the bird and the islands owed their origin to a great first
2009,"Creative Cause."" If we interpret these sentences given in the same"
2009,"address, one by the other, it appears that this eminent philosopher felt"
2009,in  his confidence shaken that the Apteryx and the Red Grouse first
2009,"appeared in their respective homes ""he knew not how,"" or by some process"
2009,"""he knew not what."""
2009,
2009,This address was delivered after the papers by Mr. Wallace and myself on
2009,"the Origin of Species, presently to be referred to, had been read before"
2009,"the Linnean Society. When the first edition of this work was published,"
2009,"I was so completely deceived, as were many others, by such expressions"
2009,"as ""the continuous operation of creative power,"" that I included"
2009,Professor Owen with other palaeontologists as being firmly convinced
2009,"of the immutability of species; but it appears (""Anat. of Vertebrates"","
2009,"vol. iii, page ) that this was on my part a preposterous error. In"
2009,"the last edition of this work I inferred, and the inference still seems"
2009,"to me perfectly just, from a passage beginning with the words ""no doubt"
2009,"the type-form,"" etc.(Ibid., vol. i, page xxxv), that Professor Owen"
2009,admitted that natural selection may have done something in the formation
2009,"of a new species; but this it appears (Ibid., vol. iii. page )"
2009,is inaccurate and without evidence. I also gave some extracts from a
2009,"correspondence between Professor Owen and the editor of the ""London"
2009,"Review"", from which it appeared manifest to the editor as well as to"
2009,"myself, that Professor Owen claimed to have promulgated the theory of"
2009,natural selection before I had done so; and I expressed my surprise
2009,and satisfaction at this announcement; but as far as it is possible to
2009,"understand certain recently published passages (Ibid., vol. iii. page"
2009,) I have either partially or wholly again fallen into error. It
2009,is consolatory to me that others find Professor Owen's controversial
2009,"writings as difficult to understand and to reconcile with each other,"
2009,as I do. As far as the mere enunciation of the principle of natural
2009,"selection is concerned, it is quite immaterial whether or not Professor"
2009,"Owen preceded me, for both of us, as shown in this historical sketch,"
2009,were long ago preceded by Dr. Wells and Mr. Matthews.
2009,
2009,"M. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, in his lectures delivered in  (of"
2009,"which a Resume appeared in the ""Revue et Mag. de Zoolog."", Jan., ),"
2009,"briefly gives his reason for believing that specific characters ""sont"
2009,"fixes, pour chaque espece, tant qu'elle se perpetue au milieu des memes"
2009,"circonstances: ils se modifient, si les circonstances ambiantes viennent"
2009,"a changer. En resume, L'OBSERVATION des animaux sauvages demontre deja"
2009,la variabilite LIMITEE des especes. Les EXPERIENCES sur les animaux
2009,"sauvages devenus domestiques, et sur les animaux domestiques redevenus"
2009,"sauvages, la demontrent plus clairment encore. Ces memes experiences"
2009,"prouvent, de plus, que les differences produites peuvent etre de VALEUR"
2009,"GENERIQUE."" In his ""Hist. Nat. Generale"" (tom. ii, page , ) he"
2009,amplifies analogous conclusions.
2009,
2009,"From a circular lately issued it appears that Dr. Freke, in "
2009,"(""Dublin Medical Press"", page ), propounded the doctrine that all"
2009,organic beings have descended from one primordial form. His grounds of
2009,belief and treatment of the subject are wholly different from mine;
2009,"but as Dr. Freke has now () published his Essay on the ""Origin of"
2009,"Species by means of Organic Affinity"", the difficult attempt to give any"
2009,idea of his views would be superfluous on my part.
2009,
2009,"Mr. Herbert Spencer, in an Essay (originally published in the ""Leader"","
2009,"March, , and republished in his ""Essays"", in ), has contrasted"
2009,the theories of the Creation and the Development of organic beings
2009,with remarkable skill and force. He argues from the analogy of domestic
2009,"productions, from the changes which the embryos of many species undergo,"
2009,"from the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, and from"
2009,"the principle of general gradation, that species have been modified;"
2009,and he attributes the modification to the change of circumstances.
2009,The author () has also treated Psychology on the principle of the
2009,necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.
2009,
2009,"In  M. Naudin, a distinguished botanist, expressly stated, in an"
2009,"admirable paper on the Origin of Species (""Revue Horticole"", page ;"
2009,"since partly republished in the ""Nouvelles Archives du Museum"", tom. i,"
2009,"page ), his belief that species are formed in an analogous manner as"
2009,varieties are under cultivation; and the latter process he attributes to
2009,man's power of selection. But he does not show how selection acts under
2009,"nature. He believes, like Dean Herbert, that species, when nascent,"
2009,were more plastic than at present. He lays weight on what he calls the
2009,"principle of finality, ""puissance mysterieuse, indeterminee; fatalite"
2009,"pour les uns; pour les autres volonte providentielle, dont l'action"
2009,"incessante sur les etres vivantes determine, a toutes les epoques de"
2009,"l'existence du monde, la forme, le volume, et la duree de chacun d'eux,"

2009,"C'est cette puissance qui harmonise chaque membre a l'ensemble, en"
2009,l'appropriant a la fonction qu'il doit remplir dans l'organisme general
2009,"de la nature, fonction qui est pour lui sa raison d'etre."" (From"
2009,"references in Bronn's ""Untersuchungen uber die Entwickelungs-Gesetze"","
2009,it appears that the celebrated botanist and palaeontologist Unger
2009,"published, in , his belief that species undergo development and"
2009,"modification. Dalton, likewise, in Pander and Dalton's work on Fossil"
2009,"Sloths, expressed, in , a similar belief. Similar views have, as is"
2009,"well known, been maintained by Oken in his mystical ""Natur-Philosophie""."
2009,"From other references in Godron's work ""Sur l'Espece"", it seems that"
2009,"Bory St. Vincent, Burdach, Poiret and Fries, have all admitted that"
2009,"new species are continually being produced. I may add, that of the"
2009,"thirty-four authors named in this Historical Sketch, who believe in"
2009,"the modification of species, or at least disbelieve in separate acts"
2009,"of creation, twenty-seven have written on special branches of natural"
2009,history or geology.)
2009,
2009,"In  a celebrated geologist, Count Keyserling (""Bulletin de la Soc."
2009,"Geolog."", nd Ser., tom. x, page ), suggested that as new diseases,"
2009,supposed to have been caused by some miasma have arisen and spread over
2009,"the world, so at certain periods the germs of existing species may have"
2009,been chemically affected by circumambient molecules of a particular
2009,"nature, and thus have given rise to new forms."
2009,
2009,"In this same year, , Dr. Schaaffhausen published an excellent"
2009,"pamphlet (""Verhand. des Naturhist. Vereins der Preuss. Rheinlands"","
2009,"etc.), in which he maintains the development of organic forms on the"
2009,"earth. He infers that many species have kept true for long periods,"
2009,whereas a few have become modified. The distinction of species he
2009,"explains by the destruction of intermediate graduated forms. ""Thus"
2009,living plants and animals are not separated from the extinct by new
2009,"creations, but are to be regarded as their descendants through continued"
2009,"reproduction."""
2009,
2009,"A well-known French botanist, M. Lecoq, writes in  (""Etudes sur"
2009,"Geograph."" Bot. tom. i, page ), ""On voit que nos recherches sur la"

2009,"idees emises par deux hommes justement celebres, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire"
2009,"et Goethe."" Some other passages scattered through M. Lecoq's large"
2009,work make it a little doubtful how far he extends his views on the
2009,modification of species.

2009,"The ""Philosophy of Creation"" has been treated in a masterly manner by"
2009,"the Rev. Baden Powell, in his ""Essays on the Unity of Worlds"", ."
2009,Nothing can be more striking than the manner in which he shows that the
2009,"introduction of new species is ""a regular, not a casual phenomenon,"" or,"
2009,"as Sir John Herschel expresses it, ""a natural in contradistinction to a"
2009,"miraculous process."""

2009,"The third volume of the ""Journal of the Linnean Society"" contains"
2009,"papers, read July , , by Mr. Wallace and myself, in which, as"
2009,"stated in the introductory remarks to this volume, the theory of"
2009,Natural Selection is promulgated by Mr. Wallace with admirable force and
2009,clearness.
2009,
2009,"Von Baer, toward whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect,"
2009,"expressed about the year  (see Prof. Rudolph Wagner,"
2009,"""Zoologisch-Anthropologische Untersuchungen"", , s. ) his"
2009,"conviction, chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution,"
2009,that forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single
2009,parent-form.
2009,
2009,"In June, , Professor Huxley gave a lecture before the Royal"
2009,"Institution on the ""Persistent Types of Animal Life"". Referring to such"
2009,"cases, he remarks, ""It is difficult to comprehend the meaning of such"
2009,"facts as these, if we suppose that each species of animal and plant, or"
2009,"each great type of organisation, was formed and placed upon the surface"
2009,of the globe at long intervals by a distinct act of creative power; and
2009,it is well to recollect that such an assumption is as unsupported by
2009,tradition or revelation as it is opposed to the general analogy of
2009,"nature. If, on the other hand, we view ""Persistent Types"" in relation to"
2009,that hypothesis which supposes the species living at any time to be the
2009,"result of the gradual modification of pre-existing species, a hypothesis"
2009,"which, though unproven, and sadly damaged by some of its supporters,"
2009,is yet the only one to which physiology lends any countenance; their
2009,existence would seem to show that the amount of modification which
2009,living beings have undergone during geological time is but very small in
2009,"relation to the whole series of changes which they have suffered."""
2009,
2009,"In December, , Dr. Hooker published his ""Introduction to the"
2009,"Australian Flora"". In the first part of this great work he admits the"
2009,"truth of the descent and modification of species, and supports this"
2009,doctrine by many original observations.

2009,INTRODUCTION.
2009,
2009,"When on board H.M.S. Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with"
2009,certain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting South
2009,"America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past"
2009,"inhabitants of that continent. These facts, as will be seen in the"
2009,"latter chapters of this volume, seemed to throw some light on the origin"
2009,"of species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one"
2009,"of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me,"
2009,"in , that something might perhaps be made out on this question by"
2009,patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could
2009,possibly have any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself
2009,"to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I"
2009,"enlarged in  into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to"
2009,me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued
2009,the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these
2009,"personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in"
2009,coming to a decision.
2009,
2009,My work is now () nearly finished; but as it will take me many more
2009,"years to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been"
2009,urged to publish this abstract. I have more especially been induced to
2009,"do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of"
2009,"the Malay Archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general"
2009,conclusions that I have on the origin of species. In  he sent me a
2009,"memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it to Sir"
2009,"Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published"
2009,in the third volume of the Journal of that Society. Sir C. Lyell and Dr.
2009,"Hooker, who both knew of my work--the latter having read my sketch"
2009,"of --honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with Mr."
2009,"Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts."
2009,
2009,"This abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I"
2009,cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements;
2009,and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy.
2009,"No doubt errors may have crept in, though I hope I have always been"
2009,cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. I can here give only
2009,"the general conclusions at which I have arrived, with a few facts in"
2009,"illustration, but which, I hope, in most cases will suffice. No one can"
2009,feel more sensible than I do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in
2009,"detail all the facts, with references, on which my conclusions have been"
2009,grounded; and I hope in a future work to do this. For I am well aware
2009,that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts
2009,"cannot be adduced, often apparently leading to conclusions directly"
2009,opposite to those at which I have arrived. A fair result can be obtained
2009,only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both
2009,sides of each question; and this is here impossible.
2009,
2009,I much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of
2009,acknowledging the generous assistance which I have received from very
2009,"many naturalists, some of them personally unknown to me. I cannot,"
2009,"however, let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep"
2009,"obligations to Dr. Hooker, who, for the last fifteen years, has aided me"
2009,in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent
2009,judgment.
2009,
2009,"In considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a"
2009,"naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings,"
2009,"on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution,"
2009,"geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the"
2009,"conclusion that species had not been independently created, but had"
2009,"descended, like varieties, from other species. Nevertheless, such a"
2009,"conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it"
2009,"could be shown how the innumerable species, inhabiting this world"
2009,"have been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure"
2009,and coadaptation which justly excites our admiration. Naturalists
2009,"continually refer to external conditions, such as climate, food, etc.,"
2009,"as the only possible cause of variation. In one limited sense, as"
2009,"we shall hereafter see, this may be true; but it is preposterous to"
2009,"attribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance,"
2009,"of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably"
2009,adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees. In the case of the
2009,"mistletoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees, which has"
2009,"seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has flowers"
2009,with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects
2009,"to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally preposterous"
2009,"to account for the structure of this parasite, with its relations to"
2009,"several distinct organic beings, by the effects of external conditions,"
2009,"or of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself."
2009,
2009,"It is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into"
2009,the means of modification and coadaptation. At the commencement of
2009,my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of
2009,domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best
2009,chance of making out this obscure problem. Nor have I been disappointed;
2009,in this and in all other perplexing cases I have invariably found that
2009,"our knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication,"
2009,afforded the best and safest clue. I may venture to express my
2009,"conviction of the high value of such studies, although they have been"
2009,very commonly neglected by naturalists.
2009,
2009,"From these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this"
2009,abstract to variation under domestication. We shall thus see that a
2009,"large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible; and, what"
2009,"is equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man"
2009,in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations. I will
2009,then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature; but
2009,"I shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too"
2009,"briefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of"
2009,"facts. We shall, however, be enabled to discuss what circumstances"
2009,are most favourable to variation. In the next chapter the struggle
2009,"for existence among all organic beings throughout the world, which"
2009,"inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of their increase,"
2009,"will be considered. This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the"
2009,whole animal and vegetable kingdoms. As many more individuals of each
2009,"species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there"
2009,"is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any"
2009,"being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself,"
2009,"under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have"
2009,"a better chance of surviving, and thus be NATURALLY SELECTED. From"
2009,"the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to"
2009,propagate its new and modified form.
2009,
2009,This fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at
2009,some length in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how natural
2009,selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved
2009,"forms of life, and leads to what I have called divergence of character."
2009,In the next chapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws
2009,"of variation. In the five succeeding chapters, the most apparent and"
2009,"gravest difficulties in accepting the theory will be given: namely,"
2009,"first, the difficulties of transitions, or how a simple being or a"
2009,simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed
2009,being or into an elaborately constructed organ; secondly the subject of
2009,"instinct, or the mental powers of animals; thirdly, hybridism, or the"
2009,infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed;
2009,"and fourthly, the imperfection of the geological record. In the next"
2009,chapter I shall consider the geological succession of organic beings
2009,"throughout time; in the twelfth and thirteenth, their geographical"
2009,"distribution throughout space; in the fourteenth, their classification"
2009,"or mutual affinities, both when mature and in an embryonic condition. In"
2009,"the last chapter I shall give a brief recapitulation of the whole work,"
2009,and a few concluding remarks.
2009,
2009,No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in
2009,"regard to the origin of species and varieties, if he make due allowance"
2009,for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of the
2009,many beings which live around us. Who can explain why one species ranges
2009,"widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow"
2009,"range and is rare? Yet these relations are of the highest importance,"
2009,"for they determine the present welfare and, as I believe, the future"
2009,success and modification of every inhabitant of this world. Still less
2009,do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the
2009,world during the many past geological epochs in its history. Although
2009,"much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no"
2009,"doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of"
2009,"which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists until recently"
2009,"entertained, and which I formerly entertained--namely, that each species"
2009,has been independently created--is erroneous. I am fully convinced that
2009,species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called
2009,the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally
2009,"extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of"
2009,"any one species are the descendants of that species. Furthermore, I am"
2009,"convinced that natural selection has been the most important, but not"
2009,"the exclusive, means of modification."

2009,CAUSES OF VARIABILITY.
2009,
2009,When we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of
2009,"our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which"
2009,"strikes us is, that they generally differ more from each other than do"
2009,the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. And
2009,if we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have
2009,"been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most"
2009,"different climates and treatment, we are driven to conclude that this"
2009,great variability is due to our domestic productions having been raised
2009,"under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from,"
2009,those to which the parent species had been exposed under nature. There
2009,"is, also, some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that"
2009,this variability may be partly connected with excess of food. It seems
2009,clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to
2009,"new conditions to cause any great amount of variation; and that, when"
2009,"the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues varying"
2009,for many generations. No case is on record of a variable organism
2009,"ceasing to vary under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such"
2009,"as wheat, still yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are"
2009,still capable of rapid improvement or modification.
2009,
2009,"As far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, the"
2009,conditions of life appear to act in two ways--directly on the whole
2009,organisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting the
2009,"reproductive system. With respect to the direct action, we must bear in"
2009,"mind that in every case, as Professor Weismann has lately insisted,"
2009,"and as I have incidently shown in my work on ""Variation under"
2009,"Domestication,"" there are two factors: namely, the nature of the"
2009,organism and the nature of the conditions. The former seems to be much
2009,"the more important; for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under,"
2009,"as far as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and, on the other hand,"
2009,dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be
2009,nearly uniform. The effects on the offspring are either definite or in
2009,definite. They may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the
2009,offspring of individuals exposed to certain conditions during several
2009,generations are modified in the same manner. It is extremely difficult
2009,to come to any conclusion in regard to the extent of the changes which
2009,"have been thus definitely induced. There can, however, be little doubt"
2009,"about many slight changes, such as size from the amount of food,"
2009,"colour from the nature of the food, thickness of the skin and hair from"
2009,"climate, etc. Each of the endless variations which we see in the plumage"
2009,of our fowls must have had some efficient cause; and if the same cause
2009,were to act uniformly during a long series of generations on many
2009,"individuals, all probably would be modified in the same manner. Such"
2009,facts as the complex and extraordinary out growths which variably
2009,follow from the insertion of a minute drop of poison by a gall-producing
2009,"insect, shows us what singular modifications might result in the case of"
2009,plants from a chemical change in the nature of the sap.
2009,
2009,In definite variability is a much more common result of changed
2009,"conditions than definite variability, and has probably played a more"
2009,important part in the formation of our domestic races. We see in
2009,definite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which
2009,"distinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be"
2009,accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote
2009,ancestor. Even strongly-marked differences occasionally appear in the
2009,"young of the same litter, and in seedlings from the same seed-capsule."
2009,"At long intervals of time, out of millions of individuals reared in the"
2009,"same country and fed on nearly the same food, deviations of structure so"
2009,strongly pronounced as to deserve to be called monstrosities arise; but
2009,monstrosities cannot be separated by any distinct line from slighter
2009,"variations. All such changes of structure, whether extremely slight or"
2009,"strongly marked, which appear among many individuals living together,"
2009,may be considered as the in definite effects of the conditions of life
2009,"on each individual organism, in nearly the same manner as the chill"
2009,"effects different men in an in definite manner, according to their"
2009,"state of body or constitution, causing coughs or colds, rheumatism, or"
2009,inflammation of various organs.
2009,
2009,With respect to what I have called the in direct action of changed
2009,"conditions, namely, through the reproductive system of being affected,"
2009,"we may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of"
2009,"this system being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions,"
2009,"and partly from the similarity, as Kolreuter and others have remarked,"
2009,between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct
2009,"species, and that which may be observed with plants and animals when"
2009,reared under new or unnatural conditions. Many facts clearly show how
2009,eminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes
2009,in the surrounding conditions. Nothing is more easy than to tame an
2009,"animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely"
2009,"under confinement, even when the male and female unite. How many animals"
2009,"there are which will not breed, though kept in an almost free state in"
2009,"their native country! This is generally, but erroneously attributed to"
2009,"vitiated instincts. Many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour,"
2009,and yet rarely or never seed! In some few cases it has been discovered
2009,"that a very trifling change, such as a little more or less water at some"
2009,"particular period of growth, will determine whether or not a plant will"
2009,produce seeds. I cannot here give the details which I have collected and
2009,elsewhere published on this curious subject; but to show how singular
2009,the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under
2009,"confinement, I may mention that carnivorous animals, even from the"
2009,"tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with"
2009,"the exception of the plantigrades or bear family, which seldom produce"
2009,"young; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exception, hardly"
2009,"ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless,"
2009,"in the same condition as in the most sterile hybrids. When, on the one"
2009,"hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and"
2009,"sickly, breeding freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand,"
2009,"we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature perfectly"
2009,"tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous"
2009,"instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected"
2009,"by unperceived causes as to fail to act, we need not be surprised at"
2009,"this system, when it does act under confinement, acting irregularly,"
2009,and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents. I may add that
2009,as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditions--for
2009,"instance, rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches--showing that their"
2009,reproductive organs are not easily affected; so will some animals
2009,"and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very"
2009,slightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.
2009,
2009,Some naturalists have maintained that all variations are connected with
2009,the act of sexual reproduction; but this is certainly an error; for I
2009,"have given in another work a long list of ""sporting plants;"" as they are"
2009,"called by gardeners; that is, of plants which have suddenly produced a"
2009,single bud with a new and sometimes widely different character from that
2009,"of the other buds on the same plant. These bud variations, as they may"
2009,"be named, can be propagated by grafts, offsets, etc., and sometimes"
2009,"by seed. They occur rarely under nature, but are far from rare under"
2009,culture. As a single bud out of many thousands produced year after year
2009,"on the same tree under uniform conditions, has been known suddenly to"
2009,"assume a new character; and as buds on distinct trees, growing"
2009,"under different conditions, have sometimes yielded nearly the same"
2009,"variety--for instance, buds on peach-trees producing nectarines, and"
2009,buds on common roses producing moss-roses--we clearly see that the
2009,nature of the conditions is of subordinate importance in comparison
2009,with the nature of the organism in determining each particular form of
2009,"variation; perhaps of not more importance than the nature of the spark,"
2009,"by which a mass of combustible matter is ignited, has in determining the"
2009,nature of the flames.
2009,
2009,EFFECTS OF HABIT AND OF THE USE OR DISUSE OF PARTS; CORRELATED
2009,VARIATION; INHERITANCE.
2009,
2009,Changed habits produce an inherited effect as in the period of the
2009,flowering of plants when transported from one climate to another. With
2009,animals the increased use or disuse of parts has had a more marked
2009,influence; thus I find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing
2009,"weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the whole"
2009,"skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild duck; and this change may"
2009,"be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less, and walking"
2009,"more, than its wild parents. The great and inherited development of the"
2009,"udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked,"
2009,"in comparison with these organs in other countries, is probably another"
2009,instance of the effects of use. Not one of our domestic animals can be
2009,named which has not in some country drooping ears; and the view which
2009,has been suggested that the drooping is due to disuse of the muscles of
2009,"the ear, from the animals being seldom much alarmed, seems probable."
2009,
2009,"Many laws regulate variation, some few of which can be dimly seen, and"
2009,will hereafter be briefly discussed. I will here only allude to what may
2009,be called correlated variation. Important changes in the embryo or larva
2009,"will probably entail changes in the mature animal. In monstrosities,"
2009,the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious; and many
2009,instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire's great work on this
2009,subject. Breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied
2009,by an elongated head. Some instances of correlation are quite whimsical;
2009,thus cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally
2009,deaf; but it has been lately stated by Mr. Tait that this is confined to
2009,"the males. Colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which"
2009,many remarkable cases could be given among animals and plants. From
2009,"facts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs"
2009,"are injured by certain plants, while dark-coloured individuals escape:"
2009,Professor Wyman has recently communicated to me a good illustration of
2009,this fact; on asking some farmers in Virginia how it was that all their
2009,"pigs were black, they informed him that the pigs ate the paint-root"
2009,"(Lachnanthes), which coloured their bones pink, and which caused"
2009,the hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off; and one of the
2009,"""crackers"" (i.e. Virginia squatters) added, ""we select the black members"
2009,"of a litter for raising, as they alone have a good chance of living."""
2009,Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and coarse-haired
2009,"animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons"
2009,with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with
2009,"short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet. Hence"
2009,"if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any peculiarity, he will"
2009,"almost certainly modify unintentionally other parts of the structure,"
2009,owing to the mysterious laws of correlation.
2009,
2009,"The results of the various, unknown, or but dimly understood laws of"
2009,variation are infinitely complex and diversified. It is well worth while
2009,carefully to study the several treatises on some of our old cultivated
2009,"plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, etc.; and it"
2009,is really surprising to note the endless points of structure and
2009,constitution in which the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly
2009,"from each other. The whole organisation seems to have become plastic,"
2009,and departs in a slight degree from that of the parental type.
2009,
2009,Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. But the
2009,"number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both"
2009,"those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance,"
2009,"are endless. Dr. Prosper Lucas' treatise, in two large volumes, is the"
2009,fullest and the best on this subject. No breeder doubts how strong is
2009,the tendency to inheritance; that like produces like is his fundamental
2009,belief: doubts have been thrown on this principle only by theoretical
2009,"writers. When any deviation of structure often appears, and we see it"
2009,"in the father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the"
2009,"same cause having acted on both; but when among individuals, apparently"
2009,"exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some"
2009,"extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent--say,"
2009,once among several million individuals--and it reappears in the
2009,"child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute"
2009,its reappearance to inheritance. Every one must have heard of cases of
2009,"albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, etc., appearing in several members"
2009,of the same family. If strange and rare deviations of structure are
2009,"truly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely"
2009,admitted to be inheritable. Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole
2009,"subject would be, to look at the inheritance of every character whatever"
2009,"as the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly."
2009,
2009,The laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown; no one
2009,can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same
2009,"species, or in different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes"
2009,not so; why the child often reverts in certain characteristics to its
2009,grandfather or grandmother or more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is
2009,"often transmitted from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone,"
2009,more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex. It is a fact of
2009,"some importance to us, that peculiarities appearing in the males of our"
2009,"domestic breeds are often transmitted, either exclusively or in a much"
2009,"greater degree, to the males alone. A much more important rule, which I"
2009,"think may be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity"
2009,"first appears, it tends to reappear in the offspring at a corresponding"
2009,"age, though sometimes earlier. In many cases this could not be"
2009,otherwise; thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could
2009,appear only in the offspring when nearly mature; peculiarities in the
2009,silk-worm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon
2009,stage. But hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe
2009,"that the rule has a wider extension, and that, when there is no apparent"
2009,"reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age, yet that"
2009,it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it
2009,first appeared in the parent. I believe this rule to be of the highest
2009,importance in explaining the laws of embryology. These remarks are of
2009,"course confined to the first APPEARANCE of the peculiarity, and not"
2009,to the primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or on the male
2009,element; in nearly the same manner as the increased length of the horns
2009,"in the offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull, though"
2009,"appearing late in life, is clearly due to the male element."
2009,
2009,"Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to"
2009,"a statement often made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic"
2009,"varieties, when run wild, gradually but invariably revert in character"
2009,to their aboriginal stocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions
2009,can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature. I
2009,have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above
2009,statement has so often and so boldly been made. There would be great
2009,difficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many
2009,of the most strongly marked domestic varieties could not possibly live
2009,in a wild state. In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock
2009,"was, and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion"
2009,"had ensued. It would be necessary, in order to prevent the effects of"
2009,"intercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in"
2009,"its new home. Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally"
2009,"revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me"
2009,"not improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to"
2009,"cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance,"
2009,"of the cabbage, in very poor soil--in which case, however, some"
2009,effect would have to be attributed to the DEFINITE action of the poor
2009,"soil--that they would, to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the"
2009,wild aboriginal stock. Whether or not the experiment would succeed is
2009,not of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment
2009,itself the conditions of life are changed. If it could be shown that our
2009,"domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion--that is,"
2009,"to lose their acquired characters, while kept under the same conditions"
2009,"and while kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might"
2009,"check, by blending together, any slight deviations in their structure,"
2009,"in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic"
2009,varieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow of evidence
2009,in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart
2009,"and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various"
2009,"breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an unlimited number of generations,"
2009,would be opposed to all experience.
2009,
2009,CHARACTER OF DOMESTIC VARIETIES; DIFFICULTY OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN
2009,VARIETIES AND SPECIES; ORIGIN OF DOMESTIC VARIETIES FROM ONE OR MORE
2009,SPECIES.
2009,
2009,When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic
2009,"animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we"
2009,"generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less"
2009,uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races often
2009,"have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although"
2009,"differing from each other and from other species of the same genus, in"
2009,"several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in"
2009,"some one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially"
2009,when compared with the species under nature to which they are nearest
2009,allied. With these exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of
2009,"varieties when crossed--a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic"
2009,races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as
2009,"do the closely allied species of the same genus in a state of nature,"
2009,but the differences in most cases are less in degree. This must be
2009,"admitted as true, for the domestic races of many animals and plants have"
2009,been ranked by some competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally
2009,"distinct species, and by other competent judges as mere varieties."
2009,If any well marked distinction existed between a domestic race and a
2009,"species, this source of doubt would not so perpetually recur. It has"
2009,often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in
2009,characters of generic value. It can be shown that this statement is not
2009,correct; but naturalists differ much in determining what characters are
2009,of generic value; all such valuations being at present empirical. When
2009,"it is explained how genera originate under nature, it will be seen that"
2009,we have no right to expect often to find a generic amount of difference
2009,in our domesticated races.
2009,
2009,In attempting to estimate the amount of structural difference between
2009,"allied domestic races, we are soon involved in doubt, from not knowing"
2009,whether they are descended from one or several parent species. This
2009,"point, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for"
2009,"instance, it could be shown that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier,"
2009,"spaniel and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind truly, were"
2009,"the offspring of any single species, then such facts would have great"
2009,weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many closely
2009,"allied natural species--for instance, of the many foxes--inhabiting the"
2009,"different quarters of the world. I do not believe, as we shall presently"
2009,"see, that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of"
2009,the dog has been produced under domestication; I believe that a small
2009,part of the difference is due to their being descended from distinct
2009,species. In the case of strongly marked races of some other domesticated
2009,"species, there is presumptive or even strong evidence that all are"
2009,descended from a single wild stock.
2009,
2009,It has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals
2009,"and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and"
2009,likewise to withstand diverse climates. I do not dispute that these
2009,capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated
2009,"productions; but how could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed"
2009,"an animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and whether"
2009,it would endure other climates? Has the little variability of the ass
2009,"and goose, or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer,"
2009,"or of cold by the common camel, prevented their domestication? I"
2009,"cannot doubt that if other animals and plants, equal in number to our"
2009,"domesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and"
2009,"countries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to breed"
2009,"for an equal number of generations under domestication, they would on"
2009,an average vary as largely as the parent species of our existing
2009,domesticated productions have varied.
2009,
2009,"In the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants,"
2009,"it is not possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they are"
2009,descended from one or several wild species. The argument mainly relied
2009,on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals
2009,"is, that we find in the most ancient times, on the monuments of Egypt,"
2009,"and in the lake-habitations of Switzerland, much diversity in the"
2009,"breeds; and that some of these ancient breeds closely resemble, or are"
2009,"even identical with, those still existing. But this only throws far"
2009,"backward the history of civilisation, and shows that animals were"
2009,domesticated at a much earlier period than has hitherto been supposed.
2009,The lake-inhabitants of Switzerland cultivated several kinds of wheat
2009,"and barley, the pea, the poppy for oil and flax; and they possessed"
2009,several domesticated animals. They also carried on commerce with other
2009,"nations. All this clearly shows, as Heer has remarked, that they had at"
2009,this early age progressed considerably in civilisation; and this again
2009,"implies a long continued previous period of less advanced civilisation,"
2009,"during which the domesticated animals, kept by different tribes in"
2009,"different districts, might have varied and given rise to distinct races."
2009,Since the discovery of flint tools in the superficial formations of many
2009,"parts of the world, all geologists believe that barbarian men existed at"
2009,an enormously remote period; and we know that at the present day there
2009,is hardly a tribe so barbarous as not to have domesticated at least the
2009,dog.
2009,
2009,The origin of most of our domestic animals will probably forever remain
2009,"vague. But I may here state that, looking to the domestic dogs of the"
2009,"whole world, I have, after a laborious collection of all known facts,"
2009,come to the conclusion that several wild species of Canidae have been
2009,"tamed, and that their blood, in some cases mingled together, flows in"
2009,the veins of our domestic breeds. In regard to sheep and goats I can
2009,"form no decided opinion. From facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth,"
2009,"on the habits, voice, constitution and structure of the humped Indian"
2009,"cattle, it is almost certain that they are descended from a different"
2009,aboriginal stock from our European cattle; and some competent judges
2009,"believe that these latter have had two or three wild progenitors,"
2009,"whether or not these deserve to be called species. This conclusion, as"
2009,well as that of the specific distinction between the humped and common
2009,"cattle, may, indeed, be looked upon as established by the admirable"
2009,"researches of Professor Rutimeyer. With respect to horses, from reasons"
2009,"which I cannot here give, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in"
2009,"opposition to several authors, that all the races belong to the same"
2009,"species. Having kept nearly all the English breeds of the fowl alive,"
2009,"having bred and crossed them, and examined their skeletons, it appears"
2009,to me almost certain that all are the descendants of the wild Indian
2009,"fowl, Gallus bankiva; and this is the conclusion of Mr. Blyth, and"
2009,of others who have studied this bird in India. In regard to ducks and
2009,"rabbits, some breeds of which differ much from each other, the evidence"
2009,is clear that they are all descended from the common duck and wild
2009,rabbit.
2009,
2009,The doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several
2009,"aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some"
2009,"authors. They believe that every race which breeds true, let the"
2009,"distinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype."
2009,At this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild
2009,"cattle, as many sheep, and several goats, in Europe alone, and several"
2009,even within Great Britain. One author believes that there formerly
2009,existed eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to Great Britain! When we
2009,"bear in mind that Britain has now not one peculiar mammal, and France"
2009,"but few distinct from those of Germany, and so with Hungary, Spain,"
2009,"etc., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds"
2009,"of cattle, sheep, etc., we must admit that many domestic breeds must"
2009,have originated in Europe; for whence otherwise could they have been
2009,derived? So it is in India. Even in the case of the breeds of the
2009,"domestic dog throughout the world, which I admit are descended from"
2009,"several wild species, it cannot be doubted that there has been an"
2009,immense amount of inherited variation; for who will believe that animals
2009,"closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound, the bull-dog,"
2009,"pug-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, etc.--so unlike all wild Canidae--ever"
2009,existed in a state of nature? It has often been loosely said that all
2009,our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few
2009,aboriginal species; but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree
2009,intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our several
2009,"domestic races by this process, we must admit the former existence of"
2009,"the most extreme forms, as the Italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog,"
2009,"etc., in the wild state. Moreover, the possibility of making distinct"
2009,races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated. Many cases are on record
2009,showing that a race may be modified by occasional crosses if aided
2009,by the careful selection of the individuals which present the desired
2009,character; but to obtain a race intermediate between two quite distinct
2009,races would be very difficult. Sir J. Sebright expressly experimented
2009,with this object and failed. The offspring from the first cross between
2009,two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found with
2009,"pigeons) quite uniform in character, and every thing seems simple"
2009,enough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several
2009,"generations, hardly two of them are alike, and then the difficulty of"
2009,the task becomes manifest.
2009,
2009,"BREEDS OF THE DOMESTIC PIGEON, THEIR DIFFERENCES AND ORIGIN."
2009,
2009,"Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have,"
2009,"after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons. I have kept every breed"
2009,"which I could purchase or obtain, and have been most kindly favoured"
2009,"with skins from several quarters of the world, more especially by the"
2009,"Hon. W. Elliot from India, and by the Hon. C. Murray from Persia. Many"
2009,"treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons, and"
2009,"some of them are very important, as being of considerable antiquity. I"
2009,"have associated with several eminent fanciers, and have been permitted"
2009,to join two of the London Pigeon Clubs. The diversity of the breeds is
2009,something astonishing. Compare the English carrier and the short-faced
2009,"tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing"
2009,"corresponding differences in their skulls. The carrier, more especially"
2009,"the male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the"
2009,"carunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly"
2009,"elongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a"
2009,wide gape of mouth. The short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost
2009,like that of a finch; and the common tumbler has the singular inherited
2009,"habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock, and tumbling in"
2009,"the air head over heels. The runt is a bird of great size, with long,"
2009,massive beak and large feet; some of the sub-breeds of runts have very
2009,"long necks, others very long wings and tails, others singularly short"
2009,"tails. The barb is allied to the carrier, but, instead of a long beak,"
2009,"has a very short and broad one. The pouter has a much elongated body,"
2009,"wings, and legs; and its enormously developed crop, which it glories in"
2009,"inflating, may well excite astonishment and even laughter. The turbit"
2009,"has a short and conical beak, with a line of reversed feathers down the"
2009,"breast; and it has the habit of continually expanding, slightly, the"
2009,upper part of the oesophagus. The Jacobin has the feathers so much
2009,"reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood, and it"
2009,"has, proportionally to its size, elongated wing and tail feathers. The"
2009,"trumpeter and laugher, as their names express, utter a very different"
2009,coo from the other breeds. The fantail has thirty or even forty
2009,"tail-feathers, instead of twelve or fourteen, the normal number in all"
2009,the members of the great pigeon family: these feathers are kept expanded
2009,and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch: the
2009,oil-gland is quite aborted. Several other less distinct breeds might be
2009,specified.
2009,
2009,"In the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones of"
2009,"the face, in length and breadth and curvature, differs enormously. The"
2009,"shape, as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw,"
2009,varies in a highly remarkable manner. The caudal and sacral vertebrae
2009,"vary in number; as does the number of the ribs, together with their"
2009,relative breadth and the presence of processes. The size and shape of
2009,the apertures in the sternum are highly variable; so is the degree
2009,of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula. The
2009,"proportional width of the gape of mouth, the proportional length of the"
2009,"eyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the tongue (not always in"
2009,"strict correlation with the length of beak), the size of the crop and"
2009,of the upper part of the oesophagus; the development and abortion of
2009,the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers; the
2009,relative length of the wing and tail to each other and to the body;
2009,the relative length of the leg and foot; the number of scutellae on
2009,"the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of"
2009,structure which are variable. The period at which the perfect plumage is
2009,"acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the nestling"
2009,birds are clothed when hatched. The shape and size of the eggs vary. The
2009,"manner of flight, and in some breeds the voice and disposition, differ"
2009,"remarkably. Lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females have come"
2009,to differ in a slight degree from each other.
2009,
2009,"Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which, if shown"
2009,"to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would"
2009,"certainly be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not"
2009,believe that any ornithologist would in this case place the English
2009,"carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and"
2009,fantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds
2009,"several truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species, as he would call them,"
2009,could be shown him.
2009,
2009,"Great as are the differences between the breeds of the pigeon, I am"
2009,"fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct,"
2009,"namely, that all are descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia),"
2009,"including under this term several geographical races or sub-species,"
2009,which differ from each other in the most trifling respects. As several
2009,of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree
2009,"applicable in other cases, I will here briefly give them. If the several"
2009,"breeds are not varieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon,"
2009,they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks;
2009,for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing
2009,"of any lesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced"
2009,by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent-stocks possessed the
2009,characteristic enormous crop? The supposed aboriginal stocks must all
2009,"have been rock-pigeons, that is, they did not breed or willingly perch"
2009,"on trees. But besides C. livia, with its geographical sub-species, only"
2009,two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have
2009,not any of the characters of the domestic breeds. Hence the supposed
2009,aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they
2009,"were originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and"
2009,"this, considering their size, habits and remarkable characters, seems"
2009,improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. But
2009,"birds breeding on precipices, and good flyers, are unlikely to be"
2009,"exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with"
2009,"the domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of the"
2009,"smaller British islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean. Hence the"
2009,supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with
2009,"the rock-pigeon seems a very rash assumption. Moreover, the several"
2009,above-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of
2009,"the world, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back"
2009,"again into their native country; but not one has become wild or feral,"
2009,"though the dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly"
2009,"altered state, has become feral in several places. Again, all recent"
2009,experience shows that it is difficult to get wild animals to breed
2009,freely under domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin
2009,"of our pigeons, it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species"
2009,"were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man,"
2009,as to be quite prolific under confinement.
2009,
2009,"An argument of great weight, and applicable in several other cases, is,"
2009,"that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally with the wild"
2009,"rock-pigeon in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts"
2009,"of their structure, yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts; we"
2009,may look in vain through the whole great family of Columbidae for a beak
2009,"like that of the English carrier, or that of the short-faced tumbler, or"
2009,barb; for reversed feathers like those of the Jacobin; for a crop like
2009,that of the pouter; for tail-feathers like those of the fantail. Hence
2009,"it must be assumed, not only that half-civilized man succeeded in"
2009,"thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or"
2009,"by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that"
2009,these very species have since all become extinct or unknown. So many
2009,strange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree.
2009,
2009,Some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve
2009,"consideration. The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, with white loins;"
2009,"but the Indian sub-species, C. intermedia of Strickland, has this"
2009,"part bluish. The tail has a terminal dark bar, with the outer feathers"
2009,externally edged at the base with white. The wings have two black bars.
2009,"Some semi-domestic breeds, and some truly wild breeds, have, besides the"
2009,"two black bars, the wings chequered with black. These several marks do"
2009,"not occur together in any other species of the whole family. Now, in"
2009,"every one of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all"
2009,"the above marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers,"
2009,"sometimes concur perfectly developed. Moreover, when birds belonging to"
2009,"two or more distinct breeds are crossed, none of which are blue or have"
2009,"any of the above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt"
2009,suddenly to acquire these characters. To give one instance out of
2009,"several which I have observed: I crossed some white fantails, which"
2009,"breed very true, with some black barbs--and it so happens that blue"
2009,varieties of barbs are so rare that I never heard of an instance in
2009,"England; and the mongrels were black, brown and mottled. I also crossed"
2009,"a barb with a spot, which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot"
2009,"on the forehead, and which notoriously breeds very true; the mongrels"
2009,were dusky and mottled. I then crossed one of the mongrel barb-fantails
2009,"with a mongrel barb-spot, and they produced a bird of as beautiful a"
2009,"blue colour, with the white loins, double black wing-bar, and barred and"
2009,"white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We can understand"
2009,"these facts, on the well-known principle of reversion to ancestral"
2009,"characters, if all the domestic breeds are descended from the"
2009,"rock-pigeon. But if we deny this, we must make one of the two following"
2009,"highly improbable suppositions. Either, first, that all the several"
2009,imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the
2009,"rock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus coloured and"
2009,"marked, so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to"
2009,"revert to the very same colours and markings. Or, secondly, that each"
2009,"breed, even the purest, has within a dozen, or at most within a score,"
2009,"of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen"
2009,"or twenty generations, for no instance is known of crossed descendants"
2009,"reverting to an ancestor of foreign blood, removed by a greater number"
2009,of generations. In a breed which has been crossed only once the tendency
2009,to revert to any character derived from such a cross will naturally
2009,"become less and less, as in each succeeding generation there will be"
2009,"less of the foreign blood; but when there has been no cross, and there"
2009,is a tendency in the breed to revert to a character which was lost
2009,"during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to"
2009,"the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite"
2009,number of generations. These two distinct cases of reversion are often
2009,confounded together by those who have written on inheritance.
2009,
2009,"Lastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the breeds of the"
2009,"pigeon are perfectly fertile, as I can state from my own observations,"
2009,"purposely made, on the most distinct breeds. Now, hardly any cases"
2009,have been ascertained with certainty of hybrids from two quite distinct
2009,species of animals being perfectly fertile. Some authors believe
2009,that long-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to
2009,"sterility in species. From the history of the dog, and of some other"
2009,"domestic animals, this conclusion is probably quite correct, if applied"
2009,to species closely related to each other. But to extend it so far as to
2009,"suppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers,"
2009,"pouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile,"
2009,"inter se, seems to me rash in the extreme."
2009,
2009,"From these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having"
2009,formerly made seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely
2009,under domestication--these supposed species being quite unknown in a
2009,"wild state, and their not having become anywhere feral--these species"
2009,"presenting certain very abnormal characters, as compared with all other"
2009,"Columbidae, though so like the rock-pigeon in most other respects--the"
2009,occasional reappearance of the blue colour and various black marks in
2009,"all the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed--and lastly, the"
2009,"mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile--from these several reasons,"
2009,"taken together, we may safely conclude that all our domestic breeds are"
2009,descended from the rock-pigeon or Columba livia with its geographical
2009,sub-species.
2009,
2009,"In favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that the wild C. livia has"
2009,been found capable of domestication in Europe and in India; and that it
2009,agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all
2009,"the domestic breeds. Secondly, that although an English carrier or a"
2009,short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the
2009,"rock-pigeon, yet that by comparing the several sub-breeds of these two"
2009,"races, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can"
2009,"make, between them and the rock-pigeon, an almost perfect series; so"
2009,"we can in some other cases, but not with all the breeds. Thirdly,"
2009,those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed are in each
2009,"eminently variable, for instance, the wattle and length of beak of"
2009,"the carrier, the shortness of that of the tumbler, and the number of"
2009,tail-feathers in the fantail; and the explanation of this fact will be
2009,"obvious when we treat of selection. Fourthly, pigeons have been watched"
2009,"and tended with the utmost care, and loved by many people. They have"
2009,been domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the
2009,world; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth Aegyptian
2009,"dynasty, about  B.C., as was pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius;"
2009,but Mr. Birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of fare in
2009,"the previous dynasty. In the time of the Romans, as we hear from Pliny,"
2009,"immense prices were given for pigeons; ""nay, they are come to this pass,"
2009,"that they can reckon up their pedigree and race."" Pigeons were much"
2009,"valued by Akber Khan in India, about the year ; never less than"
2009,", pigeons were taken with the court. ""The monarchs of Iran and"
2009,"Turan sent him some very rare birds;"" and, continues the courtly"
2009,"historian, ""His Majesty, by crossing the breeds, which method was never"
2009,"practised before, has improved them astonishingly."" About this same"
2009,period the Dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old Romans. The
2009,paramount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense
2009,"amount of variation which pigeons have undergone, will likewise be"
2009,"obvious when we treat of selection. We shall then, also, see how it is"
2009,that the several breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character.
2009,It is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct
2009,"breeds, that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life; and"
2009,thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary.
2009,
2009,"I have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some,"
2009,"yet quite insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and"
2009,"watched the several kinds, well knowing how truly they breed, I"
2009,felt fully as much difficulty in believing that since they had been
2009,"domesticated they had all proceeded from a common parent, as any"
2009,naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the
2009,"many species of finches, or other groups of birds, in nature. One"
2009,"circumstance has struck me much; namely, that nearly all the breeders of"
2009,"the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom"
2009,"I have conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly convinced"
2009,"that the several breeds to which each has attended, are descended"
2009,"from so many aboriginally distinct species. Ask, as I have asked, a"
2009,"celebrated raiser of Hereford cattle, whether his cattle might not have"
2009,"descended from Long-horns, or both from a common parent-stock, and he"
2009,"will laugh you to scorn. I have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or duck,"
2009,"or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main breed was"
2009,"descended from a distinct species. Van Mons, in his treatise on pears"
2009,"and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts,"
2009,"for instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have proceeded"
2009,from the seeds of the same tree. Innumerable other examples could be
2009,"given. The explanation, I think, is simple: from long-continued study"
2009,they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several
2009,"races; and though they well know that each race varies slightly, for"
2009,"they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they"
2009,"ignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight"
2009,differences accumulated during many successive generations. May not
2009,"those naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than"
2009,"does the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate"
2009,"links in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our domestic"
2009,races are descended from the same parents--may they not learn a lesson
2009,"of caution, when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature"
2009,being lineal descendants of other species?
2009,
2009,"PRINCIPLES OF SELECTION ANCIENTLY FOLLOWED, AND THEIR EFFECTS."
2009,
2009,Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been
2009,"produced, either from one or from several allied species. Some effect"
2009,may be attributed to the direct and definite action of the external
2009,"conditions of life, and some to habit; but he would be a bold man who"
2009,would account by such agencies for the differences between a dray and
2009,"race-horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon."
2009,One of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we
2009,"see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good,"
2009,but to man's use or fancy. Some variations useful to him have probably
2009,"arisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe"
2009,"that the fuller's teasel, with its hooks, which can not be rivalled by"
2009,"any mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and"
2009,this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. So it has
2009,probably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been
2009,the case with the ancon sheep. But when we compare the dray-horse and
2009,"race-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted"
2009,"either for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one"
2009,"breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for another"
2009,"purpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each good for man"
2009,"in different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so pertinacious in"
2009,"battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with ""everlasting"
2009,"layers"" which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and"
2009,"elegant; when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard,"
2009,"and flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different"
2009,"seasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we"
2009,"must, I think, look further than to mere variability. We can not suppose"
2009,that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as
2009,"we now see them; indeed, in many cases, we know that this has not been"
2009,their history. The key is man's power of accumulative selection: nature
2009,gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions
2009,useful to him. In this sense he may be said to have made for himself
2009,useful breeds.
2009,
2009,The great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical.
2009,"It is certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a"
2009,"single lifetime, modified to a large extent their breeds of cattle"
2009,and sheep. In order fully to realise what they have done it is almost
2009,"necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject,"
2009,and to inspect the animals. Breeders habitually speak of an animal's
2009,"organisation as something plastic, which they can model almost as they"
2009,please. If I had space I could quote numerous passages to this effect
2009,"from highly competent authorities. Youatt, who was probably better"
2009,acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other
2009,"individual, and who was himself a very good judge of animals, speaks of"
2009,"the principle of selection as ""that which enables the agriculturist, not"
2009,"only to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether."
2009,"It is the magician's wand, by means of which he may summon into life"
2009,"whatever form and mould he pleases."" Lord Somerville, speaking of"
2009,"what breeders have done for sheep, says: ""It would seem as if they had"
2009,"chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself, and then had given it"
2009,"existence."" In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in"
2009,"regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a"
2009,"trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture"
2009,"by a connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and"
2009,"the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best may"
2009,ultimately be selected for breeding.
2009,
2009,What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous
2009,prices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have been
2009,exported to almost every quarter of the world. The improvement is by no
2009,means generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders
2009,"are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes among closely"
2009,"allied sub-breeds. And when a cross has been made, the closest selection"
2009,is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If selection
2009,consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and breeding
2009,"from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth"
2009,notice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by
2009,"the accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of"
2009,differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye--differences
2009,which I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. Not one man in
2009,a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an
2009,"eminent breeder. If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his"
2009,"subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable"
2009,"perseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements; if he"
2009,"wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail. Few would readily"
2009,believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to
2009,become even a skilful pigeon-fancier.
2009,
2009,The same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations
2009,are here often more abrupt. No one supposes that our choicest
2009,productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal
2009,stock. We have proofs that this is not so in several cases in which
2009,"exact records have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance,"
2009,the steadily increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted.
2009,"We see an astonishing improvement in many florists' flowers, when the"
2009,flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only
2009,twenty or thirty years ago. When a race of plants is once pretty well
2009,"established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best plants, but"
2009,"merely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the ""rogues,"" as they call"
2009,the plants that deviate from the proper standard. With animals this kind
2009,"of selection is, in fact, likewise followed; for hardly any one is so"
2009,careless as to breed from his worst animals.
2009,
2009,"In regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated"
2009,"effects of selection--namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in"
2009,the different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the
2009,"diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the"
2009,"kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties;"
2009,"and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in"
2009,comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. See
2009,"how different the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the"
2009,"flowers; how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the"
2009,leaves; how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ
2009,"in size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very"
2009,slight differences. It is not that the varieties which differ largely
2009,in some one point do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly
2009,"ever--I speak after careful observation--perhaps never, the case. The"
2009,"law of correlated variation, the importance of which should never be"
2009,"overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general rule, it"
2009,"cannot be doubted that the continued selection of slight variations,"
2009,"either in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races"
2009,differing from each other chiefly in these characters.
2009,
2009,It may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to
2009,methodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century;
2009,"it has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises"
2009,"have been published on the subject; and the result has been, in a"
2009,"corresponding degree, rapid and important. But it is very far from"
2009,true that the principle is a modern discovery. I could give several
2009,"references to works of high antiquity, in which the full importance of"
2009,the principle is acknowledged. In rude and barbarous periods of English
2009,"history choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to"
2009,prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain
2009,"size was ordered, and this may be compared to the ""roguing"" of plants"
2009,by nurserymen. The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an
2009,ancient Chinese encyclopaedia. Explicit rules are laid down by some of
2009,"the Roman classical writers. From passages in Genesis, it is clear that"
2009,the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to.
2009,"Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to"
2009,"improve the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages"
2009,in Pliny. The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by
2009,"colour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs. Livingstone"
2009,states that good domestic breeds are highly valued by the negroes in the
2009,interior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans. Some of these
2009,"facts do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of"
2009,"domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now"
2009,"attended to by the lowest savages. It would, indeed, have been a strange"
2009,"fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of"
2009,good and bad qualities is so obvious.
2009,
2009,UNCONSCIOUS SELECTION.
2009,
2009,"At the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with"
2009,"a distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior"
2009,"to anything of the kind in the country. But, for our purpose, a form of"
2009,"selection, which may be called unconscious, and which results from every"
2009,"one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is"
2009,"more important. Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries"
2009,"to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best"
2009,"dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the"
2009,"breed. Nevertheless we may infer that this process, continued during"
2009,"centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as"
2009,"Bakewell, Collins, etc., by this very same process, only carried on more"
2009,"methodically, did greatly modify, even during their lifetimes, the forms"
2009,and qualities of their cattle. Slow and insensible changes of this kind
2009,could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings
2009,"of the breeds in question have been made long ago, which may serve for"
2009,"comparison. In some cases, however, unchanged, or but little changed,"
2009,"individuals of the same breed exist in less civilised districts, where"
2009,the breed has been less improved. There is reason to believe that King
2009,Charles' spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent
2009,since the time of that monarch. Some highly competent authorities are
2009,"convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and"
2009,has probably been slowly altered from it. It is known that the English
2009,"pointer has been greatly changed within the last century, and in this"
2009,"case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses"
2009,"with the foxhound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been"
2009,"effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually that,"
2009,"though the old Spanish pointer certainly came from Spain, Mr. Borrow"
2009,"has not seen, as I am informed by him, any native dog in Spain like our"
2009,pointer.
2009,
2009,"By a similar process of selection, and by careful training, English"
2009,"race-horses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent Arabs,"
2009,"so that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races, are"
2009,favoured in the weights which they carry. Lord Spencer and others have
2009,shown how the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early
2009,"maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this country. By"
2009,comparing the accounts given in various old treatises of the former
2009,"and present state of carrier and tumbler pigeons in Britain, India,"
2009,"and Persia, we can trace the stages through which they have insensibly"
2009,"passed, and come to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon."
2009,
2009,Youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of
2009,"selection which may be considered as unconscious, in so far that the"
2009,"breeders could never have expected, or even wished, to produce the"
2009,"result which ensued--namely, the production of the distinct strains. The"
2009,"two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as"
2009,"Mr. Youatt remarks, ""Have been purely bred from the original stock"
2009,of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a suspicion
2009,existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that
2009,the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the
2009,"pure blood of Mr. Bakewell's flock, and yet the difference between the"
2009,sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the
2009,"appearance of being quite different varieties."""
2009,
2009,If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited
2009,"character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal"
2009,"particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully"
2009,"preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are"
2009,"so liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more"
2009,offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a
2009,kind of unconscious selection going on. We see the value set on animals
2009,"even by the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and"
2009,"devouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value than"
2009,their dogs.
2009,
2009,In plants the same gradual process of improvement through the occasional
2009,"preservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently"
2009,"distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties,"
2009,and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended
2009,"together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size"
2009,"and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose,"
2009,"pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the older"
2009,varieties or with their parent-stocks. No one would ever expect to get
2009,a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant. No one
2009,would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the seed of a wild
2009,"pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it"
2009,"had come from a garden-stock. The pear, though cultivated in classical"
2009,"times, appears, from Pliny's description, to have been a fruit of very"
2009,inferior quality. I have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural
2009,works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in having produced such
2009,"splendid results from such poor materials; but the art has been simple,"
2009,"and, as far as the final result is concerned, has been followed almost"
2009,unconsciously. It has consisted in always cultivating the best known
2009,"variety, sowing its seeds, and, when a slightly better variety chanced"
2009,"to appear, selecting it, and so onwards. But the gardeners of the"
2009,"classical period, who cultivated the best pears which they could"
2009,"procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we"
2009,owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their having naturally
2009,chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find.
2009,
2009,"A large amount of change, thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated,"
2009,"explains, as I believe, the well-known fact, that in a number of cases"
2009,"we cannot recognise, and therefore do not know, the wild parent-stocks"
2009,of the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and
2009,kitchen gardens. If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to
2009,improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of
2009,"usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia,"
2009,"the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite"
2009,"uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is"
2009,"not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance"
2009,"possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native"
2009,plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard
2009,of perfection comparable with that acquired by the plants in countries
2009,anciently civilised.
2009,
2009,"In regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should"
2009,not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their
2009,"own food, at least during certain seasons. And in two countries very"
2009,"differently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having"
2009,"slightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed"
2009,"better in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of"
2009,"""natural selection,"" as will hereafter be more fully explained, two"
2009,"sub-breeds might be formed. This, perhaps, partly explains why the"
2009,"varieties kept by savages, as has been remarked by some authors,"
2009,have more of the character of true species than the varieties kept in
2009,civilised countries.
2009,
2009,On the view here given of the important part which selection by man has
2009,"played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races"
2009,show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's wants
2009,"or fancies. We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal"
2009,"character of our domestic races, and likewise their differences being so"
2009,"great in external characters, and relatively so slight in internal parts"
2009,"or organs. Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any"
2009,deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and
2009,indeed he rarely cares for what is internal. He can never act by
2009,"selection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some"
2009,slight degree by nature. No man would ever try to make a fantail till he
2009,saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual
2009,"manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual"
2009,size; and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first
2009,"appeared, the more likely it would be to catch his attention. But to use"
2009,"such an expression as trying to make a fantail is, I have no doubt, in"
2009,"most cases, utterly incorrect. The man who first selected a pigeon"
2009,"with a slightly larger tail, never dreamed what the descendants of"
2009,"that pigeon would become through long-continued, partly unconscious and"
2009,"partly methodical, selection. Perhaps the parent bird of all fantails"
2009,"had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present Java"
2009,"fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in which as"
2009,many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted. Perhaps the first
2009,pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now
2009,does the upper part of its oesophagus--a habit which is disregarded by
2009,"all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the breed."
2009,
2009,Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would
2009,be necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small
2009,"differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however"
2009,"slight, in one's own possession. Nor must the value which would formerly"
2009,have been set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same
2009,"species, be judged of by the value which is now set on them, after"
2009,several breeds have fairly been established. It is known that with
2009,"pigeons many slight variations now occasionally appear, but these are"
2009,rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection in
2009,each breed. The common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties;
2009,"hence the Toulouse and the common breed, which differ only in colour,"
2009,"that most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct"
2009,at our poultry-shows.
2009,
2009,"These views appear to explain what has sometimes been noticed, namely,"
2009,that we know hardly anything about the origin or history of any of our
2009,"domestic breeds. But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language,"
2009,can hardly be said to have a distinct origin. A man preserves and breeds
2009,"from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes"
2009,"more care than usual in matching his best animals, and thus improves"
2009,"them, and the improved animals slowly spread in the immediate"
2009,"neighbourhood. But they will as yet hardly have a distinct name,"
2009,"and from being only slightly valued, their history will have been"
2009,"disregarded. When further improved by the same slow and gradual process,"
2009,"they will spread more widely, and will be recognised as something"
2009,"distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial"
2009,"name. In semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the"
2009,spreading of a new sub-breed will be a slow process. As soon as the
2009,"points of value are once acknowledged, the principle, as I have called"
2009,"it, of unconscious selection will always tend--perhaps more at one"
2009,"period than at another, as the breed rises or falls in fashion--perhaps"
2009,"more in one district than in another, according to the state of"
2009,civilisation of the inhabitants--slowly to add to the characteristic
2009,"features of the breed, whatever they may be. But the chance will be"
2009,"infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow,"
2009,"varying, and insensible changes."
2009,
2009,CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE TO MAN'S POWER OF SELECTION.
2009,
2009,"I will now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable or the"
2009,"reverse, to man's power of selection. A high degree of variability is"
2009,"obviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to"
2009,"work on; not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient,"
2009,"with extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount"
2009,of modification in almost any desired direction. But as variations
2009,"manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the"
2009,chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of
2009,individuals being kept. Hence number is of the highest importance for
2009,"success. On this principle Marshall formerly remarked, with respect"
2009,"to the sheep of part of Yorkshire, ""As they generally belong to poor"
2009,"people, and are mostly IN SMALL LOTS, they never can be improved."" On"
2009,"the other hand, nurserymen, from keeping large stocks of the same plant,"
2009,are generally far more successful than amateurs in raising new and
2009,valuable varieties. A large number of individuals of an animal or
2009,plant can be reared only where the conditions for its propagation are
2009,favourable. When the individuals are scanty all will be allowed to
2009,"breed, whatever their quality may be, and this will effectually prevent"
2009,selection. But probably the most important element is that the animal or
2009,"plant should be so highly valued by man, that the closest attention is"
2009,paid to even the slightest deviations in its qualities or structure.
2009,Unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected. I have seen it
2009,"gravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began"
2009,to vary just when gardeners began to attend to this plant. No doubt the
2009,"strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight"
2009,"varieties had been neglected. As soon, however, as gardeners picked out"
2009,"individual plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and"
2009,"raised seedlings from them, and again picked out the best seedlings and"
2009,"bred from them, then (with some aid by crossing distinct species)"
2009,those many admirable varieties of the strawberry were raised which have
2009,appeared during the last half-century.
2009,
2009,"With animals, facility in preventing crosses is an important element"
2009,"in the formation of new races--at least, in a country which is already"
2009,stocked with other races. In this respect enclosure of the land plays a
2009,part. Wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess
2009,"more than one breed of the same species. Pigeons can be mated for life,"
2009,"and this is a great convenience to the fancier, for thus many races may"
2009,"be improved and kept true, though mingled in the same aviary; and this"
2009,circumstance must have largely favoured the formation of new breeds.
2009,"Pigeons, I may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at a very"
2009,"quick rate, and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed"
2009,"they serve for food. On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal"
2009,"rambling habits, can not be easily matched, and, although so much valued"
2009,"by women and children, we rarely see a distinct breed long kept up; such"
2009,breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other
2009,country. Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less
2009,"than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat,"
2009,"the donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may be attributed in main part"
2009,"to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the"
2009,"difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by"
2009,"poor people, and little attention paid to their breeding; for recently"
2009,in certain parts of Spain and of the United States this animal has been
2009,"surprisingly modified and improved by careful selection; in peacocks,"
2009,"from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese,"
2009,"from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more"
2009,especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct
2009,"breeds; but the goose, under the conditions to which it is exposed when"
2009,"domesticated, seems to have a singularly inflexible organisation, though"
2009,"it has varied to a slight extent, as I have elsewhere described."
2009,
2009,Some authors have maintained that the amount of variation in our
2009,"domestic productions is soon reached, and can never afterward be"
2009,exceeded. It would be somewhat rash to assert that the limit has been
2009,attained in any one case; for almost all our animals and plants have
2009,been greatly improved in many ways within a recent period; and this
2009,implies variation. It would be equally rash to assert that characters
2009,"now increased to their utmost limit, could not, after remaining fixed"
2009,"for many centuries, again vary under new conditions of life. No doubt,"
2009,"as Mr. Wallace has remarked with much truth, a limit will be at last"
2009,"reached. For instance, there must be a limit to the fleetness of any"
2009,"terrestrial animal, as this will be determined by the friction to"
2009,"be overcome, the weight of the body to be carried, and the power of"
2009,contraction in the muscular fibres. But what concerns us is that the
2009,domestic varieties of the same species differ from each other in almost
2009,"every character, which man has attended to and selected, more than do"
2009,the distinct species of the same genera. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire
2009,"has proved this in regard to size, and so it is with colour, and"
2009,"probably with the length of hair. With respect to fleetness, which"
2009,"depends on many bodily characters, Eclipse was far fleeter, and"
2009,"a dray-horse is comparably stronger, than any two natural species"
2009,"belonging to the same genus. So with plants, the seeds of the different"
2009,varieties of the bean or maize probably differ more in size than do the
2009,seeds of the distinct species in any one genus in the same two families.
2009,The same remark holds good in regard to the fruit of the several
2009,"varieties of the plum, and still more strongly with the melon, as well"
2009,as in many other analogous cases.
2009,
2009,To sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants.
2009,Changed conditions of life are of the highest importance in causing
2009,"variability, both by acting directly on the organisation, and"
2009,indirectly by affecting the reproductive system. It is not probable
2009,"that variability is an inherent and necessary contingent, under all"
2009,circumstances. The greater or less force of inheritance and reversion
2009,determine whether variations shall endure. Variability is governed
2009,"by many unknown laws, of which correlated growth is probably the most"
2009,"important. Something, but how much we do not know, may be attributed to"
2009,"the definite action of the conditions of life. Some, perhaps a great,"
2009,effect may be attributed to the increased use or disuse of parts. The
2009,final result is thus rendered infinitely complex. In some cases the
2009,intercrossing of aboriginally distinct species appears to have played
2009,an important part in the origin of our breeds. When several breeds have
2009,"once been formed in any country, their occasional intercrossing, with"
2009,"the aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation"
2009,of new sub-breeds; but the importance of crossing has been much
2009,"exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which are"
2009,propagated by seed. With plants which are temporarily propagated by
2009,"cuttings, buds, etc., the importance of crossing is immense; for the"
2009,cultivator may here disregard the extreme variability both of hybrids
2009,"and of mongrels, and the sterility of hybrids; but plants not propagated"
2009,"by seed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only"
2009,"temporary. Over all these causes of change, the accumulative action of"
2009,"selection, whether applied methodically and quickly, or unconsciously"
2009,"and slowly, but more efficiently, seems to have been the predominant"
2009,power.

2009,CHAPTER II. VARIATION UNDER NATURE.
2009,
2009," Variability--Individual differences--Doubtful species--Wide ranging,"
2009," much diffused, and common species, vary most--Species of the larger"
2009, genera in each country vary more frequently than the species of the
2009, smaller genera--Many of the species of the larger genera resemble
2009," varieties in being very closely, but unequally, related to each other,"
2009, and in having restricted ranges.
2009,
2009,
2009,Before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic
2009,"beings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether these"
2009,"latter are subject to any variation. To treat this subject properly, a"
2009,long catalogue of dry facts ought to be given; but these I shall reserve
2009,for a future work. Nor shall I here discuss the various definitions
2009,which have been given of the term species. No one definition has
2009,satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what
2009,he means when he speaks of a species. Generally the term includes the
2009,"unknown element of a distinct act of creation. The term ""variety"" is"
2009,almost equally difficult to define; but here community of descent is
2009,"almost universally implied, though it can rarely be proved. We have also"
2009,what are called monstrosities; but they graduate into varieties. By a
2009,"monstrosity I presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure,"
2009,"generally injurious, or not useful to the species. Some authors use"
2009,"the term ""variation"" in a technical sense, as implying a modification"
2009,"directly due to the physical conditions of life; and ""variations"" in"
2009,this sense are supposed not to be inherited; but who can say that the
2009,"dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish waters of the Baltic, or"
2009,"dwarfed plants on Alpine summits, or the thicker fur of an animal from"
2009,"far northwards, would not in some cases be inherited for at least a few"
2009,generations? And in this case I presume that the form would be called a
2009,variety.
2009,
2009,It may be doubted whether sudden and considerable deviations of
2009,"structure, such as we occasionally see in our domestic productions, more"
2009,"especially with plants, are ever permanently propagated in a state"
2009,of nature. Almost every part of every organic being is so beautifully
2009,related to its complex conditions of life that it seems as improbable
2009,"that any part should have been suddenly produced perfect, as that a"
2009,complex machine should have been invented by man in a perfect state.
2009,Under domestication monstrosities sometimes occur which resemble normal
2009,structures in widely different animals. Thus pigs have occasionally been
2009,"born with a sort of proboscis, and if any wild species of the same genus"
2009,"had naturally possessed a proboscis, it might have been argued that this"
2009,"had appeared as a monstrosity; but I have as yet failed to find, after"
2009,"diligent search, cases of monstrosities resembling normal structures in"
2009,"nearly allied forms, and these alone bear on the question. If monstrous"
2009,forms of this kind ever do appear in a state of nature and are capable
2009,"of reproduction (which is not always the case), as they occur rarely"
2009,"and singly, their preservation would depend on unusually favourable"
2009,"circumstances. They would, also, during the first and succeeding"
2009,"generations cross with the ordinary form, and thus their abnormal"
2009,character would almost inevitably be lost. But I shall have to return
2009,in a future chapter to the preservation and perpetuation of single or
2009,occasional variations.
2009,
2009,INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES.
2009,
2009,The many slight differences which appear in the offspring from the
2009,"same parents, or which it may be presumed have thus arisen, from being"
2009,observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same
2009,"confined locality, may be called individual differences. No one supposes"
2009,that all the individuals of the same species are cast in the same actual
2009,mould. These individual differences are of the highest importance for
2009,"us, for they are often inherited, as must be familiar to every one;"
2009,and they thus afford materials for natural selection to act on and
2009,"accumulate, in the same manner as man accumulates in any given direction"
2009,individual differences in his domesticated productions. These individual
2009,differences generally affect what naturalists consider unimportant
2009,"parts; but I could show, by a long catalogue of facts, that parts"
2009,"which must be called important, whether viewed under a physiological or"
2009,"classificatory point of view, sometimes vary in the individuals of the"
2009,same species. I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist
2009,"would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in"
2009,"important parts of structure, which he could collect on good authority,"
2009,"as I have collected, during a course of years. It should be remembered"
2009,that systematists are far from being pleased at finding variability
2009,"in important characters, and that there are not many men who will"
2009,"laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in"
2009,many specimens of the same species. It would never have been expected
2009,that the branching of the main nerves close to the great central
2009,ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same species;
2009,it might have been thought that changes of this nature could have been
2009,effected only by slow degrees; yet Sir J. Lubbock has shown a degree of
2009,"variability in these main nerves in Coccus, which may almost be compared"
2009,to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree. This philosophical
2009,"naturalist, I may add, has also shown that the muscles in the larvae"
2009,of certain insects are far from uniform. Authors sometimes argue in a
2009,circle when they state that important organs never vary; for these
2009,same authors practically rank those parts as important (as some few
2009,"naturalists have honestly confessed) which do not vary; and, under"
2009,"this point of view, no instance will ever be found of an important part"
2009,varying; but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can
2009,be given.
2009,
2009,There is one point connected with individual differences which is
2009,extremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have been called
2009,"""protean"" or ""polymorphic,"" in which species present an inordinate"
2009,"amount of variation. With respect to many of these forms, hardly two"
2009,naturalists agree whether to rank them as species or as varieties. We
2009,"may instance Rubus, Rosa, and Hieracium among plants, several genera of"
2009,"insects, and of Brachiopod shells. In most polymorphic genera some"
2009,of the species have fixed and definite characters. Genera which
2009,"are polymorphic in one country seem to be, with a few exceptions,"
2009,"polymorphic in other countries, and likewise, judging from Brachiopod"
2009,"shells, at former periods of time. These facts are very perplexing, for"
2009,they seem to show that this kind of variability is independent of the
2009,"conditions of life. I am inclined to suspect that we see, at least in"
2009,"some of these polymorphic genera, variations which are of no service or"
2009,"disservice to the species, and which consequently have not been seized"
2009,"on and rendered definite by natural selection, as hereafter to be"
2009,explained.
2009,
2009,"Individuals of the same species often present, as is known to every one,"
2009,"great differences of structure, independently of variation, as in the"
2009,"two sexes of various animals, in the two or three castes of sterile"
2009,"females or workers among insects, and in the immature and larval states"
2009,"of many of the lower animals. There are, also, cases of dimorphism and"
2009,"trimorphism, both with animals and plants. Thus, Mr. Wallace, who has"
2009,"lately called attention to the subject, has shown that the females of"
2009,"certain species of butterflies, in the Malayan Archipelago, regularly"
2009,"appear under two or even three conspicuously distinct forms, not"
2009,connected by intermediate varieties. Fritz Muller has described
2009,analogous but more extraordinary cases with the males of certain
2009,"Brazilian Crustaceans: thus, the male of a Tanais regularly occurs"
2009,under two distinct forms; one of these has strong and differently shaped
2009,"pincers, and the other has antennae much more abundantly furnished with"
2009,"smelling-hairs. Although in most of these cases, the two or three forms,"
2009,"both with animals and plants, are not now connected by intermediate"
2009,"gradations, it is possible that they were once thus connected. Mr."
2009,"Wallace, for instance, describes a certain butterfly which presents in"
2009,the same island a great range of varieties connected by intermediate
2009,"links, and the extreme links of the chain closely resemble the two forms"
2009,of an allied dimorphic species inhabiting another part of the Malay
2009,"Archipelago. Thus also with ants, the several worker-castes are"
2009,"generally quite distinct; but in some cases, as we shall hereafter see,"
2009,the castes are connected together by finely graduated varieties. So it
2009,"is, as I have myself observed, with some dimorphic plants. It certainly"
2009,at first appears a highly remarkable fact that the same female butterfly
2009,should have the power of producing at the same time three distinct
2009,female forms and a male; and that an hermaphrodite plant should produce
2009,"from the same seed-capsule three distinct hermaphrodite forms, bearing"
2009,three different kinds of females and three or even six different kinds
2009,of males. Nevertheless these cases are only exaggerations of the common
2009,fact that the female produces offspring of two sexes which sometimes
2009,differ from each other in a wonderful manner.
2009,
2009,DOUBTFUL SPECIES.
2009,
2009,The forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of
2009,"species, but which are so closely similar to other forms, or are so"
2009,"closely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do"
2009,"not like to rank them as distinct species, are in several respects the"
2009,most important for us. We have every reason to believe that many of
2009,these doubtful and closely allied forms have permanently retained their
2009,"characters for a long time; for as long, as far as we know, as have good"
2009,"and true species. Practically, when a naturalist can unite by means of"
2009,"intermediate links any two forms, he treats the one as a variety of the"
2009,"other, ranking the most common, but sometimes the one first described"
2009,"as the species, and the other as the variety. But cases of great"
2009,"difficulty, which I will not here enumerate, sometimes arise in deciding"
2009,"whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another, even when"
2009,they are closely connected by intermediate links; nor will the commonly
2009,assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate forms always remove the
2009,"difficulty. In very many cases, however, one form is ranked as a variety"
2009,"of another, not because the intermediate links have actually been found,"
2009,but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they do
2009,"now somewhere exist, or may formerly have existed; and here a wide door"
2009,for the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened.
2009,
2009,"Hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or"
2009,"a variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide"
2009,"experience seems the only guide to follow. We must, however, in many"
2009,"cases, decide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked and"
2009,well-known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species
2009,by at least some competent judges.
2009,
2009,That varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be
2009,"disputed. Compare the several floras of Great Britain, of France, or"
2009,"of the United States, drawn up by different botanists, and see what"
2009,a surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good
2009,"species, and by another as mere varieties. Mr. H.C. Watson, to whom I"
2009,"lie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds, has marked for"
2009,"me  British plants, which are generally considered as varieties, but"
2009,which have all been ranked by botanists as species; and in making this
2009,"list he has omitted many trifling varieties, but which nevertheless have"
2009,"been ranked by some botanists as species, and he has entirely omitted"
2009,"several highly polymorphic genera. Under genera, including the most"
2009,"polymorphic forms, Mr. Babington gives  species, whereas Mr. Bentham"
2009,gives only --a difference of  doubtful forms! Among animals which
2009,"unite for each birth, and which are highly locomotive, doubtful forms,"
2009,"ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety, can"
2009,"rarely be found within the same country, but are common in separated"
2009,"areas. How many of the birds and insects in North America and Europe,"
2009,"which differ very slightly from each other, have been ranked by one"
2009,"eminent naturalist as undoubted species, and by another as varieties,"
2009,"or, as they are often called, geographical races! Mr. Wallace, in"
2009,"several valuable papers on the various animals, especially on the"
2009,"Lepidoptera, inhabiting the islands of the great Malayan Archipelago,"
2009,"shows that they may be classed under four heads, namely, as variable"
2009,"forms, as local forms, as geographical races or sub-species, and as true"
2009,representative species. The first or variable forms vary much within the
2009,limits of the same island. The local forms are moderately constant and
2009,distinct in each separate island; but when all from the several islands
2009,"are compared together, the differences are seen to be so slight and"
2009,"graduated that it is impossible to define or describe them, though"
2009,at the same time the extreme forms are sufficiently distinct. The
2009,geographical races or sub-species are local forms completely fixed and
2009,isolated; but as they do not differ from each other by strongly marked
2009,"and important characters, ""There is no possible test but individual"
2009,opinion to determine which of them shall be considered as species and
2009,"which as varieties."" Lastly, representative species fill the same"
2009,place in the natural economy of each island as do the local forms and
2009,sub-species; but as they are distinguished from each other by a greater
2009,"amount of difference than that between the local forms and sub-species,"
2009,they are almost universally ranked by naturalists as true species.
2009,"Nevertheless, no certain criterion can possibly be given by which"
2009,"variable forms, local forms, sub species and representative species can"
2009,be recognised.
2009,
2009,"Many years ago, when comparing, and seeing others compare, the birds"
2009,"from the closely neighbouring islands of the Galapagos Archipelago,"
2009,"one with another, and with those from the American mainland, I was"
2009,much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between
2009,species and varieties. On the islets of the little Madeira group there
2009,are many insects which are characterized as varieties in Mr. Wollaston's
2009,"admirable work, but which would certainly be ranked as distinct species"
2009,"by many entomologists. Even Ireland has a few animals, now generally"
2009,"regarded as varieties, but which have been ranked as species by some"
2009,zoologists. Several experienced ornithologists consider our British red
2009,"grouse as only a strongly marked race of a Norwegian species, whereas"
2009,the greater number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to Great
2009,Britain. A wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads
2009,"many naturalists to rank them as distinct species; but what distance, it"
2009,"has been well asked, will suffice if that between America and Europe"
2009,"is ample, will that between Europe and the Azores, or Madeira, or the"
2009,"Canaries, or between the several islets of these small archipelagos, be"
2009,sufficient?
2009,
2009,"Mr. B.D. Walsh, a distinguished entomologist of the United States, has"
2009,described what he calls Phytophagic varieties and Phytophagic species.
2009,Most vegetable-feeding insects live on one kind of plant or on one
2009,"group of plants; some feed indiscriminately on many kinds, but do not"
2009,"in consequence vary. In several cases, however, insects found living on"
2009,"different plants, have been observed by Mr. Walsh to present in their"
2009,"larval or mature state, or in both states, slight, though constant"
2009,"differences in colour, size, or in the nature of their secretions."
2009,"In some instances the males alone, in other instances, both males and"
2009,"females, have been observed thus to differ in a slight degree. When the"
2009,"differences are rather more strongly marked, and when both sexes and"
2009,"all ages are affected, the forms are ranked by all entomologists as good"
2009,"species. But no observer can determine for another, even if he can do so"
2009,"for himself, which of these Phytophagic forms ought to be called species"
2009,and which varieties. Mr. Walsh ranks the forms which it may be supposed
2009,"would freely intercross, as varieties; and those which appear to have"
2009,"lost this power, as species. As the differences depend on the insects"
2009,"having long fed on distinct plants, it cannot be expected that"
2009,intermediate links connecting the several forms should now be found.
2009,The naturalist thus loses his best guide in determining whether to rank
2009,doubtful forms as varieties or species. This likewise necessarily occurs
2009,"with closely allied organisms, which inhabit distinct continents or"
2009,"islands. When, on the other hand, an animal or plant ranges over the"
2009,"same continent, or inhabits many islands in the same archipelago, and"
2009,"presents different forms in the different areas, there is always a"
2009,good chance that intermediate forms will be discovered which will link
2009,together the extreme states; and these are then degraded to the rank of
2009,varieties.
2009,
2009,Some few naturalists maintain that animals never present varieties; but
2009,then these same naturalists rank the slightest difference as of specific
2009,value; and when the same identical form is met with in two distant
2009,"countries, or in two geological formations, they believe that two"
2009,distinct species are hidden under the same dress. The term species thus
2009,"comes to be a mere useless abstraction, implying and assuming a separate"
2009,"act of creation. It is certain that many forms, considered by highly"
2009,"competent judges to be varieties, resemble species so completely in"
2009,character that they have been thus ranked by other highly competent
2009,judges. But to discuss whether they ought to be called species or
2009,"varieties, before any definition of these terms has been generally"
2009,"accepted, is vainly to beat the air."
2009,
2009,Many of the cases of strongly marked varieties or doubtful species well
2009,"deserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument, from"
2009,"geographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, etc., have"
2009,been brought to bear in the attempt to determine their rank; but space
2009,"does not here permit me to discuss them. Close investigation, in many"
2009,"cases, will no doubt bring naturalists to agree how to rank doubtful"
2009,forms. Yet it must be confessed that it is in the best known countries
2009,that we find the greatest number of them. I have been struck with the
2009,fact that if any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful
2009,"to man, or from any cause closely attracts his attention, varieties of"
2009,"it will almost universally be found recorded. These varieties, moreover,"
2009,"will often be ranked by some authors as species. Look at the common oak,"
2009,how closely it has been studied; yet a German author makes more than a
2009,"dozen species out of forms, which are almost universally considered"
2009,by other botanists to be varieties; and in this country the highest
2009,botanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the
2009,sessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or
2009,mere varieties.
2009,
2009,I may here allude to a remarkable memoir lately published by A. de
2009,"Candolle, on the oaks of the whole world. No one ever had more ample"
2009,"materials for the discrimination of the species, or could have worked on"
2009,them with more zeal and sagacity. He first gives in detail all the many
2009,"points of structure which vary in the several species, and estimates"
2009,numerically the relative frequency of the variations. He specifies above
2009,"a dozen characters which may be found varying even on the same branch,"
2009,"sometimes according to age or development, sometimes without any"
2009,"assignable reason. Such characters are not of course of specific value,"
2009,"but they are, as Asa Gray has remarked in commenting on this memoir,"
2009,such as generally enter into specific definitions. De Candolle then goes
2009,on to say that he gives the rank of species to the forms that differ by
2009,"characters never varying on the same tree, and never found connected"
2009,"by intermediate states. After this discussion, the result of so much"
2009,"labour, he emphatically remarks: ""They are mistaken, who repeat that the"
2009,"greater part of our species are clearly limited, and that the doubtful"
2009,"species are in a feeble minority. This seemed to be true, so long as"
2009,"a genus was imperfectly known, and its species were founded upon a few"
2009,"specimens, that is to say, were provisional. Just as we come to know"
2009,"them better, intermediate forms flow in, and doubts as to specific"
2009,"limits augment."" He also adds that it is the best known species which"
2009,present the greatest number of spontaneous varieties and sub-varieties.
2009,"Thus Quercus robur has twenty-eight varieties, all of which, excepting"
2009,"six, are clustered round three sub-species, namely Q. pedunculata,"
2009,sessiliflora and pubescens. The forms which connect these three
2009,"sub-species are comparatively rare; and, as Asa Gray again remarks, if"
2009,these connecting forms which are now rare were to become totally extinct
2009,the three sub-species would hold exactly the same relation to each other
2009,as do the four or five provisionally admitted species which closely
2009,"surround the typical Quercus robur. Finally, De Candolle admits that"
2009,"out of the  species, which will be enumerated in his Prodromus"
2009,"as belonging to the oak family, at least two-thirds are provisional"
2009,"species, that is, are not known strictly to fulfil the definition above"
2009,given of a true species. It should be added that De Candolle no longer
2009,"believes that species are immutable creations, but concludes that the"
2009,"derivative theory is the most natural one, ""and the most accordant with"
2009,"the known facts in palaeontology, geographical botany and zoology, of"
2009,"anatomical structure and classification."""
2009,
2009,When a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms
2009,quite unknown to him he is at first much perplexed in determining what
2009,differences to consider as specific and what as varietal; for he knows
2009,nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group is
2009,"subject; and this shows, at least, how very generally there is some"
2009,variation. But if he confine his attention to one class within one
2009,country he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful
2009,"forms. His general tendency will be to make many species, for he will"
2009,"become impressed, just like the pigeon or poultry fancier before alluded"
2009,"to, with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually"
2009,studying; and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation
2009,in other groups and in other countries by which to correct his first
2009,impressions. As he extends the range of his observations he will meet
2009,with more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a greater number of
2009,closely-allied forms. But if his observations be widely extended he
2009,will in the end generally be able to make up his own mind; but he will
2009,"succeed in this at the expense of admitting much variation, and the"
2009,truth of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists.
2009,When he comes to study allied forms brought from countries not now
2009,"continuous, in which case he cannot hope to find intermediate links,"
2009,"he will be compelled to trust almost entirely to analogy, and his"
2009,difficulties will rise to a climax.
2009,
2009,Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between
2009,"species and sub-species--that is, the forms which in the opinion of some"
2009,"naturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at, the rank of"
2009,"species; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or"
2009,between lesser varieties and individual differences. These differences
2009,blend into each other by an insensible series; and a series impresses
2009,the mind with the idea of an actual passage.
2009,
2009,"Hence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to the"
2009,"systematist, as of the highest importance for us, as being the first"
2009,step towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording
2009,in works on natural history. And I look at varieties which are in any
2009,"degree more distinct and permanent, as steps toward more strongly marked"
2009,"and permanent varieties; and at the latter, as leading to sub-species,"
2009,and then to species. The passage from one stage of difference to another
2009,"may, in many cases, be the simple result of the nature of the organism"
2009,and of the different physical conditions to which it has long been
2009,"exposed; but with respect to the more important and adaptive characters,"
2009,the passage from one stage of difference to another may be safely
2009,"attributed to the cumulative action of natural selection, hereafter"
2009,"to be explained, and to the effects of the increased use or disuse"
2009,of parts. A well-marked variety may therefore be called an incipient
2009,species; but whether this belief is justifiable must be judged by the
2009,weight of the various facts and considerations to be given throughout
2009,this work.
2009,
2009,It need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species attain
2009,"the rank of species. They may become extinct, or they may endure as"
2009,"varieties for very long periods, as has been shown to be the case by Mr."
2009,"Wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil land-shells in Madeira,"
2009,and with plants by Gaston de Saporta. If a variety were to flourish so
2009,"as to exceed in numbers the parent species, it would then rank as the"
2009,"species, and the species as the variety; or it might come to supplant"
2009,"and exterminate the parent species; or both might co-exist, and both"
2009,rank as independent species. But we shall hereafter return to this
2009,subject.
2009,
2009,From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species
2009,"as one arbitrarily given, for the sake of convenience, to a set"
2009,"of individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not"
2009,"essentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less"
2009,"distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again,"
2009,"in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied"
2009,"arbitrarily, for convenience sake."
2009,
2009,"WIDE-RANGING, MUCH DIFFUSED, AND COMMON SPECIES VARY MOST."
2009,
2009,"Guided by theoretical considerations, I thought that some interesting"
2009,results might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the
2009,"species which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several"
2009,well-worked floras. At first this seemed a simple task; but Mr. H.C.
2009,"Watson, to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance"
2009,"on this subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties, as"
2009,"did subsequently Dr. Hooker, even in stronger terms. I shall reserve for"
2009,"a future work the discussion of these difficulties, and the tables of"
2009,the proportional numbers of the varying species. Dr. Hooker permits me
2009,"to add that after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined"
2009,"the tables, he thinks that the following statements are fairly well"
2009,"established. The whole subject, however, treated as it necessarily here"
2009,"is with much brevity, is rather perplexing, and allusions cannot be"
2009,"avoided to the ""struggle for existence,"" ""divergence of character,"" and"
2009,"other questions, hereafter to be discussed."
2009,
2009,Alphonse de Candolle and others have shown that plants which have
2009,very wide ranges generally present varieties; and this might have been
2009,"expected, as they are exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as"
2009,"they come into competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far"
2009,more important circumstance) with different sets of organic beings. But
2009,"my tables further show that, in any limited country, the species which"
2009,"are the most common, that is abound most in individuals, and the species"
2009,which are most widely diffused within their own country (and this is a
2009,"different consideration from wide range, and to a certain extent from"
2009,"commonness), oftenest give rise to varieties sufficiently well-marked to"
2009,"have been recorded in botanical works. Hence it is the most flourishing,"
2009,"or, as they may be called, the dominant species--those which range"
2009,"widely, are the most diffused in their own country, and are the most"
2009,"numerous in individuals--which oftenest produce well-marked varieties,"
2009,"or, as I consider them, incipient species. And this, perhaps, might have"
2009,"been anticipated; for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree"
2009,"permanent, necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of"
2009,"the country, the species which are already dominant will be the most"
2009,"likely to yield offspring, which, though in some slight degree modified,"
2009,still inherit those advantages that enabled their parents to become
2009,"dominant over their compatriots. In these remarks on predominence, it"
2009,should be understood that reference is made only to the forms which come
2009,"into competition with each other, and more especially to the members"
2009,of the same genus or class having nearly similar habits of life. With
2009,"respect to the number of individuals or commonness of species, the"
2009,comparison of course relates only to the members of the same group. One
2009,of the higher plants may be said to be dominant if it be more numerous
2009,in individuals and more widely diffused than the other plants of the
2009,"same country, which live under nearly the same conditions. A plant of"
2009,this kind is not the less dominant because some conferva inhabiting
2009,the water or some parasitic fungus is infinitely more numerous in
2009,"individuals, and more widely diffused. But if the conferva or parasitic"
2009,"fungus exceeds its allies in the above respects, it will then be"
2009,dominant within its own class.
2009,
2009,SPECIES OF THE LARGER GENERA IN EACH COUNTRY VARY MORE FREQUENTLY THAN
2009,THE SPECIES OF THE SMALLER GENERA.
2009,
2009,"If the plants inhabiting a country as described in any Flora, be divided"
2009,"into two equal masses, all those in the larger genera (i.e., those"
2009,"including many species) being placed on one side, and all those in the"
2009,"smaller genera on the other side, the former will be found to include a"
2009,somewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant
2009,"species. This might have been anticipated, for the mere fact of many"
2009,"species of the same genus inhabiting any country, shows that there"
2009,is something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that country
2009,"favourable to the genus; and, consequently, we might have expected to"
2009,"have found in the larger genera, or those including many species, a"
2009,larger proportional number of dominant species. But so many causes tend
2009,"to obscure this result, that I am surprised that my tables show even a"
2009,small majority on the side of the larger genera. I will here allude
2009,to only two causes of obscurity. Fresh water and salt-loving plants
2009,"generally have very wide ranges and are much diffused, but this seems to"
2009,"be connected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them, and has"
2009,little or no relation to the size of the genera to which the species
2009,"belong. Again, plants low in the scale of organisation are generally"
2009,much more widely diffused than plants higher in the scale; and here
2009,again there is no close relation to the size of the genera. The cause of
2009,lowly-organised plants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter
2009,on Geographical Distribution.
2009,
2009,From looking at species as only strongly marked and well-defined
2009,"varieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera"
2009,"in each country would oftener present varieties, than the species of the"
2009,"smaller genera; for wherever many closely related species (i.e., species"
2009,"of the same genus) have been formed, many varieties or incipient species"
2009,"ought, as a general rule, to be now forming. Where many large trees"
2009,"grow, we expect to find saplings. Where many species of a genus have"
2009,"been formed through variation, circumstances have been favourable"
2009,for variation; and hence we might expect that the circumstances would
2009,"generally still be favourable to variation. On the other hand, if we"
2009,"look at each species as a special act of creation, there is no apparent"
2009,"reason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species,"
2009,than in one having few.
2009,
2009,To test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of
2009,"twelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into"
2009,"two nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side,"
2009,"and those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably"
2009,proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the
2009,"side of the larger genera presented varieties, than on the side of the"
2009,"smaller genera. Moreover, the species of the large genera which present"
2009,"any varieties, invariably present a larger average number of varieties"
2009,than do the species of the small genera. Both these results follow when
2009,"another division is made, and when all the least genera, with from only"
2009,"one to four species, are altogether excluded from the tables. These"
2009,facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only
2009,strongly marked and permanent varieties; for wherever many species of
2009,"the same genus have been formed, or where, if we may use the expression,"
2009,"the manufactory of species has been active, we ought generally to find"
2009,"the manufactory still in action, more especially as we have every reason"
2009,to believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one.
2009,And this certainly holds true if varieties be looked at as incipient
2009,"species; for my tables clearly show, as a general rule, that, wherever"
2009,"many species of a genus have been formed, the species of that genus"
2009,"present a number of varieties, that is, of incipient species, beyond the"
2009,"average. It is not that all large genera are now varying much, and are"
2009,"thus increasing in the number of their species, or that no small genera"
2009,"are now varying and increasing; for if this had been so, it would have"
2009,been fatal to my theory; inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small
2009,genera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size;
2009,"and that large genera have often come to their maxima, declined, and"
2009,"disappeared. All that we want to show is, that where many species of a"
2009,"genus have been formed, on an average many are still forming; and this"
2009,certainly holds good.
2009,
2009,MANY OF THE SPECIES INCLUDED WITHIN THE LARGER GENERA RESEMBLE VARIETIES
2009,"IN BEING VERY CLOSELY, BUT UNEQUALLY, RELATED TO EACH OTHER, AND IN"
2009,HAVING RESTRICTED RANGES.
2009,
2009,There are other relations between the species of large genera and their
2009,recorded varieties which deserve notice. We have seen that there is no
2009,infallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well-marked
2009,varieties; and when intermediate links have not been found between
2009,"doubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to a determination by"
2009,"the amount of difference between them, judging by analogy whether or not"
2009,the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of species. Hence
2009,the amount of difference is one very important criterion in settling
2009,whether two forms should be ranked as species or varieties. Now Fries
2009,"has remarked in regard to plants, and Westwood in regard to insects,"
2009,that in large genera the amount of difference between the species is
2009,often exceedingly small. I have endeavoured to test this numerically by
2009,"averages, and, as far as my imperfect results go, they confirm the view."
2009,"I have also consulted some sagacious and experienced observers,"
2009,"and, after deliberation, they concur in this view. In this respect,"
2009,"therefore, the species of the larger genera resemble varieties, more"
2009,than do the species of the smaller genera. Or the case may be put in
2009,"another way, and it may be said, that in the larger genera, in which a"
2009,number of varieties or incipient species greater than the average are
2009,"now manufacturing, many of the species already manufactured still to a"
2009,"certain extent resemble varieties, for they differ from each other by a"
2009,less than the usual amount of difference.
2009,
2009,"Moreover, the species of the larger genera are related to each other, in"
2009,the same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to
2009,each other. No naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are
2009,equally distinct from each other; they may generally be divided into
2009,"sub-genera, or sections, or lesser groups. As Fries has well remarked,"
2009,little groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around
2009,"other species. And what are varieties but groups of forms, unequally"
2009,"related to each other, and clustered round certain forms--that is, round"
2009,their parent-species. Undoubtedly there is one most important point of
2009,"difference between varieties and species, namely, that the amount of"
2009,"difference between varieties, when compared with each other or with"
2009,"their parent-species, is much less than that between the species of the"
2009,"same genus. But when we come to discuss the principle, as I call it, of"
2009,"divergence of character, we shall see how this may be explained, and"
2009,how the lesser differences between varieties tend to increase into the
2009,greater differences between species.
2009,
2009,There is one other point which is worth notice. Varieties generally have
2009,much restricted ranges. This statement is indeed scarcely more than a
2009,"truism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range than that of"
2009,"its supposed parent-species, their denominations would be reversed."
2009,But there is reason to believe that the species which are very closely
2009,"allied to other species, and in so far resemble varieties, often have"
2009,"much restricted ranges. For instance, Mr. H.C. Watson has marked for me"
2009,in the well-sifted London catalogue of Plants (th edition) sixty-three
2009,"plants which are therein ranked as species, but which he considers as"
2009,so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value: these
2009,sixty-three reputed species range on an average over . of the
2009,"provinces into which Mr. Watson has divided Great Britain. Now, in this"
2009,"same catalogue, fifty-three acknowledged varieties are recorded, and"
2009,"these range over . provinces; whereas, the species to which these"
2009,varieties belong range over . provinces. So that the acknowledged
2009,"varieties have very nearly the same restricted average range, as have"
2009,"the closely allied forms, marked for me by Mr. Watson as doubtful"
2009,"species, but which are almost universally ranked by British botanists as"
2009,good and true species.
2009,
2009,SUMMARY.
2009,
2009,"Finally, varieties cannot be distinguished from species--except, first,"
2009,"by the discovery of intermediate linking forms; and, secondly, by a"
2009,"certain indefinite amount of difference between them; for two forms,"
2009,"if differing very little, are generally ranked as varieties,"
2009,notwithstanding that they cannot be closely connected; but the amount
2009,of difference considered necessary to give to any two forms the rank of
2009,species cannot be defined. In genera having more than the average number
2009,"of species in any country, the species of these genera have more than"
2009,the average number of varieties. In large genera the species are apt to
2009,"be closely but unequally allied together, forming little clusters round"
2009,other species. Species very closely allied to other species apparently
2009,have restricted ranges. In all these respects the species of large
2009,genera present a strong analogy with varieties. And we can clearly
2009,"understand these analogies, if species once existed as varieties, and"
2009,"thus originated; whereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if"
2009,species are independent creations.
2009,
2009,We have also seen that it is the most flourishing or dominant species
2009,of the larger genera within each class which on an average yield the
2009,"greatest number of varieties, and varieties, as we shall hereafter see,"
2009,tend to become converted into new and distinct species. Thus the larger
2009,genera tend to become larger; and throughout nature the forms of life
2009,which are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by leaving
2009,"many modified and dominant descendants. But, by steps hereafter to be"
2009,"explained, the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera."
2009,"And thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into"
2009,groups subordinate to groups.

2009,CHAPTER III. STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.
2009,
2009, Its bearing on natural selection--The term used in a wide
2009, sense--Geometrical ratio of increase--Rapid increase of naturalised
2009, animals and plants--Nature of the checks to increase--Competition
2009, universal--Effects of climate--Protection from the number of
2009, individuals--Complex relations of all animals and plants throughout
2009, nature--Struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties
2009, of the same species: often severe between species of the same genus--The
2009, relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations.
2009,
2009,Before entering on the subject of this chapter I must make a few
2009,preliminary remarks to show how the struggle for existence bears on
2009,natural selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that
2009,among organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual
2009,variability: indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed.
2009,It is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called
2009,"species or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or"
2009,"three hundred doubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold,"
2009,if the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted. But the
2009,mere existence of individual variability and of some few well-marked
2009,"varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but"
2009,little in understanding how species arise in nature. How have all those
2009,"exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part,"
2009,"and to the conditions of life and of one organic being to another being,"
2009,been perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in
2009,the woodpecker and the mistletoe; and only a little less plainly in the
2009,humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers
2009,of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water;
2009,"in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we"
2009,see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic
2009,world.
2009,
2009,"Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called"
2009,"incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct"
2009,"species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far"
2009,more than do the varieties of the same species? How do those groups
2009,"of species, which constitute what are called distinct genera and which"
2009,"differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus,"
2009,"arise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next"
2009,"chapter, follow from the struggle for life. Owing to this struggle,"
2009,"variations, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if they"
2009,"be in any degree profitable to the individuals of a species, in their"
2009,infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to their
2009,"physical conditions of life, will tend to the preservation of such"
2009,"individuals, and will generally be inherited by the offspring. The"
2009,"offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of"
2009,"the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a"
2009,"small number can survive. I have called this principle, by which"
2009,"each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural"
2009,"selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection."
2009,"But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of"
2009,"the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient. We"
2009,"have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and"
2009,"can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of"
2009,"slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature. But"
2009,"Natural Selection, we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready"
2009,"for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as"
2009,the works of Nature are to those of Art.
2009,
2009,We will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence.
2009,"In my future work this subject will be treated, as it well deserves,"
2009,at greater length. The elder De Candolle and Lyell have largely and
2009,philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe
2009,"competition. In regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with"
2009,"more spirit and ability than W. Herbert, Dean of Manchester, evidently"
2009,the result of his great horticultural knowledge. Nothing is easier than
2009,"to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or"
2009,more difficult--at least I found it so--than constantly to bear this
2009,"conclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind,"
2009,"the whole economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity,"
2009,"abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite"
2009,"misunderstood. We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we"
2009,often see superabundance of food; we do not see or we forget that the
2009,"birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds,"
2009,and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these
2009,"songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and"
2009,"beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that, though food may be"
2009,"now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year."
2009,
2009,"THE TERM, STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE, USED IN A LARGE SENSE."
2009,
2009,"I should premise that I use this term in a large and metaphorical sense,"
2009,"including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is"
2009,"more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in"
2009,"leaving progeny. Two canine animals, in a time of dearth, may be truly"
2009,said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live. But a
2009,plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the
2009,"drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the"
2009,"moisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which"
2009,"only one of an average comes to maturity, may be more truly said to"
2009,struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already
2009,clothe the ground. The mistletoe is dependent on the apple and a few
2009,"other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle"
2009,"with these trees, for, if too many of these parasites grow on the same"
2009,"tree, it languishes and dies. But several seedling mistletoes, growing"
2009,"close together on the same branch, may more truly be said to struggle"
2009,"with each other. As the mistletoe is disseminated by birds, its"
2009,existence depends on them; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle
2009,"with other fruit-bearing plants, in tempting the birds to devour and"
2009,"thus disseminate its seeds. In these several senses, which pass into"
2009,"each other, I use for convenience sake the general term of Struggle for"
2009,Existence.
2009,
2009,GEOMETRICAL RATIO OF INCREASE.
2009,
2009,A struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which
2009,"all organic beings tend to increase. Every being, which during its"
2009,"natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction"
2009,"during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional"
2009,"year, otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers"
2009,would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support
2009,"the product. Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly"
2009,"survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either"
2009,"one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals"
2009,"of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life. It is the"
2009,doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and
2009,vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase
2009,"of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some"
2009,"species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all"
2009,"cannot do so, for the world would not hold them."
2009,
2009,There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally
2009,"increases at so high a rate, that, if not destroyed, the earth would"
2009,soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding
2009,"man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in less than"
2009,"a thousand years, there would literally not be standing room for his"
2009,progeny. Linnaeus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only
2009,two seeds--and there is no plant so unproductive as this--and their
2009,"seedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there"
2009,would be a million plants. The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder
2009,"of all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its"
2009,probable minimum rate of natural increase; it will be safest to assume
2009,"that it begins breeding when thirty years old, and goes on breeding"
2009,"till ninety years old, bringing forth six young in the interval, and"
2009,"surviving till one hundred years old; if this be so, after a period of"
2009,from  to  years there would be nearly nineteen million elephants
2009,alive descended from the first pair.
2009,
2009,But we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical
2009,"calculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly"
2009,"rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when"
2009,circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following
2009,seasons. Still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals
2009,of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world; if the
2009,statements of the rate of increase of slow-breeding cattle and horses
2009,"in South America, and latterly in Australia, had not been well"
2009,"authenticated, they would have been incredible. So it is with plants;"
2009,cases could be given of introduced plants which have become common
2009,throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years. Several of
2009,"the plants, such as the cardoon and a tall thistle, which are now the"
2009,"commonest over the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues"
2009,"of surface almost to the exclusion of every other plant, have been"
2009,"introduced from Europe; and there are plants which now range in India,"
2009,"as I hear from Dr. Falconer, from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya, which"
2009,"have been imported from America since its discovery. In such cases, and"
2009,"endless others could be given, no one supposes that the fertility of"
2009,the animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily increased in any
2009,sensible degree. The obvious explanation is that the conditions of life
2009,"have been highly favourable, and that there has consequently been less"
2009,destruction of the old and young and that nearly all the young have been
2009,"enabled to breed. Their geometrical ratio of increase, the result"
2009,"of which never fails to be surprising, simply explains their"
2009,extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion in their new homes.
2009,
2009,In a state of nature almost every full-grown plant annually produces
2009,"seed, and among animals there are very few which do not annually pair."
2009,Hence we may confidently assert that all plants and animals are tending
2009,to increase at a geometrical ratio--that all would rapidly stock every
2009,"station in which they could any how exist, and that this geometrical"
2009,tendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of
2009,"life. Our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, I think,"
2009,"to mislead us; we see no great destruction falling on them, and we do"
2009,"not keep in mind that thousands are annually slaughtered for food,"
2009,and that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be
2009,disposed of.
2009,
2009,The only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or
2009,"seeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is,"
2009,"that the slow breeders would require a few more years to people, under"
2009,"favourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large. The"
2009,"condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the"
2009,same country the condor may be the more numerous of the two. The Fulmar
2009,"petrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird"
2009,"in the world. One fly deposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the"
2009,"hippobosca, a single one. But this difference does not determine how"
2009,many individuals of the two species can be supported in a district. A
2009,large number of eggs is of some importance to those species which depend
2009,"on a fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them rapidly to increase"
2009,in number. But the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is
2009,to make up for much destruction at some period of life; and this period
2009,in the great majority of cases is an early one. If an animal can in any
2009,"way protect its own eggs or young, a small number may be produced, and"
2009,yet the average stock be fully kept up; but if many eggs or young are
2009,"destroyed, many must be produced or the species will become extinct. It"
2009,"would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree, which lived on an"
2009,"average for a thousand years, if a single seed were produced once in a"
2009,"thousand years, supposing that this seed were never destroyed and could"
2009,"be ensured to germinate in a fitting place; so that, in all cases, the"
2009,average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the
2009,number of its eggs or seeds.
2009,
2009,"In looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing"
2009,considerations always in mind--never to forget that every single organic
2009,being may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers;
2009,that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life; that heavy
2009,destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old during each
2009,"generation or at recurrent intervals. Lighten any check, mitigate the"
2009,"destruction ever so little, and the number of the species will almost"
2009,instantaneously increase to any amount.
2009,
2009,NATURE OF THE CHECKS TO INCREASE.
2009,
2009,The causes which check the natural tendency of each species to increase
2009,are most obscure. Look at the most vigorous species; by as much as it
2009,"swarms in numbers, by so much will it tend to increase still further. We"
2009,know not exactly what the checks are even in a single instance. Nor will
2009,"this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head,"
2009,"even in regard to mankind, although so incomparably better known than"
2009,any other animal. This subject of the checks to increase has been ably
2009,"treated by several authors, and I hope in a future work to discuss it at"
2009,"considerable length, more especially in regard to the feral animals of"
2009,"South America. Here I will make only a few remarks, just to recall to"
2009,the reader's mind some of the chief points. Eggs or very young animals
2009,"seem generally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the case. With"
2009,"plants there is a vast destruction of seeds, but from some observations"
2009,which I have made it appears that the seedlings suffer most from
2009,germinating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants.
2009,"Seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies; for"
2009,"instance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide, dug and"
2009,"cleared, and where there could be no choking from other plants, I marked"
2009,"all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up, and out of "
2009,"no less than  were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects. If turf"
2009,"which has long been mown, and the case would be the same with turf"
2009,"closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more vigorous plants"
2009,"gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown plants; thus out of"
2009,twenty species grown on a little plot of mown turf (three feet by four)
2009,"nine species perished, from the other species being allowed to grow up"
2009,freely.
2009,
2009,"The amount of food for each species, of course, gives the extreme limit"
2009,to which each can increase; but very frequently it is not the obtaining
2009,"food, but the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the"
2009,"average number of a species. Thus, there seems to be little doubt that"
2009,"the stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends"
2009,chiefly on the destruction of vermin. If not one head of game were shot
2009,"during the next twenty years in England, and, at the same time, if no"
2009,"vermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game"
2009,"than at present, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now"
2009,"annually shot. On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant,"
2009,none are destroyed by beasts of prey; for even the tiger in India most
2009,rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam.
2009,
2009,Climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of
2009,"a species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought seem to be"
2009,the most effective of all checks. I estimated (chiefly from the greatly
2009,reduced numbers of nests in the spring) that the winter of -
2009,destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is
2009,"a tremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent. is an"
2009,extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. The action of
2009,climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for
2009,"existence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it"
2009,"brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of"
2009,"the same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food."
2009,"Even when climate, for instance, extreme cold, acts directly, it will"
2009,"be the least vigorous individuals, or those which have got least food"
2009,"through the advancing winter, which will suffer the most. When we travel"
2009,"from south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably"
2009,"see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally"
2009,"disappearing; and the change of climate being conspicuous, we are"
2009,tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action. But this is
2009,"a false view; we forget that each species, even where it most abounds,"
2009,"is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life,"
2009,from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food; and if
2009,these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any
2009,"slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers; and as each"
2009,"area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species must"
2009,decrease. When we travel southward and see a species decreasing in
2009,"numbers, we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other"
2009,"species being favoured, as in this one being hurt. So it is when we"
2009,"travel northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of"
2009,"species of all kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases northward;"
2009,"hence in going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener"
2009,"meet with stunted forms, due to the DIRECTLY injurious action of"
2009,"climate, than we do in proceeding southward or in descending a mountain."
2009,"When we reach the Arctic regions, or snow-capped summits, or absolute"
2009,"deserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements."
2009,
2009,That climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species we
2009,clearly see in the prodigious number of plants which in our gardens can
2009,"perfectly well endure our climate, but which never become naturalised,"
2009,for they cannot compete with our native plants nor resist destruction by
2009,our native animals.
2009,
2009,"When a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases"
2009,"inordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics--at least, this"
2009,seems generally to occur with our game animals--often ensue; and here
2009,we have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life. But even
2009,"some of these so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms,"
2009,"which have from some cause, possibly in part through facility of"
2009,"diffusion among the crowded animals, been disproportionally favoured:"
2009,and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey.
2009,
2009,"On the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the"
2009,"same species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely"
2009,necessary for its preservation. Thus we can easily raise plenty of
2009,"corn and rape-seed, etc., in our fields, because the seeds are in great"
2009,excess compared with the number of birds which feed on them; nor can
2009,"the birds, though having a superabundance of food at this one season,"
2009,"increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their"
2009,numbers are checked during the winter; but any one who has tried knows
2009,how troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants
2009,in a garden; I have in this case lost every single seed. This view of
2009,"the necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation,"
2009,"explains, I believe, some singular facts in nature such as that of very"
2009,"rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant, in the few spots where"
2009,"they do exist; and that of some social plants being social, that is"
2009,"abounding in individuals, even on the extreme verge of their range. For"
2009,"in such cases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where"
2009,the conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist
2009,"together, and thus save the species from utter destruction. I should"
2009,"add that the good effects of intercrossing, and the ill effects of close"
2009,"interbreeding, no doubt come into play in many of these cases; but I"
2009,will not here enlarge on this subject.
2009,
2009,COMPLEX RELATIONS OF ALL ANIMALS AND PLANTS TO EACH OTHER IN THE
2009,STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.
2009,
2009,Many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the
2009,"checks and relations between organic beings, which have to struggle"
2009,"together in the same country. I will give only a single instance, which,"
2009,"though a simple one, interested me. In Staffordshire, on the estate of"
2009,"a relation, where I had ample means of investigation, there was a large"
2009,"and extremely barren heath, which had never been touched by the hand"
2009,of man; but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been
2009,enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch fir. The
2009,change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was
2009,"most remarkable, more than is generally seen in passing from one quite"
2009,different soil to another: not only the proportional numbers of the
2009,"heath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants (not"
2009,"counting grasses and carices) flourished in the plantations, which could"
2009,not be found on the heath. The effect on the insects must have been
2009,"still greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common in the"
2009,"plantations, which were not to be seen on the heath; and the heath was"
2009,frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds. Here we see how
2009,"potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree, nothing"
2009,"whatever else having been done, with the exception of the land having"
2009,"been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. But how important an"
2009,"element enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey. Here"
2009,"there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on"
2009,the distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been
2009,"enclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so"
2009,close together that all cannot live. When I ascertained that these young
2009,trees had not been sown or planted I was so much surprised at their
2009,"numbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could examine"
2009,"hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally I could not"
2009,"see a single Scotch fir, except the old planted clumps. But on looking"
2009,"closely between the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings"
2009,"and little trees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle."
2009,"In one square yard, at a point some hundred yards distant from one of"
2009,"the old clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees; and one of them, with"
2009,"twenty-six rings of growth, had, during many years tried to raise its"
2009,"head above the stems of the heath, and had failed. No wonder that, as"
2009,"soon as the land was enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously"
2009,growing young firs. Yet the heath was so extremely barren and so
2009,extensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so
2009,closely and effectually searched it for food.
2009,
2009,Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch
2009,fir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence
2009,of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this;
2009,"for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though"
2009,they swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and Azara and
2009,Rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay
2009,"of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals"
2009,"when first born. The increase of these flies, numerous as they are,"
2009,"must be habitually checked by some means, probably by other parasitic"
2009,"insects. Hence, if certain insectivorous birds were to decrease in"
2009,"Paraguay, the parasitic insects would probably increase; and this would"
2009,lessen the number of the navel-frequenting flies--then cattle and horses
2009,"would become feral, and this would certainly greatly alter (as indeed"
2009,I have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation: this again
2009,"would largely affect the insects; and this, as we have just seen"
2009,"in Staffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in"
2009,ever-increasing circles of complexity. Not that under nature the
2009,relations will ever be as simple as this. Battle within battle must be
2009,continually recurring with varying success; and yet in the long-run the
2009,forces are so nicely balanced that the face of nature remains for long
2009,"periods of time uniform, though assuredly the merest trifle would give"
2009,"the victory to one organic being over another. Nevertheless, so profound"
2009,"is our ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we marvel when we"
2009,hear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we do not see the
2009,"cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent laws on the"
2009,duration of the forms of life!
2009,
2009,"I am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals,"
2009,"remote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex"
2009,relations. I shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic
2009,"Lobelia fulgens is never visited in my garden by insects, and"
2009,"consequently, from its peculiar structure, never sets a seed. Nearly"
2009,all our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of insects
2009,to remove their pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. I find
2009,from experiments that humble-bees are almost indispensable to the
2009,"fertilisation of the heartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do"
2009,not visit this flower. I have also found that the visits of bees are
2009,necessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover; for instance
2009,"twenty heads of Dutch clover (Trifolium repens) yielded , seeds, but"
2009,"twenty other heads, protected from bees, produced not one. Again, "
2009,"heads of red clover (T. pratense) produced , seeds, but the same"
2009,number of protected heads produced not a single seed. Humble bees alone
2009,"visit red clover, as other bees cannot reach the nectar. It has been"
2009,suggested that moths may fertilise the clovers; but I doubt whether they
2009,"could do so in the case of the red clover, from their weight not being"
2009,sufficient to depress the wing petals. Hence we may infer as highly
2009,"probable that, if the whole genus of humble-bees became extinct or very"
2009,"rare in England, the heartsease and red clover would become very rare,"
2009,or wholly disappear. The number of humble-bees in any district depends
2009,"in a great measure upon the number of field-mice, which destroy their"
2009,"combs and nests; and Colonel Newman, who has long attended to the habits"
2009,"of humble-bees, believes that ""more than two-thirds of them are"
2009,"thus destroyed all over England."" Now the number of mice is largely"
2009,"dependent, as every one knows, on the number of cats; and Colonel"
2009,"Newman says, ""Near villages and small towns I have found the nests"
2009,"of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the"
2009,"number of cats that destroy the mice."" Hence it is quite credible that"
2009,the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might
2009,"determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the"
2009,frequency of certain flowers in that district!
2009,
2009,"In the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different"
2009,"periods of life, and during different seasons or years, probably come"
2009,"into play; some one check or some few being generally the most potent,"
2009,"but all will concur in determining the average number, or even"
2009,the existence of the species. In some cases it can be shown that
2009,widely-different checks act on the same species in different districts.
2009,"When we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank, we"
2009,are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we
2009,call chance. But how false a view is this! Every one has heard that when
2009,"an American forest is cut down, a very different vegetation springs"
2009,up; but it has been observed that ancient Indian ruins in the Southern
2009,"United States, which must formerly have been cleared of trees, now"
2009,display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the
2009,surrounding virgin forests. What a struggle must have gone on during
2009,"long centuries between the several kinds of trees, each annually"
2009,scattering its seeds by the thousand; what war between insect and
2009,"insect--between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts"
2009,"of prey--all striving to increase, all feeding on each other, or on the"
2009,"trees, their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first"
2009,clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees. Throw up
2009,"a handful of feathers, and all fall to the ground according to definite"
2009,laws; but how simple is the problem where each shall fall compared to
2009,that of the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals
2009,"which have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional"
2009,numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins!
2009,
2009,"The dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its"
2009,"prey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature. This"
2009,is likewise sometimes the case with those which may strictly be said to
2009,"struggle with each other for existence, as in the case of locusts and"
2009,grass-feeding quadrupeds. But the struggle will almost invariably
2009,"be most severe between the individuals of the same species, for they"
2009,"frequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed"
2009,"to the same dangers. In the case of varieties of the same species, the"
2009,"struggle will generally be almost equally severe, and we sometimes see"
2009,"the contest soon decided: for instance, if several varieties of wheat be"
2009,"sown together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties which"
2009,"best suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile, will"
2009,"beat the others and so yield more seed, and will consequently in a few"
2009,years supplant the other varieties. To keep up a mixed stock of even
2009,"such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweet-peas,"
2009,"they must be each year harvested separately, and the seed then mixed"
2009,"in due proportion, otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in"
2009,number and disappear. So again with the varieties of sheep: it has
2009,been asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out other
2009,"mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept together. The same"
2009,result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the
2009,medicinal leech. It may even be doubted whether the varieties of any
2009,"of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength,"
2009,"habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a mixed"
2009,stock (crossing being prevented) could be kept up for half-a-dozen
2009,"generations, if they were allowed to struggle together, in the same"
2009,"manner as beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or young were not"
2009,annually preserved in due proportion.
2009,
2009,STRUGGLE FOR LIFE MOST SEVERE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND VARIETIES OF THE
2009,SAME SPECIES.
2009,
2009,"As the species of the same genus usually have, though by no means"
2009,"invariably, much similarity in habits and constitution, and always in"
2009,"structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between them, if"
2009,"they come into competition with each other, than between the species of"
2009,distinct genera. We see this in the recent extension over parts of the
2009,United States of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of
2009,another species. The recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of
2009,Scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush. How frequently we
2009,hear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under
2009,the most different climates! In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach
2009,has everywhere driven before it its great congener. In Australia the
2009,"imported hive-bee is rapidly exterminating the small, stingless native"
2009,bee. One species of charlock has been known to supplant another species;
2009,and so in other cases. We can dimly see why the competition should be
2009,"most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in"
2009,the economy of nature; but probably in no one case could we precisely
2009,say why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle
2009,of life.
2009,
2009,A corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing
2009,"remarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being is related,"
2009,"in the most essential yet often hidden manner, to that of all other"
2009,"organic beings, with which it comes into competition for food or"
2009,"residence, or from which it has to escape, or on which it preys. This"
2009,is obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger; and in
2009,that of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair on
2009,"the tiger's body. But in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion,"
2009,"and in the flattened and fringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation"
2009,seems at first confined to the elements of air and water. Yet the
2009,advantage of the plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation
2009,to the land being already thickly clothed with other plants; so that the
2009,seeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground. In the
2009,"water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well adapted for diving,"
2009,"allows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to hunt for its own"
2009,"prey, and to escape serving as prey to other animals."
2009,
2009,The store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at
2009,first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants. But from the
2009,"strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds, as peas and"
2009,"beans, when sown in the midst of long grass, it may be suspected that"
2009,the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of
2009,"the seedlings, whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously"
2009,all around.
2009,
2009,Look at a plant in the midst of its range! Why does it not double or
2009,quadruple its numbers? We know that it can perfectly well withstand a
2009,"little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges"
2009,"into slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. In this case"
2009,we can clearly see that if we wish in imagination to give the plant the
2009,"power of increasing in numbers, we should have to give it some advantage"
2009,"over its competitors, or over the animals which prey on it. On the"
2009,"confines of its geographical range, a change of constitution with"
2009,respect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant; but we
2009,"have reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far,"
2009,that they are destroyed exclusively by the rigour of the climate. Not
2009,"until we reach the extreme confines of life, in the Arctic regions or on"
2009,"the borders of an utter desert, will competition cease. The land may be"
2009,"extremely cold or dry, yet there will be competition between some few"
2009,"species, or between the individuals of the same species, for the warmest"
2009,or dampest spots.
2009,
2009,"Hence we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new country,"
2009,"among new competitors, the conditions of its life will generally be"
2009,"changed in an essential manner, although the climate may be exactly the"
2009,same as in its former home. If its average numbers are to increase in
2009,"its new home, we should have to modify it in a different way to what we"
2009,should have had to do in its native country; for we should have to give
2009,it some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies.
2009,
2009,It is good thus to try in imagination to give any one species an
2009,advantage over another. Probably in no single instance should we know
2009,what to do. This ought to convince us of our ignorance on the mutual
2009,"relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it is"
2009,difficult to acquire. All that we can do is to keep steadily in mind
2009,that each organic being is striving to increase in a geometrical ratio;
2009,"that each, at some period of its life, during some season of the year,"
2009,"during each generation, or at intervals, has to struggle for life and"
2009,to suffer great destruction. When we reflect on this struggle we may
2009,console ourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not
2009,"incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and"
2009,"that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply."

2009,
2009,
2009,"How will the struggle for existence, briefly discussed in the last"
2009,"chapter, act in regard to variation? Can the principle of selection,"
2009,"which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply under nature?"
2009,I think we shall see that it can act most efficiently. Let the endless
2009,number of slight variations and individual differences occurring in our
2009,"domestic productions, and, in a lesser degree, in those under nature, be"
2009,borne in mind; as well as the strength of the hereditary tendency. Under
2009,"domestication, it may truly be said that the whole organisation becomes"
2009,"in some degree plastic. But the variability, which we almost universally"
2009,"meet with in our domestic productions is not directly produced, as"
2009,"Hooker and Asa Gray have well remarked, by man; he can neither originate"
2009,varieties nor prevent their occurrence; he can only preserve and
2009,accumulate such as do occur. Unintentionally he exposes organic beings
2009,"to new and changing conditions of life, and variability ensues; but"
2009,similar changes of conditions might and do occur under nature. Let it
2009,also be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are
2009,the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their
2009,physical conditions of life; and consequently what infinitely varied
2009,diversities of structure might be of use to each being under changing
2009,"conditions of life. Can it then be thought improbable, seeing that"
2009,"variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other"
2009,variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex
2009,"battle of life, should occur in the course of many successive"
2009,"generations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more"
2009,individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having
2009,"any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance"
2009,"of surviving and procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel"
2009,sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly
2009,destroyed. This preservation of favourable individual differences and
2009,"variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have"
2009,"called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest. Variations"
2009,"neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection,"
2009,"and would be left either a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in"
2009,"certain polymorphic species, or would ultimately become fixed, owing to"
2009,the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions.
2009,
2009,Several writers have misapprehended or objected to the term Natural
2009,Selection. Some have even imagined that natural selection induces
2009,"variability, whereas it implies only the preservation of such variations"
2009,as arise and are beneficial to the being under its conditions of life.
2009,No one objects to agriculturists speaking of the potent effects of man's
2009,"selection; and in this case the individual differences given by nature,"
2009,"which man for some object selects, must of necessity first occur. Others"
2009,have objected that the term selection implies conscious choice in the
2009,"animals which become modified; and it has even been urged that, as"
2009,"plants have no volition, natural selection is not applicable to them!"
2009,"In the literal sense of the word, no doubt, natural selection is a"
2009,false term; but who ever objected to chemists speaking of the elective
2009,affinities of the various elements?--and yet an acid cannot strictly be
2009,said to elect the base with which it in preference combines. It has been
2009,said that I speak of natural selection as an active power or Deity; but
2009,who objects to an author speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling
2009,the movements of the planets? Every one knows what is meant and is
2009,implied by such metaphorical expressions; and they are almost necessary
2009,for brevity. So again it is difficult to avoid personifying the word
2009,"Nature; but I mean by nature, only the aggregate action and product of"
2009,"many natural laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained"
2009,by us. With a little familiarity such superficial objections will be
2009,forgotten.
2009,
2009,We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by
2009,"taking the case of a country undergoing some slight physical change, for"
2009,"instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants will"
2009,"almost immediately undergo a change, and some species will probably"
2009,"become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate"
2009,and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are
2009,"bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of the"
2009,"inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would"
2009,"seriously affect the others. If the country were open on its borders,"
2009,"new forms would certainly immigrate, and this would likewise seriously"
2009,disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be
2009,remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or
2009,"mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a"
2009,"country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted"
2009,"forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy"
2009,of nature which would assuredly be better filled up if some of the
2009,"original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area"
2009,"been open to immigration, these same places would have been seized on"
2009,"by intruders. In such cases, slight modifications, which in any way"
2009,"favoured the individuals of any species, by better adapting them to"
2009,"their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved; and natural"
2009,selection would have free scope for the work of improvement.
2009,
2009,"We have good reason to believe, as shown in the first chapter,"
2009,that changes in the conditions of life give a tendency to increased
2009,"variability; and in the foregoing cases the conditions the changed, and"
2009,"this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by affording"
2009,a better chance of the occurrence of profitable variations. Unless such
2009,"occur, natural selection can do nothing. Under the term of ""variations,"""
2009,it must never be forgotten that mere individual differences are
2009,included. As man can produce a great result with his domestic animals
2009,"and plants by adding up in any given direction individual differences,"
2009,"so could natural selection, but far more easily from having incomparably"
2009,"longer time for action. Nor do I believe that any great physical change,"
2009,"as of climate, or any unusual degree of isolation, to check immigration,"
2009,is necessary in order that new and unoccupied places should be left
2009,for natural selection to fill up by improving some of the varying
2009,inhabitants. For as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling
2009,"together with nicely balanced forces, extremely slight modifications in"
2009,the structure or habits of one species would often give it an advantage
2009,over others; and still further modifications of the same kind would
2009,"often still further increase the advantage, as long as the species"
2009,continued under the same conditions of life and profited by similar
2009,means of subsistence and defence. No country can be named in which all
2009,the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to
2009,"the physical conditions under which they live, that none of them could"
2009,"be still better adapted or improved; for in all countries, the natives"
2009,have been so far conquered by naturalised productions that they have
2009,allowed some foreigners to take firm possession of the land. And as
2009,"foreigners have thus in every country beaten some of the natives, we"
2009,may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified with
2009,"advantage, so as to have better resisted the intruders."
2009,
2009,"As man can produce, and certainly has produced, a great result by his"
2009,"methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not natural"
2009,selection effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters:
2009,"Nature, if I may be allowed to personify the natural preservation or"
2009,"survival of the fittest, cares nothing for appearances, except in so far"
2009,"as they are useful to any being. She can act on every internal organ,"
2009,"on every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of"
2009,life. Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the
2009,being which she tends. Every selected character is fully exercised by
2009,"her, as is implied by the fact of their selection. Man keeps the natives"
2009,of many climates in the same country. He seldom exercises each selected
2009,character in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a
2009,short-beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed
2009,or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep
2009,with long and short wool to the same climate; does not allow the most
2009,vigorous males to struggle for the females; he does not rigidly destroy
2009,"all inferior animals, but protects during each varying season, as far as"
2009,"lies in his power, all his productions. He often begins his selection"
2009,"by some half-monstrous form, or at least by some modification prominent"
2009,"enough to catch the eye or to be plainly useful to him. Under nature,"
2009,the slightest differences of structure or constitution may well turn the
2009,"nicely-balanced scale in the struggle for life, and so be preserved."
2009,"How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! How short his time,"
2009,"and consequently how poor will be his results, compared with those"
2009,"accumulated by Nature during whole geological periods! Can we wonder,"
2009,"then, that Nature's productions should be far ""truer"" in character than"
2009,man's productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the
2009,"most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of"
2009,far higher workmanship?
2009,
2009,It may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and hourly
2009,"scrutinising, throughout the world, the slightest variations; rejecting"
2009,"those that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are good; silently"
2009,"and insensibly working, WHENEVER AND WHEREVER OPPORTUNITY OFFERS, at"
2009,the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and
2009,inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in
2009,"progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages, and"
2009,then so imperfect is our view into long-past geological ages that we see
2009,only that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly
2009,were.
2009,
2009,In order that any great amount of modification should be effected in a
2009,"species, a variety, when once formed must again, perhaps after a long"
2009,"interval of time, vary or present individual differences of the same"
2009,"favourable nature as before; and these must again be preserved, and so"
2009,"onward, step by step. Seeing that individual differences of the"
2009,"same kind perpetually recur, this can hardly be considered as an"
2009,"unwarrantable assumption. But whether it is true, we can judge only"
2009,by seeing how far the hypothesis accords with and explains the general
2009,"phenomena of nature. On the other hand, the ordinary belief that the"
2009,"amount of possible variation is a strictly limited quantity, is likewise"
2009,a simple assumption.
2009,
2009,Although natural selection can act only through and for the good of each
2009,"being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider as of"
2009,"very trifling importance, may thus be acted on. When we see leaf-eating"
2009,"insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white"
2009,"in winter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, we must believe that"
2009,these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them
2009,"from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives,"
2009,would increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely
2009,"from birds of prey; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey,--so"
2009,much so that on parts of the continent persons are warned not to keep
2009,"white pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction. Hence natural"
2009,selection might be effective in giving the proper colour to each kind
2009,"of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and"
2009,constant. Nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an
2009,animal of any particular colour would produce little effect; we should
2009,remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy a lamb
2009,"with the faintest trace of black. We have seen how the colour of hogs,"
2009,"which feed on the ""paint-root"" in Virginia, determines whether they"
2009,"shall live or die. In plants, the down on the fruit and the colour of"
2009,the flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling
2009,"importance; yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing,"
2009,that in the United States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a
2009,"beetle, a Curculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far"
2009,more from a certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease
2009,attacks yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured
2009,"flesh. If, with all the aids of art, these slight differences make a"
2009,"great difference in cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a"
2009,"state of nature, where the trees would have to struggle with other trees"
2009,"and with a host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle"
2009,"which variety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or a purple-fleshed"
2009,"fruit, should succeed."
2009,
2009,"In looking at many small points of difference between species, which,"
2009,"as far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem quite unimportant, we"
2009,"must not forget that climate, food, etc., have no doubt produced some"
2009,"direct effect. It is also necessary to bear in mind that, owing to"
2009,"the law of correlation, when one part varies and the variations are"
2009,"accumulated through natural selection, other modifications, often of the"
2009,"most unexpected nature, will ensue."
2009,
2009,"As we see that those variations which, under domestication, appear at"
2009,"any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the"
2009,"same period; for instance, in the shape, size and flavour of the seeds"
2009,of the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants; in the
2009,caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm; in the
2009,"eggs of poultry, and in the colour of the down of their chickens; in the"
2009,horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult; so in a state of nature
2009,natural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at
2009,"any age, by the accumulation of variations profitable at that age, and"
2009,by their inheritance at a corresponding age. If it profit a plant to
2009,"have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind, I can see"
2009,"no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection,"
2009,than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by selection the
2009,down in the pods on his cotton-trees. Natural selection may modify
2009,"and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies, wholly"
2009,different from those which concern the mature insect; and these
2009,"modifications may affect, through correlation, the structure of the"
2009,"adult. So, conversely, modifications in the adult may affect the"
2009,structure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection will ensure
2009,"that they shall not be injurious: for if they were so, the species would"
2009,become extinct.
2009,
2009,Natural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation to
2009,the parent and of the parent in relation to the young. In social animals
2009,it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the
2009,whole community; if the community profits by the selected change. What
2009,"natural selection cannot do, is to modify the structure of one species,"
2009,"without giving it any advantage, for the good of another species;"
2009,and though statements to this effect may be found in works of natural
2009,"history, I cannot find one case which will bear investigation. A"
2009,"structure used only once in an animal's life, if of high importance to"
2009,"it, might be modified to any extent by natural selection; for instance,"
2009,"the great jaws possessed by certain insects, used exclusively for"
2009,"opening the cocoon--or the hard tip to the beak of unhatched birds,"
2009,"used for breaking the eggs. It has been asserted, that of the best"
2009,short-beaked tumbler-pigeons a greater number perish in the egg than are
2009,able to get out of it; so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching.
2009,"Now, if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short"
2009,"for the bird's own advantage, the process of modification would be very"
2009,"slow, and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection"
2009,"of all the young birds within the egg, which had the most powerful and"
2009,"hardest beaks, for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or, more"
2009,"delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected, the thickness"
2009,of the shell being known to vary like every other structure.
2009,
2009,It may be well here to remark that with all beings there must be much
2009,"fortuitous destruction, which can have little or no influence on the"
2009,"course of natural selection. For instance, a vast number of eggs or"
2009,"seeds are annually devoured, and these could be modified through natural"
2009,selection only if they varied in some manner which protected them from
2009,"their enemies. Yet many of these eggs or seeds would perhaps, if not"
2009,"destroyed, have yielded individuals better adapted to their conditions"
2009,of life than any of those which happened to survive. So again a vast
2009,"number of mature animals and plants, whether or not they be the best"
2009,"adapted to their conditions, must be annually destroyed by accidental"
2009,"causes, which would not be in the least degree mitigated by certain"
2009,changes of structure or constitution which would in other ways be
2009,beneficial to the species. But let the destruction of the adults be ever
2009,"so heavy, if the number which can exist in any district be not wholly"
2009,kept down by such causes--or again let the destruction of eggs or
2009,seeds be so great that only a hundredth or a thousandth part are
2009,"developed--yet of those which do survive, the best adapted individuals,"
2009,"supposing that there is any variability in a favourable direction,"
2009,will tend to propagate their kind in larger numbers than the less
2009,well adapted. If the numbers be wholly kept down by the causes just
2009,"indicated, as will often have been the case, natural selection will"
2009,be powerless in certain beneficial directions; but this is no valid
2009,objection to its efficiency at other times and in other ways; for we
2009,are far from having any reason to suppose that many species ever undergo
2009,modification and improvement at the same time in the same area.
2009,
2009,SEXUAL SELECTION.
2009,
2009,Inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex
2009,"and become hereditarily attached to that sex, so no doubt it will be"
2009,under nature. Thus it is rendered possible for the two sexes to be
2009,modified through natural selection in relation to different habits
2009,"of life, as is sometimes the case; or for one sex to be modified in"
2009,"relation to the other sex, as commonly occurs. This leads me to say a"
2009,few words on what I have called sexual selection. This form of selection
2009,"depends, not on a struggle for existence in relation to other organic"
2009,"beings or to external conditions, but on a struggle between the"
2009,"individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the"
2009,"other sex. The result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but"
2009,"few or no offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than"
2009,"natural selection. Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are"
2009,"best fitted for their places in nature, will leave most progeny. But in"
2009,"many cases victory depends not so much on general vigour, but on having"
2009,"special weapons, confined to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless"
2009,cock would have a poor chance of leaving numerous offspring. Sexual
2009,"selection, by always allowing the victor to breed, might surely give"
2009,"indomitable courage, length of spur, and strength to the wing to"
2009,"strike in the spurred leg, in nearly the same manner as does the brutal"
2009,cockfighter by the careful selection of his best cocks. How low in the
2009,scale of nature the law of battle descends I know not; male alligators
2009,"have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like"
2009,"Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females; male salmons"
2009,have been observed fighting all day long; male stag-beetles sometimes
2009,bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males; the males of certain
2009,hymenopterous insects have been frequently seen by that inimitable
2009,"observer M. Fabre, fighting for a particular female who sits by, an"
2009,"apparently unconcerned beholder of the struggle, and then retires"
2009,"with the conqueror. The war is, perhaps, severest between the males"
2009,"of polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest provided with special"
2009,weapons. The males of carnivorous animals are already well armed; though
2009,"to them and to others, special means of defence may be given through"
2009,"means of sexual selection, as the mane of the lion, and the hooked jaw"
2009,to the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory as
2009,the sword or spear.
2009,
2009,"Among birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character. All"
2009,"those who have attended to the subject, believe that there is the"
2009,"severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract, by"
2009,"singing, the females. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of paradise,"
2009,"and some others, congregate, and successive males display with the most"
2009,"elaborate care, and show off in the best manner, their gorgeous plumage;"
2009,"they likewise perform strange antics before the females, which, standing"
2009,"by as spectators, at last choose the most attractive partner. Those who"
2009,have closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they
2009,often take individual preferences and dislikes: thus Sir R. Heron has
2009,described how a pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen
2009,birds. I cannot here enter on the necessary details; but if man can in a
2009,"short time give beauty and an elegant carriage to his bantams, according"
2009,"to his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt that female"
2009,"birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious"
2009,"or beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might produce"
2009,"a marked effect. Some well-known laws, with respect to the plumage of"
2009,"male and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of the young, can"
2009,partly be explained through the action of sexual selection on variations
2009,"occurring at different ages, and transmitted to the males alone or to"
2009,both sexes at corresponding ages; but I have not space here to enter on
2009,this subject.
2009,
2009,"Thus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any animal"
2009,"have the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour,"
2009,"or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual"
2009,"selection: that is, by individual males having had, in successive"
2009,"generations, some slight advantage over other males, in their weapons,"
2009,"means of defence, or charms; which they have transmitted to their"
2009,"male offspring alone. Yet, I would not wish to attribute all sexual"
2009,differences to this agency: for we see in our domestic animals
2009,"peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex, which"
2009,apparently have not been augmented through selection by man. The tuft of
2009,"hair on the breast of the wild turkey-cock cannot be of any use, and it"
2009,is doubtful whether it can be ornamental in the eyes of the female bird;
2009,"indeed, had the tuft appeared under domestication it would have been"
2009,called a monstrosity.
2009,
2009,"ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE ACTION OF NATURAL SELECTION, OR THE SURVIVAL OF THE"
2009,FITTEST.
2009,
2009,"In order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural selection acts, I"
2009,must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations. Let us
2009,"take the case of a wolf, which preys on various animals, securing some"
2009,"by craft, some by strength, and some by fleetness; and let us suppose"
2009,"that the fleetest prey, a deer for instance, had from any change in"
2009,"the country increased in numbers, or that other prey had decreased"
2009,"in numbers, during that season of the year when the wolf was hardest"
2009,pressed for food. Under such circumstances the swiftest and slimmest
2009,"wolves have the best chance of surviving, and so be preserved or"
2009,"selected, provided always that they retained strength to master their"
2009,"prey at this or some other period of the year, when they were compelled"
2009,to prey on other animals. I can see no more reason to doubt that
2009,"this would be the result, than that man should be able to improve the"
2009,"fleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by"
2009,that kind of unconscious selection which follows from each man trying to
2009,keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed. I may
2009,"add that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two varieties of the wolf"
2009,"inhabiting the Catskill Mountains, in the United States, one with a"
2009,"light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and the other more bulky,"
2009,"with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks the shepherd's flocks."
2009,
2009,Even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on
2009,"which our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to"
2009,pursue certain kinds of prey. Nor can this be thought very improbable;
2009,for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our
2009,"domestic animals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another"
2009,"mice; one cat, according to Mr. St. John, bringing home winged game,"
2009,"another hares or rabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and"
2009,almost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes. The tendency to catch rats
2009,"rather than mice is known to be inherited. Now, if any slight innate"
2009,"change of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf, it would"
2009,have the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring. Some of its
2009,"young would probably inherit the same habits or structure, and by the"
2009,"repetition of this process, a new variety might be formed which would"
2009,"either supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf. Or, again,"
2009,"the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those frequenting the"
2009,"lowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey; and from the"
2009,"continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites,"
2009,two varieties might slowly be formed. These varieties would cross and
2009,blend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon
2009,"have to return. I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two"
2009,varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the United
2009,"States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and"
2009,"the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks"
2009,the shepherd's flocks.
2009,
2009,"It should be observed that in the above illustration, I speak of the"
2009,"slimmest individual wolves, and not of any single strongly marked"
2009,variation having been preserved. In former editions of this work I
2009,sometimes spoke as if this latter alternative had frequently occurred.
2009,"I saw the great importance of individual differences, and this led me"
2009,"fully to discuss the results of unconscious selection by man,"
2009,which depends on the preservation of all the more or less valuable
2009,"individuals, and on the destruction of the worst. I saw, also, that"
2009,the preservation in a state of nature of any occasional deviation of
2009,"structure, such as a monstrosity, would be a rare event; and that, if at"
2009,"first preserved, it would generally be lost by subsequent intercrossing"
2009,"with ordinary individuals. Nevertheless, until reading an able and"
2009,"valuable article in the ""North British Review"" (), I did not"
2009,"appreciate how rarely single variations, whether slight or strongly"
2009,"marked, could be perpetuated. The author takes the case of a pair of"
2009,"animals, producing during their lifetime two hundred offspring, of"
2009,"which, from various causes of destruction, only two on an average"
2009,survive to pro-create their kind. This is rather an extreme estimate
2009,"for most of the higher animals, but by no means so for many of the lower"
2009,"organisms. He then shows that if a single individual were born, which"
2009,"varied in some manner, giving it twice as good a chance of life as that"
2009,"of the other individuals, yet the chances would be strongly against its"
2009,"survival. Supposing it to survive and to breed, and that half its young"
2009,"inherited the favourable variation; still, as the Reviewer goes onto"
2009,"show, the young would have only a slightly better chance of surviving"
2009,and breeding; and this chance would go on decreasing in the succeeding
2009,"generations. The justice of these remarks cannot, I think, be disputed."
2009,"If, for instance, a bird of some kind could procure its food more easily"
2009,"by having its beak curved, and if one were born with its beak strongly"
2009,"curved, and which consequently flourished, nevertheless there would be"
2009,a very poor chance of this one individual perpetuating its kind to the
2009,"exclusion of the common form; but there can hardly be a doubt, judging"
2009,"by what we see taking place under domestication, that this result would"
2009,follow from the preservation during many generations of a large number
2009,"of individuals with more or less strongly curved beaks, and from the"
2009,destruction of a still larger number with the straightest beaks.
2009,
2009,"It should not, however, be overlooked that certain rather strongly"
2009,"marked variations, which no one would rank as mere individual"
2009,"differences, frequently recur owing to a similar organisation being"
2009,similarly acted on--of which fact numerous instances could be given with
2009,"our domestic productions. In such cases, if the varying individual did"
2009,"not actually transmit to its offspring its newly-acquired character, it"
2009,"would undoubtedly transmit to them, as long as the existing conditions"
2009,"remained the same, a still stronger tendency to vary in the same manner."
2009,There can also be little doubt that the tendency to vary in the same
2009,manner has often been so strong that all the individuals of the same
2009,species have been similarly modified without the aid of any form of
2009,"selection. Or only a third, fifth, or tenth part of the individuals may"
2009,"have been thus affected, of which fact several instances could be given."
2009,Thus Graba estimates that about one-fifth of the guillemots in the Faroe
2009,"Islands consist of a variety so well marked, that it was formerly ranked"
2009,as a distinct species under the name of Uria lacrymans. In cases of this
2009,"kind, if the variation were of a beneficial nature, the original form"
2009,"would soon be supplanted by the modified form, through the survival of"
2009,the fittest.
2009,
2009,"To the effects of intercrossing in eliminating variations of all kinds,"
2009,I shall have to recur; but it may be here remarked that most animals and
2009,"plants keep to their proper homes, and do not needlessly wander about;"
2009,"we see this even with migratory birds, which almost always return to the"
2009,same spot. Consequently each newly-formed variety would generally be at
2009,"first local, as seems to be the common rule with varieties in a state"
2009,of nature; so that similarly modified individuals would soon exist in a
2009,"small body together, and would often breed together. If the new variety"
2009,"were successful in its battle for life, it would slowly spread from"
2009,"a central district, competing with and conquering the unchanged"
2009,individuals on the margins of an ever-increasing circle.
2009,
2009,It may be worth while to give another and more complex illustration of
2009,"the action of natural selection. Certain plants excrete sweet juice,"
2009,apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from the sap:
2009,"this is effected, for instance, by glands at the base of the stipules in"
2009,"some Leguminosae, and at the backs of the leaves of the common laurel."
2009,"This juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects; but"
2009,"their visits do not in any way benefit the plant. Now, let us suppose"
2009,that the juice or nectar was excreted from the inside of the flowers of
2009,a certain number of plants of any species. Insects in seeking the nectar
2009,"would get dusted with pollen, and would often transport it from one"
2009,flower to another. The flowers of two distinct individuals of the same
2009,"species would thus get crossed; and the act of crossing, as can be fully"
2009,"proved, gives rise to vigorous seedlings, which consequently would have"
2009,the best chance of flourishing and surviving. The plants which produced
2009,"flowers with the largest glands or nectaries, excreting most nectar,"
2009,"would oftenest be visited by insects, and would oftenest be crossed; and"
2009,so in the long-run would gain the upper hand and form a local variety.
2009,"The flowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils placed, in"
2009,relation to the size and habits of the particular insect which visited
2009,"them, so as to favour in any degree the transportal of the pollen, would"
2009,likewise be favoured. We might have taken the case of insects visiting
2009,flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar; and as
2009,"pollen is formed for the sole purpose of fertilisation, its destruction"
2009,appears to be a simple loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen
2009,"were carried, at first occasionally and then habitually, by the"
2009,"pollen-devouring insects from flower to flower, and a cross thus"
2009,"effected, although nine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed it"
2009,might still be a great gain to the plant to be thus robbed; and the
2009,"individuals which produced more and more pollen, and had larger anthers,"
2009,would be selected.
2009,
2009,"When our plant, by the above process long continued, had been rendered"
2009,"highly attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their part,"
2009,regularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and that they do this
2009,effectually I could easily show by many striking facts. I will give only
2009,"one, as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of"
2009,"plants. Some holly-trees bear only male flowers, which have four stamens"
2009,"producing a rather small quantity of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil;"
2009,other holly-trees bear only female flowers; these have a full-sized
2009,"pistil, and four stamens with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain"
2009,of pollen can be detected. Having found a female tree exactly sixty
2009,"yards from a male tree, I put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from"
2009,"different branches, under the microscope, and on all, without exception,"
2009,"there were a few pollen-grains, and on some a profusion. As the wind had"
2009,"set for several days from the female to the male tree, the pollen could"
2009,not thus have been carried. The weather had been cold and boisterous and
2009,"therefore not favourable to bees, nevertheless every female flower which"
2009,"I examined had been effectually fertilised by the bees, which had flown"
2009,from tree to tree in search of nectar. But to return to our imaginary
2009,case; as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to
2009,"insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower, another"
2009,process might commence. No naturalist doubts the advantage of what has
2009,"been called the ""physiological division of labour;"" hence we may believe"
2009,that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one
2009,"flower or on one whole plant, and pistils alone in another flower or on"
2009,another plant. In plants under culture and placed under new conditions
2009,"of life, sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs"
2009,become more or less impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in ever
2009,"so slight a degree under nature, then, as pollen is already carried"
2009,"regularly from flower to flower, and as a more complete separation of"
2009,the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of
2009,"the division of labour, individuals with this tendency more and more"
2009,"increased, would be continually favoured or selected, until at last a"
2009,complete separation of the sexes might be effected. It would take up
2009,"too much space to show the various steps, through dimorphism and other"
2009,"means, by which the separation of the sexes in plants of various kinds"
2009,is apparently now in progress; but I may add that some of the species
2009,"of holly in North America are, according to Asa Gray, in an exactly"
2009,"intermediate condition, or, as he expresses it, are more or less"
2009,dioeciously polygamous.
2009,
2009,Let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects; we may suppose the
2009,plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued
2009,"selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects depended in"
2009,main part on its nectar for food. I could give many facts showing how
2009,"anxious bees are to save time: for instance, their habit of cutting"
2009,"holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers, which with"
2009,a very little more trouble they can enter by the mouth. Bearing such
2009,"facts in mind, it may be believed that under certain circumstances"
2009,"individual differences in the curvature or length of the proboscis,"
2009,"etc., too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other"
2009,"insect, so that certain individuals would be able to obtain their"
2009,food more quickly than others; and thus the communities to which they
2009,belonged would flourish and throw off many swarms inheriting the same
2009,peculiarities. The tubes of the corolla of the common red or incarnate
2009,clovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a hasty glance
2009,appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar
2009,"out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red clover, which"
2009,is visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of the red clover
2009,offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee.
2009,That this nectar is much liked by the hive-bee is certain; for I have
2009,"repeatedly seen, but only in the autumn, many hive-bees sucking the"
2009,flowers through holes bitten in the base of the tube by humble bees.
2009,"The difference in the length of the corolla in the two kinds of clover,"
2009,"which determines the visits of the hive-bee, must be very trifling; for"
2009,"I have been assured that when red clover has been mown, the flowers of"
2009,"the second crop are somewhat smaller, and that these are visited by many"
2009,hive-bees. I do not know whether this statement is accurate; nor whether
2009,"another published statement can be trusted, namely, that the Ligurian"
2009,"bee, which is generally considered a mere variety of the common"
2009,"hive-bee, and which freely crosses with it, is able to reach and suck"
2009,"the nectar of the red clover. Thus, in a country where this kind of"
2009,"clover abounded, it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have a"
2009,"slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis. On the other hand,"
2009,as the fertility of this clover absolutely depends on bees visiting the
2009,"flowers, if humble-bees were to become rare in any country, it might be"
2009,a great advantage to the plant to have a shorter or more deeply divided
2009,"corolla, so that the hive-bees should be enabled to suck its flowers."
2009,"Thus I can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either"
2009,"simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted to each"
2009,"other in the most perfect manner, by the continued preservation of all"
2009,the individuals which presented slight deviations of structure mutually
2009,favourable to each other.
2009,
2009,"I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in"
2009,"the above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which"
2009,"were first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's noble views on ""the modern"
2009,"changes of the earth, as illustrative of geology;"" but we now seldom"
2009,"hear the agencies which we see still at work, spoken of as trifling and"
2009,"insignificant, when used in explaining the excavation of the deepest"
2009,valleys or the formation of long lines of inland cliffs. Natural
2009,selection acts only by the preservation and accumulation of small
2009,"inherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and"
2009,as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a
2009,"great valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection banish"
2009,"the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of any"
2009,great and sudden modification in their structure.
2009,
2009,ON THE INTERCROSSING OF INDIVIDUALS.
2009,
2009,I must here introduce a short digression. In the case of animals
2009,"and plants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two"
2009,individuals must always (with the exception of the curious and not well
2009,understood cases of parthenogenesis) unite for each birth; but in the
2009,case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious. Nevertheless there is
2009,"reason to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals, either"
2009,"occasionally or habitually, concur for the reproduction of their kind."
2009,"This view was long ago doubtfully suggested by Sprengel, Knight and"
2009,Kolreuter. We shall presently see its importance; but I must here treat
2009,"the subject with extreme brevity, though I have the materials prepared"
2009,"for an ample discussion. All vertebrate animals, all insects and some"
2009,"other large groups of animals, pair for each birth. Modern research"
2009,has much diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites and of real
2009,"hermaphrodites a large number pair; that is, two individuals regularly"
2009,"unite for reproduction, which is all that concerns us. But still there"
2009,"are many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair,"
2009,"and a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites. What reason, it may be"
2009,"asked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever"
2009,"concur in reproduction? As it is impossible here to enter on details, I"
2009,must trust to some general considerations alone.
2009,
2009,"In the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts, and made"
2009,"so many experiments, showing, in accordance with the almost universal"
2009,"belief of breeders, that with animals and plants a cross between"
2009,"different varieties, or between individuals of the same variety but of"
2009,"another strain, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring; and on the"
2009,"other hand, that CLOSE interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility;"
2009,that these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law
2009,of nature that no organic being fertilises itself for a perpetuity
2009,of generations; but that a cross with another individual is
2009,occasionally--perhaps at long intervals of time--indispensable.
2009,
2009,"On the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think, understand"
2009,"several large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any"
2009,other view are inexplicable. Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable
2009,"exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a"
2009,multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the
2009,"weather! If an occasional cross be indispensable, notwithstanding that"
2009,the plant's own anthers and pistil stand so near each other as almost
2009,"to ensure self-fertilisation, the fullest freedom for the entrance of"
2009,pollen from another individual will explain the above state of exposure
2009,"of the organs. Many flowers, on the other hand, have their organs of"
2009,"fructification closely enclosed, as in the great papilionaceous or"
2009,pea-family; but these almost invariably present beautiful and curious
2009,adaptations in relation to the visits of insects. So necessary are the
2009,"visits of bees to many papilionaceous flowers, that their fertility is"
2009,"greatly diminished if these visits be prevented. Now, it is scarcely"
2009,"possible for insects to fly from flower to flower, and not to carry"
2009,"pollen from one to the other, to the great good of the plant."
2009,"Insects act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is sufficient, to ensure"
2009,"fertilisation, just to touch with the same brush the anthers of one"
2009,flower and then the stigma of another; but it must not be supposed that
2009,bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct species;
2009,for if a plant's own pollen and that from another species are placed
2009,"on the same stigma, the former is so prepotent that it invariably and"
2009,"completely destroys, as has been shown by Gartner, the influence of the"
2009,foreign pollen.
2009,
2009,"When the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or"
2009,"slowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems"
2009,adapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful
2009,for this end: but the agency of insects is often required to cause the
2009,"stamens to spring forward, as Kolreuter has shown to be the case with"
2009,"the barberry; and in this very genus, which seems to have a special"
2009,"contrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known that, if"
2009,"closely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each other, it is"
2009,"hardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do they naturally"
2009,"cross. In numerous other cases, far from self-fertilisation being"
2009,"favoured, there are special contrivances which effectually prevent the"
2009,"stigma receiving pollen from its own flower, as I could show from the"
2009,"works of Sprengel and others, as well as from my own observations: for"
2009,"instance, in Lobelia fulgens, there is a really beautiful and elaborate"
2009,contrivance by which all the infinitely numerous pollen-granules are
2009,"swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower, before the stigma of"
2009,that individual flower is ready to receive them; and as this flower is
2009,"never visited, at least in my garden, by insects, it never sets a seed,"
2009,"though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another, I"
2009,"raise plenty of seedlings. Another species of Lobelia, which is visited"
2009,"by bees, seeds freely in my garden. In very many other cases, though"
2009,there is no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma
2009,"receiving pollen from the same flower, yet, as Sprengel, and more"
2009,"recently Hildebrand and others have shown, and as I can confirm, either"
2009,"the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the"
2009,"stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that"
2009,"these so-named dichogamous plants have in fact separated sexes, and"
2009,must habitually be crossed. So it is with the reciprocally dimorphic and
2009,trimorphic plants previously alluded to. How strange are these facts!
2009,"How strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower,"
2009,"though placed so close together, as if for the very purpose of"
2009,"self-fertilisation, should be in so many cases mutually useless to each"
2009,other! How simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional
2009,cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable!
2009,
2009,"If several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some other"
2009,"plants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority of the"
2009,"seedlings thus raised turn out, as I found, mongrels: for instance, I"
2009,raised  seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties
2009,"growing near each other, and of these only  were true to their kind,"
2009,and some even of these were not perfectly true. Yet the pistil of each
2009,cabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens but by
2009,those of the many other flowers on the same plant; and the pollen of
2009,each flower readily gets on its stigma without insect agency; for I
2009,have found that plants carefully protected from insects produce the
2009,"full number of pods. How, then, comes it that such a vast number of the"
2009,seedlings are mongrelized? It must arise from the pollen of a distinct
2009,VARIETY having a prepotent effect over the flower's own pollen; and
2009,that this is part of the general law of good being derived from the
2009,intercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species. When distinct
2009,"SPECIES are crossed the case is reversed, for a plant's own pollen"
2009,is always prepotent over foreign pollen; but to this subject we shall
2009,return in a future chapter.
2009,
2009,"In the case of a large tree covered with innumerable flowers, it may be"
2009,"objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and at"
2009,most only from flower to flower on the same tree; and flowers on the
2009,same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited
2009,"sense. I believe this objection to be valid, but that nature has largely"
2009,provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers
2009,"with separated sexes. When the sexes are separated, although the male"
2009,"and female flowers may be produced on the same tree, pollen must be"
2009,regularly carried from flower to flower; and this will give a better
2009,chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree. That
2009,trees belonging to all orders have their sexes more often separated than
2009,"other plants, I find to be the case in this country; and at my request"
2009,"Dr. Hooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand, and Dr. Asa Gray those"
2009,"of the United States, and the result was as I anticipated. On the"
2009,"other hand, Dr. Hooker informs me that the rule does not hold good in"
2009,"Australia: but if most of the Australian trees are dichogamous, the same"
2009,result would follow as if they bore flowers with separated sexes. I have
2009,made these few remarks on trees simply to call attention to the subject.
2009,
2009,Turning for a brief space to animals: various terrestrial species are
2009,"hermaphrodites, such as the land-mollusca and earth-worms; but these"
2009,all pair. As yet I have not found a single terrestrial animal which
2009,"can fertilise itself. This remarkable fact, which offers so strong a"
2009,"contrast with terrestrial plants, is intelligible on the view of an"
2009,occasional cross being indispensable; for owing to the nature of the
2009,"fertilising element there are no means, analogous to the action of"
2009,"insects and of the wind with plants, by which an occasional cross could"
2009,be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two
2009,"individuals. Of aquatic animals, there are many self-fertilising"
2009,hermaphrodites; but here the currents of water offer an obvious means
2009,"for an occasional cross. As in the case of flowers, I have as yet"
2009,"failed, after consultation with one of the highest authorities, namely,"
2009,"Professor Huxley, to discover a single hermaphrodite animal with the"
2009,"organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed that access from without,"
2009,"and the occasional influence of a distinct individual, can be shown to"
2009,"be physically impossible. Cirripedes long appeared to me to present,"
2009,"under this point of view, a case of great difficulty; but I have been"
2009,"enabled, by a fortunate chance, to prove that two individuals, though"
2009,"both are self-fertilising hermaphrodites, do sometimes cross."
2009,
2009,"It must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, both"
2009,"with animals and plants, some species of the same family and even of"
2009,"the same genus, though agreeing closely with each other in their whole"
2009,"organisation, are hermaphrodites, and some unisexual. But if, in fact,"
2009,"all hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross, the difference between"
2009,"them and unisexual species is, as far as function is concerned, very"
2009,small.
2009,
2009,From these several considerations and from the many special facts which
2009,"I have collected, but which I am unable here to give, it appears that"
2009,with animals and plants an occasional intercross between distinct
2009,"individuals is a very general, if not universal, law of nature."
2009,
2009,CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NEW FORMS THROUGH NATURAL
2009,SELECTION.
2009,
2009,"This is an extremely intricate subject. A great amount of variability,"
2009,"under which term individual differences are always included, will"
2009,"evidently be favourable. A large number of individuals, by giving a"
2009,better chance within any given period for the appearance of profitable
2009,"variations, will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each"
2009,"individual, and is, I believe, a highly important element of success."
2009,Though nature grants long periods of time for the work of natural
2009,"selection, she does not grant an indefinite period; for as all organic"
2009,"beings are striving to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if"
2009,any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding
2009,degree with its competitors it will be exterminated. Unless favourable
2009,"variations be inherited by some at least of the offspring, nothing can"
2009,be effected by natural selection. The tendency to reversion may often
2009,check or prevent the work; but as this tendency has not prevented man
2009,"from forming by selection numerous domestic races, why should it prevail"
2009,against natural selection?
2009,
2009,"In the case of methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite"
2009,"object, and if the individuals be allowed freely to intercross, his work"
2009,"will completely fail. But when many men, without intending to alter"
2009,"the breed, have a nearly common standard of perfection, and all try to"
2009,"procure and breed from the best animals, improvement surely but slowly"
2009,"follows from this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding that"
2009,there is no separation of selected individuals. Thus it will be under
2009,"nature; for within a confined area, with some place in the natural"
2009,"polity not perfectly occupied, all the individuals varying in the right"
2009,"direction, though in different degrees, will tend to be preserved."
2009,"But if the area be large, its several districts will almost certainly"
2009,"present different conditions of life; and then, if the same species"
2009,"undergoes modification in different districts, the newly formed"
2009,varieties will intercross on the confines of each. But we shall see in
2009,"the sixth chapter that intermediate varieties, inhabiting intermediate"
2009,"districts, will in the long run generally be supplanted by one of the"
2009,adjoining varieties. Intercrossing will chiefly affect those animals
2009,"which unite for each birth and wander much, and which do not breed at a"
2009,"very quick rate. Hence with animals of this nature, for instance birds,"
2009,varieties will generally be confined to separated countries; and this
2009,I find to be the case. With hermaphrodite organisms which cross only
2009,"occasionally, and likewise with animals which unite for each birth, but"
2009,"which wander little and can increase at a rapid rate, a new and improved"
2009,"variety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there"
2009,"maintain itself in a body and afterward spread, so that the individuals"
2009,of the new variety would chiefly cross together. On this principle
2009,"nurserymen always prefer saving seed from a large body of plants, as the"
2009,chance of intercrossing is thus lessened.
2009,
2009,"Even with animals which unite for each birth, and which do not propagate"
2009,"rapidly, we must not assume that free intercrossing would always"
2009,eliminate the effects of natural selection; for I can bring forward
2009,a considerable body of facts showing that within the same area two
2009,"varieties of the same animal may long remain distinct, from haunting"
2009,"different stations, from breeding at slightly different seasons, or from"
2009,the individuals of each variety preferring to pair together.
2009,
2009,Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature by keeping the
2009,"individuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and"
2009,uniform in character. It will obviously thus act far more efficiently
2009,"with those animals which unite for each birth; but, as already stated,"
2009,we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place with
2009,all animals and plants. Even if these take place only at long intervals
2009,"of time, the young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and"
2009,"fertility over the offspring from long-continued self-fertilisation,"
2009,that they will have a better chance of surviving and propagating their
2009,"kind; and thus in the long run the influence of crosses, even at rare"
2009,"intervals, will be great. With respect to organic beings extremely low"
2009,"in the scale, which do not propagate sexually, nor conjugate, and which"
2009,"cannot possibly intercross, uniformity of character can be retained by"
2009,"them under the same conditions of life, only through the principle"
2009,"of inheritance, and through natural selection which will destroy any"
2009,individuals departing from the proper type. If the conditions of life
2009,"change and the form undergoes modification, uniformity of character"
2009,"can be given to the modified offspring, solely by natural selection"
2009,preserving similar favourable variations.
2009,
2009,Isolation also is an important element in the modification of species
2009,"through natural selection. In a confined or isolated area, if not very"
2009,"large, the organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be"
2009,almost uniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all
2009,the varying individuals of the same species in the same manner.
2009,"Intercrossing with the inhabitants of the surrounding districts,"
2009,will also be thus prevented. Moritz Wagner has lately published an
2009,"interesting essay on this subject, and has shown that the service"
2009,rendered by isolation in preventing crosses between newly-formed
2009,varieties is probably greater even than I supposed. But from reasons
2009,"already assigned I can by no means agree with this naturalist, that"
2009,migration and isolation are necessary elements for the formation of new
2009,"species. The importance of isolation is likewise great in preventing,"
2009,"after any physical change in the conditions, such as of climate,"
2009,"elevation of the land, etc., the immigration of better adapted"
2009,organisms; and thus new places in the natural economy of the district
2009,will be left open to be filled up by the modification of the old
2009,"inhabitants. Lastly, isolation will give time for a new variety to be"
2009,improved at a slow rate; and this may sometimes be of much importance.
2009,"If, however, an isolated area be very small, either from being"
2009,"surrounded by barriers, or from having very peculiar physical"
2009,"conditions, the total number of the inhabitants will be small; and this"
2009,"will retard the production of new species through natural selection, by"
2009,decreasing the chances of favourable variations arising.
2009,
2009,"The mere lapse of time by itself does nothing, either for or against"
2009,natural selection. I state this because it has been erroneously asserted
2009,that the element of time has been assumed by me to play an all-important
2009,"part in modifying species, as if all the forms of life were necessarily"
2009,undergoing change through some innate law. Lapse of time is only so far
2009,"important, and its importance in this respect is great, that it gives"
2009,a better chance of beneficial variations arising and of their being
2009,"selected, accumulated, and fixed. It likewise tends to increase the"
2009,"direct action of the physical conditions of life, in relation to the"
2009,constitution of each organism.
2009,
2009,"If we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at any"
2009,"small isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the number of"
2009,"the species inhabiting it is small, as we shall see in our chapter on"
2009,Geographical Distribution; yet of these species a very large proportion
2009,"are endemic,--that is, have been produced there and nowhere else in the"
2009,world. Hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly
2009,favourable for the production of new species. But we may thus deceive
2009,"ourselves, for to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a large"
2009,"open area like a continent, has been most favourable for the production"
2009,"of new organic forms, we ought to make the comparison within equal"
2009,times; and this we are incapable of doing.
2009,
2009,Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new
2009,"species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area"
2009,"is still more important, especially for the production of species which"
2009,"shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading"
2009,"widely. Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a"
2009,"better chance of favourable variations, arising from the large number of"
2009,"individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of"
2009,life are much more complex from the large number of already existing
2009,"species; and if some of these many species become modified and improved,"
2009,"others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they"
2009,"will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been much"
2009,"improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and"
2009,"will thus come into competition with many other forms. Moreover, great"
2009,"areas, though now continuous, will often, owing to former oscillations"
2009,"of level, have existed in a broken condition, so that the good effects"
2009,"of isolation will generally, to a certain extent, have concurred."
2009,"Finally, I conclude that, although small isolated areas have been in"
2009,"some respects highly favourable for the production of new species, yet"
2009,that the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on
2009,"large areas; and what is more important, that the new forms produced on"
2009,"large areas, which already have been victorious over many competitors,"
2009,"will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the"
2009,greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more
2009,important part in the changing history of the organic world.
2009,
2009,"In accordance with this view, we can, perhaps, understand some"
2009,facts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on Geographical
2009,"Distribution; for instance, the fact of the productions of the"
2009,smaller continent of Australia now yielding before those of the larger
2009,"Europaeo-Asiatic area. Thus, also, it is that continental productions"
2009,have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands. On a small
2009,"island, the race for life will have been less severe, and there will"
2009,"have been less modification and less extermination. Hence, we can"
2009,"understand how it is that the flora of Madeira, according to Oswald"
2009,"Heer, resembles to a certain extent the extinct tertiary flora of"
2009,"Europe. All fresh water basins, taken together, make a small area"
2009,"compared with that of the sea or of the land. Consequently, the"
2009,competition between fresh water productions will have been less severe
2009,"than elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly produced, and old"
2009,forms more slowly exterminated. And it is in fresh water basins that
2009,"we find seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant"
2009,order: and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now
2009,"known in the world, as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, which, like"
2009,"fossils, connect to a certain extent orders at present widely separated"
2009,in the natural scale. These anomalous forms may be called living
2009,"fossils; they have endured to the present day, from having inhabited"
2009,"a confined area, and from having been exposed to less varied, and"
2009,"therefore less severe, competition."
2009,
2009,"To sum up, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits, the"
2009,circumstances favourable and unfavourable for the production of new
2009,species through natural selection. I conclude that for terrestrial
2009,"productions a large continental area, which has undergone many"
2009,"oscillations of level, will have been the most favourable for the"
2009,"production of many new forms of life, fitted to endure for a long"
2009,time and to spread widely. While the area existed as a continent the
2009,"inhabitants will have been numerous in individuals and kinds, and will"
2009,have been subjected to severe competition. When converted by subsidence
2009,into large separate islands there will still have existed many
2009,individuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the
2009,confines of the range of each new species will have been checked: after
2009,"physical changes of any kind immigration will have been prevented, so"
2009,that new places in the polity of each island will have had to be filled
2009,up by the modification of the old inhabitants; and time will have been
2009,allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected.
2009,"When, by renewed elevation, the islands were reconverted into a"
2009,"continental area, there will again have been very severe competition;"
2009,the most favoured or improved varieties will have been enabled to
2009,"spread; there will have been much extinction of the less improved forms,"
2009,and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the
2009,reunited continent will again have been changed; and again there will
2009,have been a fair field for natural selection to improve still further
2009,"the inhabitants, and thus to produce new species."
2009,
2009,That natural selection generally act with extreme slowness I fully
2009,admit. It can act only when there are places in the natural polity of a
2009,district which can be better occupied by the modification of some of its
2009,existing inhabitants. The occurrence of such places will often depend
2009,"on physical changes, which generally take place very slowly, and on the"
2009,immigration of better adapted forms being prevented. As some few of
2009,the old inhabitants become modified the mutual relations of others will
2009,"often be disturbed; and this will create new places, ready to be filled"
2009,up by better adapted forms; but all this will take place very slowly.
2009,Although all the individuals of the same species differ in some slight
2009,"degree from each other, it would often be long before differences of"
2009,the right nature in various parts of the organisation might occur. The
2009,result would often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing. Many will
2009,exclaim that these several causes are amply sufficient to neutralise the
2009,power of natural selection. I do not believe so. But I do believe that
2009,"natural selection will generally act very slowly, only at long intervals"
2009,"of time, and only on a few of the inhabitants of the same region. I"
2009,"further believe that these slow, intermittent results accord well with"
2009,what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of
2009,the world have changed.
2009,
2009,"Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much"
2009,"by artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change,"
2009,to the beauty and complexity of the coadaptations between all organic
2009,"beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life,"
2009,which may have been effected in the long course of time through nature's
2009,"power of selection, that is by the survival of the fittest."
2009,
2009,EXTINCTION CAUSED BY NATURAL SELECTION.
2009,
2009,This subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on Geology; but
2009,it must here be alluded to from being intimately connected with natural
2009,selection. Natural selection acts solely through the preservation of
2009,"variations in some way advantageous, which consequently endure. Owing to"
2009,"the high geometrical rate of increase of all organic beings, each area"
2009,"is already fully stocked with inhabitants, and it follows from this,"
2009,"that as the favoured forms increase in number, so, generally, will the"
2009,"less favoured decrease and become rare. Rarity, as geology tells us,"
2009,is the precursor to extinction. We can see that any form which
2009,is represented by few individuals will run a good chance of utter
2009,"extinction, during great fluctuations in the nature or the seasons, or"
2009,from a temporary increase in the number of its enemies. But we may go
2009,"further than this; for as new forms are produced, unless we admit that"
2009,"specific forms can go on indefinitely increasing in number, many old"
2009,forms must become extinct. That the number of specific forms has not
2009,"indefinitely increased, geology plainly tells us; and we shall presently"
2009,attempt to show why it is that the number of species throughout the
2009,world has not become immeasurably great.
2009,
2009,We have seen that the species which are most numerous in individuals
2009,have the best chance of producing favourable variations within any given
2009,"period. We have evidence of this, in the facts stated in the second"
2009,"chapter, showing that it is the common and diffused or dominant species"
2009,"which offer the greatest number of recorded varieties. Hence, rare"
2009,species will be less quickly modified or improved within any given
2009,period; they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the
2009,modified and improved descendants of the commoner species.
2009,
2009,"From these several considerations I think it inevitably follows,"
2009,that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural
2009,"selection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct."
2009,The forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing
2009,"modification and improvement, will naturally suffer most. And we have"
2009,seen in the chapter on the Struggle for Existence that it is the most
2009,"closely-allied forms,--varieties of the same species, and species of"
2009,"the same genus or related genera,--which, from having nearly the same"
2009,"structure, constitution and habits, generally come into the severest"
2009,"competition with each other. Consequently, each new variety or species,"
2009,"during the progress of its formation, will generally press hardest"
2009,"on its nearest kindred, and tend to exterminate them. We see the same"
2009,"process of extermination among our domesticated productions, through"
2009,the selection of improved forms by man. Many curious instances could be
2009,"given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle, sheep and other animals,"
2009,"and varieties of flowers, take the place of older and inferior kinds. In"
2009,"Yorkshire, it is historically known that the ancient black cattle were"
2009,"displaced by the long-horns, and that these ""were swept away by the"
2009,"short-horns"" (I quote the words of an agricultural writer) ""as if by"
2009,"some murderous pestilence."""
2009,
2009,DIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER.
2009,
2009,"The principle, which I have designated by this term, is of high"
2009,"importance, and explains, as I believe, several important facts. In"
2009,"the first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though having"
2009,somewhat of the character of species--as is shown by the hopeless doubts
2009,in many cases how to rank them--yet certainly differ far less from each
2009,other than do good and distinct species. Nevertheless according to my
2009,"view, varieties are species in the process of formation, or are, as"
2009,"I have called them, incipient species. How, then, does the lesser"
2009,difference between varieties become augmented into the greater
2009,"difference between species? That this does habitually happen, we must"
2009,infer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting
2009,"well-marked differences; whereas varieties, the supposed prototypes and"
2009,"parents of future well-marked species, present slight and ill-defined"
2009,"differences. Mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one variety"
2009,"to differ in some character from its parents, and the offspring of this"
2009,variety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and
2009,in a greater degree; but this alone would never account for so habitual
2009,and large a degree of difference as that between the species of the same
2009,genus.
2009,
2009,"As has always been my practice, I have sought light on this head from"
2009,our domestic productions. We shall here find something analogous. It
2009,will be admitted that the production of races so different as short-horn
2009,"and Hereford cattle, race and cart horses, the several breeds of"
2009,"pigeons, etc., could never have been effected by the mere chance"
2009,accumulation of similar variations during many successive generations.
2009,"In practice, a fancier is, for instance, struck by a pigeon having a"
2009,slightly shorter beak; another fancier is struck by a pigeon having a
2009,"rather longer beak; and on the acknowledged principle that ""fanciers do"
2009,"not and will not admire a medium standard, but like extremes,"" they"
2009,both go on (as has actually occurred with the sub-breeds of the
2009,tumbler-pigeon) choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer
2009,"beaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks. Again, we may suppose that at"
2009,"an early period of history, the men of one nation or district required"
2009,"swifter horses, while those of another required stronger and bulkier"
2009,"horses. The early differences would be very slight; but, in the course"
2009,"of time, from the continued selection of swifter horses in the one case,"
2009,"and of stronger ones in the other, the differences would become greater,"
2009,and would be noted as forming two sub-breeds. Ultimately after the
2009,"lapse of centuries, these sub-breeds would become converted into two"
2009,"well-established and distinct breeds. As the differences became greater,"
2009,"the inferior animals with intermediate characters, being neither very"
2009,"swift nor very strong, would not have been used for breeding, and will"
2009,"thus have tended to disappear. Here, then, we see in man's productions"
2009,"the action of what may be called the principle of divergence, causing"
2009,"differences, at first barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and"
2009,"the breeds to diverge in character, both from each other and from their"
2009,common parent.
2009,
2009,"But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature?"
2009,I believe it can and does apply most efficiently (though it was a long
2009,"time before I saw how), from the simple circumstance that the more"
2009,"diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure,"
2009,"constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to"
2009,"seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and"
2009,so be enabled to increase in numbers.
2009,
2009,We can clearly discern this in the case of animals with simple habits.
2009,"Take the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can"
2009,be supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average.
2009,"If its natural power of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in"
2009,increasing (the country not undergoing any change in conditions) only by
2009,its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by other
2009,"animals: some of them, for instance, being enabled to feed on new kinds"
2009,"of prey, either dead or alive; some inhabiting new stations, climbing"
2009,"trees, frequenting water, and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous."
2009,The more diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our
2009,"carnivorous animals become, the more places they will be enabled to"
2009,occupy. What applies to one animal will apply throughout all time to
2009,"all animals--that is, if they vary--for otherwise natural selection can"
2009,effect nothing. So it will be with plants. It has been experimentally
2009,"proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass,"
2009,"and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses,"
2009,a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can be
2009,raised in the latter than in the former case. The same has been found
2009,to hold good when one variety and several mixed varieties of wheat have
2009,"been sown on equal spaces of ground. Hence, if any one species of grass"
2009,"were to go on varying, and the varieties were continually selected which"
2009,"differed from each other in the same manner, though in a very slight"
2009,"degree, as do the distinct species and genera of grasses, a greater"
2009,"number of individual plants of this species, including its modified"
2009,"descendants, would succeed in living on the same piece of ground. And"
2009,we know that each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing
2009,"almost countless seeds; and is thus striving, as it may be said, to"
2009,"the utmost to increase in number. Consequently, in the course of many"
2009,"thousand generations, the most distinct varieties of any one species"
2009,of grass would have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing
2009,"in numbers, and thus of supplanting the less distinct varieties; and"
2009,"varieties, when rendered very distinct from each other, take the rank of"
2009,species.
2009,
2009,The truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can be
2009,"supported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many"
2009,"natural circumstances. In an extremely small area, especially if freely"
2009,"open to immigration, and where the contest between individual and"
2009,"individual must be very severe, we always find great diversity in its"
2009,"inhabitants. For instance, I found that a piece of turf, three feet by"
2009,"four in size, which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same"
2009,"conditions, supported twenty species of plants, and these belonged to"
2009,"eighteen genera and to eight orders, which shows how much these plants"
2009,differed from each other. So it is with the plants and insects on small
2009,and uniform islets: also in small ponds of fresh water. Farmers find
2009,that they can raise more food by a rotation of plants belonging to the
2009,most different orders: nature follows what may be called a simultaneous
2009,rotation. Most of the animals and plants which live close round any
2009,"small piece of ground, could live on it (supposing its nature not to be"
2009,"in any way peculiar), and may be said to be striving to the utmost"
2009,"to live there; but, it is seen, that where they come into the closest"
2009,"competition, the advantages of diversification of structure, with the"
2009,"accompanying differences of habit and constitution, determine that the"
2009,"inhabitants, which thus jostle each other most closely, shall, as a"
2009,"general rule, belong to what we call different genera and orders."
2009,
2009,The same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through man's
2009,agency in foreign lands. It might have been expected that the plants
2009,which would succeed in becoming naturalised in any land would generally
2009,have been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are commonly looked
2009,at as specially created and adapted for their own country. It might
2009,"also, perhaps, have been expected that naturalised plants would have"
2009,belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in
2009,their new homes. But the case is very different; and Alph. de Candolle
2009,"has well remarked, in his great and admirable work, that floras gain by"
2009,"naturalisation, proportionally with the number of the native genera and"
2009,"species, far more in new genera than in new species. To give a single"
2009,"instance: in the last edition of Dr. Asa Gray's ""Manual of the Flora of"
2009,"the Northern United States,""  naturalised plants are enumerated, and"
2009,these belong to  genera. We thus see that these naturalised plants
2009,"are of a highly diversified nature. They differ, moreover, to a large"
2009,"extent, from the indigenes, for out of the  naturalised genera,"
2009,"no less than  genera are not there indigenous, and thus a large"
2009,proportional addition is made to the genera now living in the United
2009,States.
2009,
2009,By considering the nature of the plants or animals which have in any
2009,"country struggled successfully with the indigenes, and have there become"
2009,"naturalised, we may gain some crude idea in what manner some of the"
2009,natives would have had to be modified in order to gain an advantage over
2009,their compatriots; and we may at least infer that diversification of
2009,"structure, amounting to new generic differences, would be profitable to"
2009,them.
2009,
2009,The advantage of diversification of structure in the inhabitants of the
2009,"same region is, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division"
2009,of labour in the organs of the same individual body--a subject so well
2009,elucidated by Milne Edwards. No physiologist doubts that a stomach by
2009,"being adapted to digest vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws"
2009,most nutriment from these substances. So in the general economy of
2009,"any land, the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are"
2009,"diversified for different habits of life, so will a greater number of"
2009,"individuals be capable of there supporting themselves. A set of animals,"
2009,"with their organisation but little diversified, could hardly compete"
2009,"with a set more perfectly diversified in structure. It may be doubted,"
2009,"for instance, whether the Australian marsupials, which are divided into"
2009,"groups differing but little from each other, and feebly representing, as"
2009,"Mr. Waterhouse and others have remarked, our carnivorous, ruminant, and"
2009,"rodent mammals, could successfully compete with these well-developed"
2009,"orders. In the Australian mammals, we see the process of diversification"
2009,in an early and incomplete stage of development.
2009,
2009,THE PROBABLE EFFECTS OF THE ACTION OF NATURAL SELECTION THROUGH
2009,"DIVERGENCE OF CHARACTER AND EXTINCTION, ON THE DESCENDANTS OF A COMMON"
2009,ANCESTOR.
2009,
2009,"After the foregoing discussion, which has been much compressed, we may"
2009,assume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed so
2009,"much the better as they become more diversified in structure, and are"
2009,thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings. Now let
2009,us see how this principle of benefit being derived from divergence of
2009,"character, combined with the principles of natural selection and of"
2009,"extinction, tends to act."
2009,
2009,The accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather
2009,perplexing subject. Let A to L represent the species of a genus large
2009,in its own country; these species are supposed to resemble each other
2009,"in unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature, and as is"
2009,represented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances.
2009,"I have said a large genus, because as we saw in the second chapter, on"
2009,an average more species vary in large genera than in small genera; and
2009,the varying species of the large genera present a greater number of
2009,"varieties. We have, also, seen that the species, which are the commonest"
2009,"and most widely-diffused, vary more than do the rare and restricted"
2009,"species. Let (A) be a common, widely-diffused, and varying species,"
2009,belonging to a genus large in its own country. The branching and
2009,"diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from (A), may"
2009,represent its varying offspring. The variations are supposed to be
2009,"extremely slight, but of the most diversified nature; they are not"
2009,"supposed all to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals of"
2009,time; nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods. Only
2009,those variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or
2009,naturally selected. And here the importance of the principle of benefit
2009,derived from divergence of character comes in; for this will generally
2009,lead to the most different or divergent variations (represented by
2009,the outer dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated by natural
2009,"selection. When a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines,"
2009,"and is there marked by a small numbered letter, a sufficient amount of"
2009,variation is supposed to have been accumulated to form it into a fairly
2009,"well-marked variety, such as would be thought worthy of record in a"
2009,systematic work.
2009,
2009,"The intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may represent"
2009,"each a thousand or more generations. After a thousand generations,"
2009,species (A) is supposed to have produced two fairly well-marked
2009,"varieties, namely a and m. These two varieties will generally still"
2009,"be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable, and"
2009,the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary; consequently they
2009,"will likewise tend to vary, and commonly in nearly the same manner as"
2009,"did their parents. Moreover, these two varieties, being only slightly"
2009,"modified forms, will tend to inherit those advantages which made their"
2009,parent (A) more numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same
2009,country; they will also partake of those more general advantages which
2009,"made the genus to which the parent-species belonged, a large genus"
2009,in its own country. And all these circumstances are favourable to the
2009,production of new varieties.
2009,
2009,"If, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of"
2009,their variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand
2009,"generations. And after this interval, variety a is supposed in the"
2009,"diagram to have produced variety a, which will, owing to the principle"
2009,"of divergence, differ more from (A) than did variety a. Variety m is"
2009,"supposed to have produced two varieties, namely m and s, differing"
2009,"from each other, and more considerably from their common parent (A). We"
2009,may continue the process by similar steps for any length of time; some
2009,"of the varieties, after each thousand generations, producing only"
2009,"a single variety, but in a more and more modified condition, some"
2009,"producing two or three varieties, and some failing to produce any. Thus"
2009,"the varieties or modified descendants of the common parent (A), will"
2009,generally go on increasing in number and diverging in character. In the
2009,"diagram the process is represented up to the ten-thousandth generation,"
2009,and under a condensed and simplified form up to the fourteen-thousandth
2009,generation.
2009,
2009,But I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes
2009,"on so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself made"
2009,"somewhat irregular, nor that it goes on continuously; it is far more"
2009,"probable that each form remains for long periods unaltered, and then"
2009,again undergoes modification. Nor do I suppose that the most divergent
2009,"varieties are invariably preserved: a medium form may often long endure,"
2009,and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant; for
2009,natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places
2009,which are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings;
2009,and this will depend on infinitely complex relations. But as a general
2009,"rule, the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one"
2009,"species can be rendered, the more places they will be enabled to seize"
2009,"on, and the more their modified progeny will increase. In our diagram"
2009,the line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered
2009,letters marking the successive forms which have become sufficiently
2009,"distinct to be recorded as varieties. But these breaks are imaginary,"
2009,"and might have been inserted anywhere, after intervals long enough to"
2009,allow the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent variation.
2009,
2009,As all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused
2009,"species, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the"
2009,"same advantages which made their parent successful in life, they will"
2009,generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character:
2009,this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches
2009,proceeding from (A). The modified offspring from the later and more
2009,"highly improved branches in the lines of descent, will, it is probable,"
2009,"often take the place of, and so destroy, the earlier and less improved"
2009,branches: this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower
2009,branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines. In some cases no
2009,doubt the process of modification will be confined to a single line of
2009,"descent, and the number of modified descendants will not be increased;"
2009,although the amount of divergent modification may have been augmented.
2009,"This case would be represented in the diagram, if all the lines"
2009,"proceeding from (A) were removed, excepting that from a to a. In the"
2009,same way the English racehorse and English pointer have apparently
2009,"both gone on slowly diverging in character from their original stocks,"
2009,without either having given off any fresh branches or races.
2009,
2009,"After ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced"
2009,"three forms, a, f, and m, which, from having diverged in character"
2009,"during the successive generations, will have come to differ largely, but"
2009,"perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common parent. If we"
2009,suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram
2009,"to be excessively small, these three forms may still be only well-marked"
2009,varieties; but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of
2009,"modification to be more numerous or greater in amount, to convert these"
2009,three forms into doubtful or at least into well-defined species:
2009,thus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences
2009,distinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences
2009,distinguishing species. By continuing the same process for a greater
2009,number of generations (as shown in the diagram in a condensed and
2009,"simplified manner), we get eight species, marked by the letters between"
2009,"a and m, all descended from (A). Thus, as I believe, species are"
2009,multiplied and genera are formed.
2009,
2009,In a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary.
2009,"In the diagram I have assumed that a second species (I) has produced, by"
2009,"analogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either two well-marked"
2009,"varieties (w and z) or two species, according to the amount of"
2009,change supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines. After
2009,"fourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by the letters"
2009,"n to z, are supposed to have been produced. In any genus, the"
2009,species which are already very different in character from each
2009,"other, will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified"
2009,descendants; for these will have the best chance of seizing on new and
2009,widely different places in the polity of nature: hence in the diagram I
2009,"have chosen the extreme species (A), and the nearly extreme species (I),"
2009,"as those which have largely varied, and have given rise to new varieties"
2009,and species. The other nine species (marked by capital letters) of our
2009,"original genus, may for long but unequal periods continue to transmit"
2009,unaltered descendants; and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted
2009,lines unequally prolonged upwards.
2009,
2009,"But during the process of modification, represented in the diagram,"
2009,"another of our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played"
2009,an important part. As in each fully stocked country natural selection
2009,necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the
2009,"struggle for life over other forms, there will be a constant tendency in"
2009,the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate
2009,in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original
2009,progenitor. For it should be remembered that the competition will
2009,generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly
2009,"related to each other in habits, constitution and structure. Hence all"
2009,"the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states, that is"
2009,"between the less and more improved states of a the same species, as well"
2009,"as the original parent-species itself, will generally tend to become"
2009,extinct. So it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of
2009,"descent, which will be conquered by later and improved lines. If,"
2009,"however, the modified offspring of a species get into some distinct"
2009,"country, or become quickly adapted to some quite new station, in which"
2009,"offspring and progenitor do not come into competition, both may continue"
2009,to exist.
2009,
2009,"If, then, our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of"
2009,"modification, species (A) and all the earlier varieties will have become"
2009,"extinct, being replaced by eight new species (a to m); and species"
2009,(I) will be replaced by six (n to z) new species.
2009,
2009,But we may go further than this. The original species of our genus were
2009,"supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally"
2009,"the case in nature; species (A) being more nearly related to B, C, and"
2009,"D than to the other species; and species (I) more to G, H, K, L, than to"
2009,"the others. These two species (A and I), were also supposed to be very"
2009,"common and widely diffused species, so that they must originally have"
2009,had some advantage over most of the other species of the genus. Their
2009,"modified descendants, fourteen in number at the fourteen-thousandth"
2009,"generation, will probably have inherited some of the same advantages:"
2009,they have also been modified and improved in a diversified manner at
2009,"each stage of descent, so as to have become adapted to many related"
2009,"places in the natural economy of their country. It seems, therefore,"
2009,"extremely probable that they will have taken the places of, and thus"
2009,"exterminated, not only their parents (A) and (I), but likewise some of"
2009,the original species which were most nearly related to their parents.
2009,Hence very few of the original species will have transmitted offspring
2009,to the fourteen-thousandth generation. We may suppose that only one (F)
2009,of the two species (E and F) which were least closely related to the
2009,"other nine original species, has transmitted descendants to this late"
2009,stage of descent.
2009,
2009,"The new species in our diagram, descended from the original eleven"
2009,"species, will now be fifteen in number. Owing to the divergent tendency"
2009,"of natural selection, the extreme amount of difference in character"
2009,between species a and z will be much greater than that between the
2009,"most distinct of the original eleven species. The new species, moreover,"
2009,will be allied to each other in a widely different manner. Of the eight
2009,"descendants from (A) the three marked a, q, p, will be nearly"
2009,"related from having recently branched off from a; b and f, from"
2009,"having diverged at an earlier period from a, will be in some degree"
2009,"distinct from the three first-named species; and lastly, o, e, and"
2009,"m, will be nearly related one to the other, but, from having diverged"
2009,"at the first commencement of the process of modification, will be widely"
2009,"different from the other five species, and may constitute a sub-genus or"
2009,a distinct genus.
2009,
2009,The six descendants from (I) will form two sub-genera or genera. But as
2009,"the original species (I) differed largely from (A), standing nearly"
2009,"at the extreme end of the original genus, the six descendants from (I)"
2009,"will, owing to inheritance alone, differ considerably from the eight"
2009,"descendants from (A); the two groups, moreover, are supposed to have"
2009,"gone on diverging in different directions. The intermediate species,"
2009,"also (and this is a very important consideration), which connected the"
2009,"original species (A) and (I), have all become, except (F), extinct, and"
2009,have left no descendants. Hence the six new species descended from
2009,"(I), and the eight descendants from (A), will have to be ranked as very"
2009,"distinct genera, or even as distinct sub-families."
2009,
2009,"Thus it is, as I believe, that two or more genera are produced by"
2009,"descent with modification, from two or more species of the same genus."
2009,And the two or more parent-species are supposed to be descended from
2009,some one species of an earlier genus. In our diagram this is indicated
2009,"by the broken lines beneath the capital letters, converging in"
2009,sub-branches downwards towards a single point; this point represents
2009,"a species, the supposed progenitor of our several new sub-genera and"
2009,genera.
2009,
2009,It is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new
2009,"species F, which is supposed not to have diverged much in character,"
2009,"but to have retained the form of (F), either unaltered or altered only"
2009,in a slight degree. In this case its affinities to the other fourteen
2009,new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature. Being descended
2009,"from a form that stood between the parent-species (A) and (I),"
2009,"now supposed to be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree"
2009,intermediate in character between the two groups descended from these
2009,two species. But as these two groups have gone on diverging in character
2009,"from the type of their parents, the new species (F) will not be"
2009,"directly intermediate between them, but rather between types of the two"
2009,groups; and every naturalist will be able to call such cases before his
2009,mind.
2009,
2009,In the diagram each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to
2009,"represent a thousand generations, but each may represent a million or"
2009,more generations; it may also represent a section of the successive
2009,"strata of the earth's crust including extinct remains. We shall, when we"
2009,"come to our chapter on geology, have to refer again to this subject,"
2009,and I think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the
2009,"affinities of extinct beings, which, though generally belonging to the"
2009,"same orders, families, or genera, with those now living, yet are often,"
2009,"in some degree, intermediate in character between existing groups; and"
2009,"we can understand this fact, for the extinct species lived at various"
2009,remote epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less.
2009,
2009,"I see no reason to limit the process of modification, as now explained,"
2009,"to the formation of genera alone. If, in the diagram, we suppose the"
2009,amount of change represented by each successive group of diverging
2009,"dotted lines to be great, the forms marked a to p, those marked"
2009,"b and f, and those marked o to m, will form three very distinct"
2009,"genera. We shall also have two very distinct genera descended from (I),"
2009,differing widely from the descendants of (A). These two groups of genera
2009,"will thus form two distinct families, or orders, according to the amount"
2009,of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram. And
2009,"the two new families, or orders, are descended from two species of the"
2009,original genus; and these are supposed to be descended from some still
2009,more ancient and unknown form.
2009,
2009,We have seen that in each country it is the species belonging to the
2009,larger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species.
2009,"This, indeed, might have been expected; for as natural selection acts"
2009,through one form having some advantage over other forms in the struggle
2009,"for existence, it will chiefly act on those which already have some"
2009,advantage; and the largeness of any group shows that its species have
2009,"inherited from a common ancestor some advantage in common. Hence, the"
2009,struggle for the production of new and modified descendants will mainly
2009,"lie between the larger groups, which are all trying to increase in"
2009,"number. One large group will slowly conquer another large group,"
2009,"reduce its number, and thus lessen its chance of further variation and"
2009,"improvement. Within the same large group, the later and more highly"
2009,"perfected sub-groups, from branching out and seizing on many new places"
2009,"in the polity of nature, will constantly tend to supplant and destroy"
2009,the earlier and less improved sub-groups. Small and broken groups and
2009,"sub-groups will finally disappear. Looking to the future, we can predict"
2009,"that the groups of organic beings which are now large and triumphant,"
2009,"and which are least broken up, that is, which have as yet suffered least"
2009,"extinction, will, for a long period, continue to increase. But which"
2009,"groups will ultimately prevail, no man can predict; for we know that"
2009,"many groups, formerly most extensively developed, have now become"
2009,"extinct. Looking still more remotely to the future, we may predict"
2009,"that, owing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups,"
2009,"a multitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and leave no"
2009,"modified descendants; and consequently that, of the species living at"
2009,"any one period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote"
2009,futurity. I shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on
2009,"classification, but I may add that as, according to this view, extremely"
2009,few of the more ancient species have transmitted descendants to the
2009,"present day, and, as all the descendants of the same species form a"
2009,"class, we can understand how it is that there exist so few classes in"
2009,each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Although few of
2009,"the most ancient species have left modified descendants, yet, at remote"
2009,"geological periods, the earth may have been almost as well peopled with"
2009,"species of many genera, families, orders and classes, as at the present"
2009,day.
2009,
2009,ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH ORGANISATION TENDS TO ADVANCE.
2009,
2009,Natural selection acts exclusively by the preservation and accumulation
2009,"of variations, which are beneficial under the organic and inorganic"
2009,conditions to which each creature is exposed at all periods of life.
2009,The ultimate result is that each creature tends to become more and more
2009,improved in relation to its conditions. This improvement inevitably
2009,leads to the gradual advancement of the organisation of the greater
2009,number of living beings throughout the world. But here we enter on a
2009,"very intricate subject, for naturalists have not defined to each other's"
2009,satisfaction what is meant by an advance in organisation. Among the
2009,vertebrata the degree of intellect and an approach in structure to man
2009,clearly come into play. It might be thought that the amount of change
2009,which the various parts and organs pass through in their development
2009,from embryo to maturity would suffice as a standard of comparison; but
2009,"there are cases, as with certain parasitic crustaceans, in which several"
2009,"parts of the structure become less perfect, so that the mature animal"
2009,cannot be called higher than its larva. Von Baer's standard seems
2009,"the most widely applicable and the best, namely, the amount of"
2009,"differentiation of the parts of the same organic being, in the adult"
2009,"state, as I should be inclined to add, and their specialisation"
2009,"for different functions; or, as Milne Edwards would express it, the"
2009,completeness of the division of physiological labour. But we shall see
2009,"how obscure this subject is if we look, for instance, to fishes, among"
2009,"which some naturalists rank those as highest which, like the sharks,"
2009,approach nearest to amphibians; while other naturalists rank the common
2009,"bony or teleostean fishes as the highest, inasmuch as they are most"
2009,"strictly fish-like, and differ most from the other vertebrate classes."
2009,We see still more plainly the obscurity of the subject by turning
2009,"to plants, among which the standard of intellect is of course quite"
2009,excluded; and here some botanists rank those plants as highest which
2009,"have every organ, as sepals, petals, stamens and pistils, fully"
2009,"developed in each flower; whereas other botanists, probably with more"
2009,"truth, look at the plants which have their several organs much modified"
2009,and reduced in number as the highest.
2009,
2009,"If we take as the standard of high organisation, the amount of"
2009,differentiation and specialisation of the several organs in each being
2009,when adult (and this will include the advancement of the brain for
2009,"intellectual purposes), natural selection clearly leads towards this"
2009,"standard: for all physiologists admit that the specialisation of organs,"
2009,"inasmuch as in this state they perform their functions better, is"
2009,an advantage to each being; and hence the accumulation of variations
2009,tending towards specialisation is within the scope of natural selection.
2009,"On the other hand, we can see, bearing in mind that all organic"
2009,beings are striving to increase at a high ratio and to seize on every
2009,"unoccupied or less well occupied place in the economy of nature, that"
2009,it is quite possible for natural selection gradually to fit a being to
2009,a situation in which several organs would be superfluous or useless: in
2009,such cases there would be retrogression in the scale of organisation.
2009,Whether organisation on the whole has actually advanced from the
2009,remotest geological periods to the present day will be more conveniently
2009,discussed in our chapter on Geological Succession.
2009,
2009,But it may be objected that if all organic beings thus tend to rise in
2009,"the scale, how is it that throughout the world a multitude of the lowest"
2009,forms still exist; and how is it that in each great class some forms
2009,are far more highly developed than others? Why have not the more highly
2009,developed forms every where supplanted and exterminated the lower?
2009,"Lamarck, who believed in an innate and inevitable tendency towards"
2009,"perfection in all organic beings, seems to have felt this difficulty"
2009,so strongly that he was led to suppose that new and simple forms are
2009,continually being produced by spontaneous generation. Science has not as
2009,"yet proved the truth of this belief, whatever the future may reveal."
2009,On our theory the continued existence of lowly organisms offers no
2009,"difficulty; for natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does"
2009,not necessarily include progressive development--it only takes advantage
2009,of such variations as arise and are beneficial to each creature under
2009,"its complex relations of life. And it may be asked what advantage,"
2009,"as far as we can see, would it be to an infusorian animalcule--to an"
2009,"intestinal worm--or even to an earth-worm, to be highly organised. If"
2009,"it were no advantage, these forms would be left, by natural selection,"
2009,"unimproved or but little improved, and might remain for indefinite ages"
2009,in their present lowly condition. And geology tells us that some of
2009,"the lowest forms, as the infusoria and rhizopods, have remained for an"
2009,enormous period in nearly their present state. But to suppose that most
2009,of the many now existing low forms have not in the least advanced since
2009,the first dawn of life would be extremely rash; for every naturalist who
2009,has dissected some of the beings now ranked as very low in the
2009,"scale, must have been struck with their really wondrous and beautiful"
2009,organisation.
2009,
2009,"Nearly the same remarks are applicable, if we look to the different"
2009,"grades of organisation within the same great group; for instance, in the"
2009,"vertebrata, to the co-existence of mammals and fish--among mammalia, to"
2009,"the co-existence of man and the ornithorhynchus--among fishes, to the"
2009,"co-existence of the shark and the lancelet (Amphioxus), which latter"
2009,fish in the extreme simplicity of its structure approaches the
2009,invertebrate classes. But mammals and fish hardly come into competition
2009,"with each other; the advancement of the whole class of mammals, or of"
2009,"certain members in this class, to the highest grade would not lead to"
2009,their taking the place of fishes. Physiologists believe that the brain
2009,"must be bathed by warm blood to be highly active, and this requires"
2009,aerial respiration; so that warm-blooded mammals when inhabiting the
2009,water lie under a disadvantage in having to come continually to the
2009,"surface to breathe. With fishes, members of the shark family would not"
2009,"tend to supplant the lancelet; for the lancelet, as I hear from Fritz"
2009,"Muller, has as sole companion and competitor on the barren sandy shore"
2009,"of South Brazil, an anomalous annelid. The three lowest orders of"
2009,"mammals, namely, marsupials, edentata, and rodents, co-exist in South"
2009,"America in the same region with numerous monkeys, and probably interfere"
2009,"little with each other. Although organisation, on the whole, may have"
2009,"advanced and be still advancing throughout the world, yet the scale will"
2009,always present many degrees of perfection; for the high advancement of
2009,"certain whole classes, or of certain members of each class, does not at"
2009,all necessarily lead to the extinction of those groups with which
2009,"they do not enter into close competition. In some cases, as we shall"
2009,"hereafter see, lowly organised forms appear to have been preserved to"
2009,"the present day, from inhabiting confined or peculiar stations, where"
2009,"they have been subjected to less severe competition, and where their"
2009,scanty numbers have retarded the chance of favourable variations
2009,arising.
2009,
2009,"Finally, I believe that many lowly organised forms now exist throughout"
2009,"the world, from various causes. In some cases variations or individual"
2009,differences of a favourable nature may never have arisen for natural
2009,"selection to act on and accumulate. In no case, probably, has time"
2009,sufficed for the utmost possible amount of development. In some few
2009,cases there has been what we must call retrogression or organisation.
2009,But the main cause lies in the fact that under very simple conditions
2009,of life a high organisation would be of no service--possibly would be of
2009,"actual disservice, as being of a more delicate nature, and more liable"
2009,to be put out of order and injured.
2009,
2009,"Looking to the first dawn of life, when all organic beings, as we may"
2009,"believe, presented the simplest structure, how, it has been asked,"
2009,could the first step in the advancement or differentiation of parts
2009,"have arisen? Mr. Herbert Spencer would probably answer that, as soon as"
2009,simple unicellular organisms came by growth or division to be compounded
2009,"of several cells, or became attached to any supporting surface, his law"
2009,"""that homologous units of any order become differentiated in proportion"
2009,"as their relations to incident forces become different"" would come into"
2009,"action. But as we have no facts to guide us, speculation on the subject"
2009,"is almost useless. It is, however, an error to suppose that there would"
2009,"be no struggle for existence, and, consequently, no natural selection,"
2009,until many forms had been produced: variations in a single species
2009,"inhabiting an isolated station might be beneficial, and thus the whole"
2009,"mass of individuals might be modified, or two distinct forms might"
2009,"arise. But, as I remarked towards the close of the introduction, no"
2009,one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained on the
2009,"origin of species, if we make due allowance for our profound ignorance"
2009,on the mutual relations of the inhabitants of the world at the present
2009,"time, and still more so during past ages."
2009,
2009,CONVERGENCE OF CHARACTER.
2009,
2009,Mr. H.C. Watson thinks that I have overrated the importance of
2009,"divergence of character (in which, however, he apparently believes), and"
2009,"that convergence, as it may be called, has likewise played a part. If"
2009,"two species belonging to two distinct though allied genera, had both"
2009,"produced a large number of new and divergent forms, it is conceivable"
2009,that these might approach each other so closely that they would have
2009,all to be classed under the same genus; and thus the descendants of two
2009,distinct genera would converge into one. But it would in most cases
2009,be extremely rash to attribute to convergence a close and general
2009,similarity of structure in the modified descendants of widely distinct
2009,forms. The shape of a crystal is determined solely by the molecular
2009,"forces, and it is not surprising that dissimilar substances should"
2009,sometimes assume the same form; but with organic beings we should
2009,bear in mind that the form of each depends on an infinitude of complex
2009,"relations, namely on the variations which have arisen, these being due"
2009,to causes far too intricate to be followed out--on the nature of the
2009,"variations which have been preserved or selected, and this depends on"
2009,"the surrounding physical conditions, and in a still higher degree on"
2009,the surrounding organisms with which each being has come into
2009,"competition--and lastly, on inheritance (in itself a fluctuating"
2009,"element) from innumerable progenitors, all of which have had their forms"
2009,determined through equally complex relations. It is incredible that the
2009,"descendants of two organisms, which had originally differed in a marked"
2009,"manner, should ever afterwards converge so closely as to lead to a near"
2009,approach to identity throughout their whole organisation. If this had
2009,"occurred, we should meet with the same form, independently of genetic"
2009,"connection, recurring in widely separated geological formations; and the"
2009,balance of evidence is opposed to any such an admission.
2009,
2009,Mr. Watson has also objected that the continued action of natural
2009,"selection, together with divergence of character, would tend to make an"
2009,indefinite number of specific forms. As far as mere inorganic conditions
2009,"are concerned, it seems probable that a sufficient number of species"
2009,"would soon become adapted to all considerable diversities of heat,"
2009,"moisture, etc.; but I fully admit that the mutual relations of organic"
2009,beings are more important; and as the number of species in any country
2009,"goes on increasing, the organic conditions of life must become more and"
2009,more complex. Consequently there seems at first no limit to the amount
2009,"of profitable diversification of structure, and therefore no limit to"
2009,the number of species which might be produced. We do not know that even
2009,the most prolific area is fully stocked with specific forms: at the Cape
2009,"of Good Hope and in Australia, which support such an astonishing number"
2009,"of species, many European plants have become naturalised. But geology"
2009,"shows us, that from an early part of the tertiary period the number of"
2009,"species of shells, and that from the middle part of this same period,"
2009,the number of mammals has not greatly or at all increased. What then
2009,checks an indefinite increase in the number of species? The amount of
2009,life (I do not mean the number of specific forms) supported on an
2009,"area must have a limit, depending so largely as it does on physical"
2009,"conditions; therefore, if an area be inhabited by very many species,"
2009,each or nearly each species will be represented by few individuals;
2009,and such species will be liable to extermination from accidental
2009,fluctuations in the nature of the seasons or in the number of their
2009,"enemies. The process of extermination in such cases would be rapid,"
2009,whereas the production of new species must always be slow. Imagine the
2009,"extreme case of as many species as individuals in England, and the"
2009,first severe winter or very dry summer would exterminate thousands on
2009,"thousands of species. Rare species, and each species will become rare"
2009,"if the number of species in any country becomes indefinitely increased,"
2009,"will, on the principal often explained, present within a given period"
2009,"few favourable variations; consequently, the process of giving birth to"
2009,new specific forms would thus be retarded. When any species becomes
2009,"very rare, close interbreeding will help to exterminate it; authors have"
2009,thought that this comes into play in accounting for the deterioration
2009,"of the aurochs in Lithuania, of red deer in Scotland and of bears"
2009,"in Norway, etc. Lastly, and this I am inclined to think is the most"
2009,"important element, a dominant species, which has already beaten many"
2009,"competitors in its own home, will tend to spread and supplant many"
2009,others. Alph. de Candolle has shown that those species which spread
2009,"widely tend generally to spread VERY widely, consequently they will tend"
2009,"to supplant and exterminate several species in several areas, and thus"
2009,check the inordinate increase of specific forms throughout the world.
2009,"Dr. Hooker has recently shown that in the southeast corner of Australia,"
2009,"where, apparently, there are many invaders from different quarters of"
2009,"the globe, the endemic Australian species have been greatly reduced in"
2009,number. How much weight to attribute to these several considerations I
2009,will not pretend to say; but conjointly they must limit in each country
2009,the tendency to an indefinite augmentation of specific forms.
2009,
2009,SUMMARY OF CHAPTER.
2009,
2009,If under changing conditions of life organic beings present individual
2009,"differences in almost every part of their structure, and this cannot be"
2009,"disputed; if there be, owing to their geometrical rate of increase, a"
2009,"severe struggle for life at some age, season or year, and this certainly"
2009,"cannot be disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the"
2009,relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions
2009,"of life, causing an infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and"
2009,"habits, to be advantageous to them, it would be a most extraordinary"
2009,fact if no variations had ever occurred useful to each being's own
2009,"welfare, in the same manner as so many variations have occurred useful"
2009,"to man. But if variations useful to any organic being ever do occur,"
2009,assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of
2009,being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle
2009,"of inheritance, these will tend to produce offspring similarly"
2009,"characterised. This principle of preservation, or the survival of the"
2009,"fittest, I have called natural selection. It leads to the improvement"
2009,of each creature in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of
2009,"life; and consequently, in most cases, to what must be regarded as an"
2009,"advance in organisation. Nevertheless, low and simple forms will long"
2009,endure if well fitted for their simple conditions of life.
2009,
2009,"Natural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited at"
2009,"corresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young as easily as the"
2009,adult. Among many animals sexual selection will have given its aid to
2009,ordinary selection by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted
2009,males the greatest number of offspring. Sexual selection will also give
2009,characters useful to the males alone in their struggles or rivalry with
2009,other males; and these characters will be transmitted to one sex or to
2009,"both sexes, according to the form of inheritance which prevails."
2009,
2009,Whether natural selection has really thus acted in adapting the various
2009,"forms of life to their several conditions and stations, must be judged"
2009,by the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following
2009,chapters. But we have already seen how it entails extinction; and how
2009,"largely extinction has acted in the world's history, geology plainly"
2009,"declares. Natural selection, also, leads to divergence of character; for"
2009,"the more organic beings diverge in structure, habits and constitution,"
2009,"by so much the more can a large number be supported on the area, of"
2009,"which we see proof by looking to the inhabitants of any small spot, and"
2009,"to the productions naturalised in foreign lands. Therefore, during"
2009,"the modification of the descendants of any one species, and during"
2009,"the incessant struggle of all species to increase in numbers, the more"
2009,"diversified the descendants become, the better will be their chance"
2009,of success in the battle for life. Thus the small differences
2009,"distinguishing varieties of the same species, steadily tend to increase,"
2009,till they equal the greater differences between species of the same
2009,"genus, or even of distinct genera."
2009,
2009,"We have seen that it is the common, the widely diffused, and widely"
2009,"ranging species, belonging to the larger genera within each class, which"
2009,vary most; and these tend to transmit to their modified offspring
2009,that superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries.
2009,"Natural selection, as has just been remarked, leads to divergence of"
2009,character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate
2009,"forms of life. On these principles, the nature of the affinities, and"
2009,the generally well defined distinctions between the innumerable organic
2009,"beings in each class throughout the world, may be explained. It is a"
2009,truly wonderful fact--the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from
2009,familiarity--that all animals and all plants throughout all time and
2009,"space should be related to each other in groups, subordinate to groups,"
2009,"in the manner which we everywhere behold--namely, varieties of the same"
2009,"species most closely related, species of the same genus less closely and"
2009,"unequally related, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct"
2009,"genera much less closely related, and genera related in different"
2009,"degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and"
2009,classes. The several subordinate groups in any class cannot be ranked
2009,"in a single file, but seem clustered round points, and these round"
2009,"other points, and so on in almost endless cycles. If species had been"
2009,"independently created, no explanation would have been possible of this"
2009,kind of classification; but it is explained through inheritance and the
2009,"complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and divergence"
2009,"of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram."
2009,
2009,The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been
2009,represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the
2009,truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and
2009,those produced during former years may represent the long succession
2009,of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs
2009,"have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the"
2009,"surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups"
2009,of species have at all times overmastered other species in the great
2009,"battle for life. The limbs divided into great branches, and these into"
2009,"lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was"
2009,"young, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present"
2009,buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all
2009,extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the many
2009,"twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three,"
2009,"now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear the other branches;"
2009,"so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods,"
2009,very few have left living and modified descendants. From the first
2009,"growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off;"
2009,and these fallen branches of various sizes may represent those whole
2009,"orders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives,"
2009,and which are known to us only in a fossil state. As we here and there
2009,"see a thin, straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree,"
2009,and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its
2009,"summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the Ornithorhynchus or"
2009,"Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its affinities two"
2009,"large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal"
2009,competition by having inhabited a protected station. As buds give rise
2009,"by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop"
2009,"on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has"
2009,"been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken"
2009,"branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its"
2009,ever-branching and beautiful ramifications.

2009," correlations--Multiple, rudimentary, and lowly organised structures"

2009, manner--Reversions to long-lost characters--Summary.
2009,
2009,
2009,I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations--so common and
2009,"multiform with organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser"
2009,"degree with those under nature--were due to chance. This, of course is"
2009,"a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly"
2009,our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation. Some authors
2009,believe it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to
2009,"produce individual differences, or slight deviations of structure, as"
2009,to make the child like its parents. But the fact of variations and
2009,monstrosities occurring much more frequently under domestication than
2009,"under nature, and the greater variability of species having wide ranges"
2009,"than of those with restricted ranges, lead to the conclusion that"
2009,variability is generally related to the conditions of life to which each
2009,species has been exposed during several successive generations. In the
2009,first chapter I attempted to show that changed conditions act in two
2009,"ways, directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone, and"
2009,indirectly through the reproductive system. In all cases there are two
2009,"factors, the nature of the organism, which is much the most important of"
2009,"the two, and the nature of the conditions. The direct action of changed"
2009,conditions leads to definite or indefinite results. In the latter case
2009,"the organisation seems to become plastic, and we have much fluctuating"
2009,variability. In the former case the nature of the organism is such that
2009,"it yields readily, when subjected to certain conditions, and all, or"
2009,"nearly all, the individuals become modified in the same way."
2009,
2009,"It is very difficult to decide how far changed conditions, such as of"
2009,"climate, food, etc., have acted in a definite manner. There is reason"
2009,to believe that in the course of time the effects have been greater than
2009,can be proved by clear evidence. But we may safely conclude that the
2009,"innumerable complex co-adaptations of structure, which we see throughout"
2009,"nature between various organic beings, cannot be attributed simply to"
2009,such action. In the following cases the conditions seem to have produced
2009,some slight definite effect: E. Forbes asserts that shells at their
2009,"southern limit, and when living in shallow water, are more brightly"
2009,coloured than those of the same species from further north or from a
2009,greater depth; but this certainly does not always hold good. Mr. Gould
2009,believes that birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under
2009,"a clear atmosphere, than when living near the coast or on islands; and"
2009,Wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea affects the colours
2009,"of insects. Moquin-Tandon gives a list of plants which, when growing"
2009,"near the sea-shore, have their leaves in some degree fleshy, though not"
2009,elsewhere fleshy. These slightly varying organisms are interesting in
2009,as far as they present characters analogous to those possessed by the
2009,species which are confined to similar conditions.
2009,
2009,"When a variation is of the slightest use to any being, we cannot tell"
2009,"how much to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection,"
2009,"and how much to the definite action of the conditions of life. Thus, it"
2009,is well known to furriers that animals of the same species have thicker
2009,and better fur the further north they live; but who can tell how much of
2009,this difference may be due to the warmest-clad individuals having been
2009,"favoured and preserved during many generations, and how much to the"
2009,action of the severe climate? For it would appear that climate has some
2009,direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds.
2009,
2009,Instances could be given of similar varieties being produced from the
2009,same species under external conditions of life as different as can well
2009,"be conceived; and, on the other hand, of dissimilar varieties being"
2009,"produced under apparently the same external conditions. Again,"
2009,"innumerable instances are known to every naturalist, of species keeping"
2009,"true, or not varying at all, although living under the most opposite"
2009,climates. Such considerations as these incline me to lay less weight on
2009,"the direct action of the surrounding conditions, than on a tendency to"
2009,"vary, due to causes of which we are quite ignorant."
2009,
2009,"In one sense the conditions of life may be said, not only to cause"
2009,"variability, either directly or indirectly, but likewise to include"
2009,"natural selection, for the conditions determine whether this or that"
2009,"variety shall survive. But when man is the selecting agent, we clearly"
2009,see that the two elements of change are distinct; variability is in
2009,"some manner excited, but it is the will of man which accumulates the"
2009,variations in certain direction; and it is this latter agency which
2009,answers to the survival of the fittest under nature.
2009,
2009,"EFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS, AS CONTROLLED BY"
2009,NATURAL SELECTION.
2009,
2009,"From the facts alluded to in the first chapter, I think there can be"
2009,no doubt that use in our domestic animals has strengthened and enlarged
2009,"certain parts, and disuse diminished them; and that such modifications"
2009,are inherited. Under free nature we have no standard of comparison by
2009,"which to judge of the effects of long-continued use or disuse, for we"
2009,know not the parent-forms; but many animals possess structures which
2009,can be best explained by the effects of disuse. As Professor Owen has
2009,"remarked, there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot"
2009,fly; yet there are several in this state. The logger-headed duck of
2009,"South America can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its"
2009,wings in nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck: it is
2009,"a remarkable fact that the young birds, according to Mr. Cunningham, can"
2009,"fly, while the adults have lost this power. As the larger ground-feeding"
2009,"birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, it is probable that"
2009,"the nearly wingless condition of several birds, now inhabiting or which"
2009,"lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beasts of prey,"
2009,"has been caused by disuse. The ostrich indeed inhabits continents, and"
2009,"is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight, but it"
2009,"can defend itself, by kicking its enemies, as efficiently as many"
2009,quadrupeds. We may believe that the progenitor of the ostrich genus had
2009,"habits like those of the bustard, and that, as the size and weight of"
2009,"its body were increased during successive generations, its legs were"
2009,"used more and its wings less, until they became incapable of flight."
2009,
2009,Kirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the anterior
2009,"tarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are often broken off;"
2009,"he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and not one had"
2009,even a relic left. In the Onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually
2009,lost that the insect has been described as not having them. In some
2009,"other genera they are present, but in a rudimentary condition. In the"
2009,"Ateuchus or sacred beetle of the Egyptians, they are totally deficient."
2009,The evidence that accidental mutilations can be inherited is at present
2009,not decisive; but the remarkable cases observed by Brown-Sequard in
2009,"guinea-pigs, of the inherited effects of operations, should make us"
2009,"cautious in denying this tendency. Hence, it will perhaps be safest to"
2009,"look at the entire absence of the anterior tarsi in Ateuchus, and their"
2009,"rudimentary condition in some other genera, not as cases of inherited"
2009,"mutilations, but as due to the effects of long-continued disuse; for"
2009,"as many dung-feeding beetles are generally found with their tarsi lost,"
2009,this must happen early in life; therefore the tarsi cannot be of much
2009,importance or be much used by these insects.
2009,
2009,In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of
2009,"structure which are wholly, or mainly due to natural selection. Mr."
2009,"Wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that  beetles, out of"
2009,"the  species (but more are now known) inhabiting Madeira, are so far"
2009,"deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that, of the twenty-nine"
2009,"endemic genera, no less than twenty-three have all their species in"
2009,"this condition! Several facts, namely, that beetles in many parts of the"
2009,world are very frequently blown to sea and perish; that the beetles in
2009,"Madeira, as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much concealed, until the"
2009,wind lulls and the sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles
2009,is larger on the exposed Desertas than in Madeira itself; and especially
2009,"the extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston, that"
2009,"certain large groups of beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, which"
2009,"absolutely require the use of their wings, are here almost entirely"
2009,absent. These several considerations make me believe that the wingless
2009,condition of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of
2009,"natural selection, combined probably with disuse. For during many"
2009,"successive generations each individual beetle which flew least, either"
2009,from its wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or
2009,"from indolent habit, will have had the best chance of surviving from not"
2009,"being blown out to sea; and, on the other hand, those beetles which most"
2009,"readily took to flight would oftenest have been blown to sea, and thus"
2009,destroyed.
2009,
2009,"The insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as"
2009,"certain flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use"
2009,"their wings to gain their subsistence, have, as Mr. Wollaston suspects,"
2009,"their wings not at all reduced, but even enlarged. This is quite"
2009,compatible with the action of natural selection. For when a new insect
2009,"first arrived on the island, the tendency of natural selection to"
2009,"enlarge or to reduce the wings, would depend on whether a greater number"
2009,"of individuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds, or"
2009,by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying. As with mariners
2009,"shipwrecked near a coast, it would have been better for the good"
2009,"swimmers if they had been able to swim still further, whereas it would"
2009,have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim
2009,at all and had stuck to the wreck.
2009,
2009,"The eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size,"
2009,and in some cases are quite covered by skin and fur. This state of the
2009,"eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided"
2009,"perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the"
2009,"tuco-tuco, or Ctenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than the"
2009,"mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that"
2009,they were frequently blind. One which I kept alive was certainly in
2009,"this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been"
2009,inflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of
2009,"the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not"
2009,"necessary to animals having subterranean habits, a reduction in their"
2009,"size, with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them,"
2009,"might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would"
2009,aid the effects of disuse.
2009,
2009,"It is well known that several animals, belonging to the most different"
2009,"classes, which inhabit the caves of Carniola and Kentucky, are blind. In"
2009,"some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye is"
2009,"gone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope with"
2009,"its glasses has been lost. As it is difficult to imagine that eyes,"
2009,"though useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in"
2009,"darkness, their loss may be attributed to disuse. In one of the blind"
2009,"animals, namely, the cave-rat (Neotoma), two of which were captured by"
2009,Professor Silliman at above half a mile distance from the mouth of
2009,"the cave, and therefore not in the profoundest depths, the eyes were"
2009,"lustrous and of large size; and these animals, as I am informed by"
2009,"Professor Silliman, after having been exposed for about a month to a"
2009,"graduated light, acquired a dim perception of objects."
2009,
2009,It is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep
2009,"limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that, in accordance"
2009,with the old view of the blind animals having been separately created
2009,"for the American and European caverns, very close similarity in their"
2009,organisation and affinities might have been expected. This is certainly
2009,not the case if we look at the two whole faunas; with respect to the
2009,"insects alone, Schiodte has remarked: ""We are accordingly prevented"
2009,from considering the entire phenomenon in any other light than something
2009,"purely local, and the similarity which is exhibited in a few forms"
2009,"between the Mammoth Cave (in Kentucky) and the caves in Carniola,"
2009,otherwise than as a very plain expression of that analogy which subsists
2009,"generally between the fauna of Europe and of North America."" On my view"
2009,"we must suppose that American animals, having in most cases ordinary"
2009,"powers of vision, slowly migrated by successive generations from the"
2009,"outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves,"
2009,as did European animals into the caves of Europe. We have some evidence
2009,"of this gradation of habit; for, as Schiodte remarks: ""We accordingly"
2009,look upon the subterranean faunas as small ramifications which have
2009,penetrated into the earth from the geographically limited faunas of the
2009,"adjacent tracts, and which, as they extended themselves into darkness,"
2009,have been accommodated to surrounding circumstances. Animals not
2009,"far remote from ordinary forms, prepare the transition from light to"
2009,"darkness. Next follow those that are constructed for twilight; and, last"
2009,"of all, those destined for total darkness, and whose formation is quite"
2009,"peculiar."" These remarks of Schiodte's it should be understood, apply"
2009,"not to the same, but to distinct species. By the time that an animal had"
2009,"reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse"
2009,"will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and"
2009,"natural selection will often have effected other changes, such as an"
2009,"increase in the length of the antennae or palpi, as a compensation for"
2009,"blindness. Notwithstanding such modifications, we might expect still to"
2009,"see in the cave-animals of America, affinities to the other inhabitants"
2009,"of that continent, and in those of Europe to the inhabitants of the"
2009,European continent. And this is the case with some of the American
2009,"cave-animals, as I hear from Professor Dana; and some of the European"
2009,cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding
2009,country. It would be difficult to give any rational explanation of the
2009,affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other inhabitants of the
2009,two continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation. That
2009,several of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New Worlds should
2009,"be closely related, we might expect from the well-known relationship"
2009,of most of their other productions. As a blind species of Bathyscia is
2009,"found in abundance on shady rocks far from caves, the loss of vision in"
2009,the cave species of this one genus has probably had no relation to its
2009,dark habitation; for it is natural that an insect already deprived of
2009,vision should readily become adapted to dark caverns. Another blind
2009,"genus (Anophthalmus) offers this remarkable peculiarity, that the"
2009,"species, as Mr. Murray observes, have not as yet been found anywhere"
2009,except in caves; yet those which inhabit the several caves of Europe and
2009,America are distinct; but it is possible that the progenitors of these
2009,"several species, while they were furnished with eyes, may formerly have"
2009,"ranged over both continents, and then have become extinct, excepting in"
2009,their present secluded abodes. Far from feeling surprise that some of
2009,"the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked in"
2009,"regard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with the"
2009,"blind Proteus, with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only"
2009,"surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved,"
2009,owing to the less severe competition to which the scanty inhabitants of
2009,these dark abodes will have been exposed.
2009,
2009,ACCLIMATISATION.
2009,
2009,"Habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering, in the"
2009,"time of sleep, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate,"
2009,"etc., and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation. As it"
2009,is extremely common for distinct species belonging to the same genus to
2009,"inhabit hot and cold countries, if it be true that all the species of"
2009,"the same genus are descended from a single parent-form, acclimatisation"
2009,must be readily effected during a long course of descent. It is
2009,notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home:
2009,species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot endure a
2009,"tropical climate, or conversely. So again, many succulent plants cannot"
2009,endure a damp climate. But the degree of adaptation of species to the
2009,climates under which they live is often overrated. We may infer this
2009,from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant
2009,"will endure our climate, and from the number of plants and animals"
2009,brought from different countries which are here perfectly healthy. We
2009,have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are closely
2009,limited in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite
2009,"as much as, or more than, by adaptation to particular climates. But"
2009,"whether or not this adaptation is in most cases very close, we have"
2009,"evidence with some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain extent,"
2009,"naturally habituated to different temperatures; that is, they become"
2009,"acclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed"
2009,collected by Dr. Hooker from the same species growing at different
2009,"heights on the Himalayas, were found to possess in this country"
2009,different constitutional powers of resisting cold. Mr. Thwaites informs
2009,me that he has observed similar facts in Ceylon; analogous observations
2009,have been made by Mr. H.C. Watson on European species of plants brought
2009,from the Azores to England; and I could give other cases. In regard to
2009,"animals, several authentic instances could be adduced of species having"
2009,"largely extended, within historical times, their range from warmer to"
2009,"colder latitudes, and conversely; but we do not positively know that"
2009,"these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate, though in"
2009,all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we know that
2009,"they have subsequently become specially acclimatised to their new homes,"
2009,so as to be better fitted for them than they were at first.
2009,
2009,As we may infer that our domestic animals were originally chosen by
2009,"uncivilised man because they were useful, and because they bred readily"
2009,"under confinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable"
2009,"of far-extended transportation, the common and extraordinary capacity"
2009,in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different
2009,"climates, but of being perfectly fertile (a far severer test) under"
2009,"them, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other"
2009,animals now in a state of nature could easily be brought to bear widely
2009,"different climates. We must not, however, push the foregoing argument"
2009,"too far, on account of the probable origin of some of our domestic"
2009,"animals from several wild stocks: the blood, for instance, of a tropical"
2009,and arctic wolf may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds. The rat
2009,"and mouse cannot be considered as domestic animals, but they have been"
2009,"transported by man to many parts of the world, and now have a far wider"
2009,range than any other rodent; for they live under the cold climate of
2009,"Faroe in the north and of the Falklands in the south, and on many an"
2009,island in the torrid zones. Hence adaptation to any special climate may
2009,be looked at as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility
2009,"of constitution, common to most animals. On this view, the capacity of"
2009,enduring the most different climates by man himself and by his domestic
2009,"animals, and the fact of the extinct elephant and rhinoceros having"
2009,"formerly endured a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now"
2009,"all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked"
2009,"at as anomalies, but as examples of a very common flexibility of"
2009,"constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances, into action."
2009,
2009,How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is
2009,"due to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties"
2009,"having different innate constitutions, and how much to both means"
2009,"combined, is an obscure question. That habit or custom has some"
2009,"influence, I must believe, both from analogy and from the incessant"
2009,"advice given in agricultural works, even in the ancient Encyclopaedias"
2009,"of China, to be very cautious in transporting animals from one district"
2009,to another. And as it is not likely that man should have succeeded in
2009,selecting so many breeds and sub-breeds with constitutions specially
2009,"fitted for their own districts, the result must, I think, be due to"
2009,"habit. On the other hand, natural selection would inevitably tend to"
2009,preserve those individuals which were born with constitutions best
2009,adapted to any country which they inhabited. In treatises on many kinds
2009,"of cultivated plants, certain varieties are said to withstand certain"
2009,climates better than others; this is strikingly shown in works on
2009,"fruit-trees published in the United States, in which certain varieties"
2009,are habitually recommended for the northern and others for the southern
2009,"states; and as most of these varieties are of recent origin, they cannot"
2009,owe their constitutional differences to habit. The case of the Jerusalem
2009,"artichoke, which is never propagated in England by seed, and of which,"
2009,"consequently, new varieties have not been produced, has even been"
2009,"advanced, as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected, for it"
2009,"is now as tender as ever it was! The case, also, of the kidney-bean has"
2009,"been often cited for a similar purpose, and with much greater weight;"
2009,"but until some one will sow, during a score of generations, his"
2009,kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by
2009,"frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care"
2009,"to prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these"
2009,"seedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to"
2009,have been even tried. Nor let it be supposed that differences in the
2009,"constitution of seedling kidney-beans never appear, for an account has"
2009,been published how much more hardy some seedlings are than others; and
2009,of this fact I have myself observed striking instances.
2009,
2009,"On the whole, we may conclude that habit, or use and disuse, have,"
2009,"in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the"
2009,constitution and structure; but that the effects have often been largely
2009,"combined with, and sometimes overmastered by, the natural selection of"
2009,innate variations.
2009,
2009,CORRELATED VARIATION.
2009,
2009,I mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied
2009,"together, during its growth and development, that when slight variations"
2009,"in any one part occur and are accumulated through natural selection,"
2009,"other parts become modified. This is a very important subject, most"
2009,"imperfectly understood, and no doubt wholly different classes of facts"
2009,may be here easily confounded together. We shall presently see that
2009,simple inheritance often gives the false appearance of correlation. One
2009,"of the most obvious real cases is, that variations of structure arising"
2009,in the young or larvae naturally tend to affect the structure of the
2009,"mature animal. The several parts which are homologous, and which, at"
2009,"an early embryonic period, are identical in structure, and which are"
2009,"necessarily exposed to similar conditions, seem eminently liable to vary"
2009,in a like manner: we see this in the right and left sides of the body
2009,"varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and even in the"
2009,"jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed by some"
2009,"anatomists to be homologous with the limbs. These tendencies, I do not"
2009,"doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection:"
2009,thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side; and
2009,"if this had been of any great use to the breed, it might probably have"
2009,been rendered permanent by natural selection.
2009,
2009,"Homologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to cohere;"
2009,this is often seen in monstrous plants: and nothing is more common than
2009,"the union of homologous parts in normal structures, as in the union of"
2009,the petals into a tube. Hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining
2009,soft parts; it is believed by some authors that with birds the diversity
2009,in the shape of the pelvis causes the remarkable diversity in the shape
2009,of the kidneys. Others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the human
2009,mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child. In
2009,"snakes, according to Schlegel, the shape of the body and the manner"
2009,of swallowing determine the position and form of several of the most
2009,important viscera.
2009,
2009,The nature of the bond is frequently quite obscure. M. Is. Geoffroy St.
2009,"Hilaire has forcibly remarked that certain malconformations frequently,"
2009,"and that others rarely, coexist without our being able to assign any"
2009,reason. What can be more singular than the relation in cats between
2009,"complete whiteness and blue eyes with deafness, or between the"
2009,"tortoise-shell colour and the female sex; or in pigeons, between their"
2009,"feathered feet and skin betwixt the outer toes, or between the presence"
2009,"of more or less down on the young pigeon when first hatched, with the"
2009,"future colour of its plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair"
2009,"and the teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here no doubt homology"
2009,"comes into play? With respect to this latter case of correlation, I"
2009,think it can hardly be accidental that the two orders of mammals which
2009,"are most abnormal in their dermal covering, viz., Cetacea (whales) and"
2009,"Edentata (armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters, etc.), are likewise on the"
2009,"whole the most abnormal in their teeth, but there are so many exceptions"
2009,"to this rule, as Mr. Mivart has remarked, that it has little value."
2009,
2009,I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of
2009,"correlation and variation, independently of utility, and therefore of"
2009,"natural selection, than that of the difference between the outer and"
2009,inner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants. Everyone is
2009,"familiar with the difference between the ray and central florets of, for"
2009,"instance, the daisy, and this difference is often accompanied with the"
2009,partial or complete abortion of the reproductive organs. But in some
2009,of these plants the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture. These
2009,differences have sometimes been attributed to the pressure of the
2009,"involucra on the florets, or to their mutual pressure, and the shape of"
2009,the seeds in the ray-florets of some Compositae countenances this idea;
2009,"but with the Umbelliferae it is by no means, as Dr. Hooker informs me,"
2009,the species with the densest heads which most frequently differ in their
2009,inner and outer flowers. It might have been thought that the development
2009,"of the ray-petals, by drawing nourishment from the reproductive organs"
2009,"causes their abortion; but this can hardly be the sole case, for in some"
2009,"Compositae the seeds of the outer and inner florets differ, without any"
2009,difference in the corolla. Possibly these several differences may be
2009,connected with the different flow of nutriment towards the central and
2009,"external flowers. We know, at least, that with irregular flowers those"
2009,"nearest to the axis are most subject to peloria, that is to become"
2009,"abnormally symmetrical. I may add, as an instance of this fact, and as"
2009,"a striking case of correlation, that in many pelargoniums the two upper"
2009,petals in the central flower of the truss often lose their patches
2009,"of darker colour; and when this occurs, the adherent nectary is quite"
2009,"aborted, the central flower thus becoming peloric or regular. When the"
2009,"colour is absent from only one of the two upper petals, the nectary is"
2009,not quite aborted but is much shortened.
2009,
2009,"With respect to the development of the corolla, Sprengel's idea that"
2009,"the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly"
2009,"advantageous, or necessary for the fertilisation of these plants, is"
2009,"highly probable; and if so, natural selection may have come into"
2009,"play. But with respect to the seeds, it seems impossible that their"
2009,"differences in shape, which are not always correlated with any"
2009,"difference in the corolla, can be in any way beneficial; yet in the"
2009,Umbelliferae these differences are of such apparent importance--the
2009,seeds being sometimes orthospermous in the exterior flowers and
2009,coelospermous in the central flowers--that the elder De Candolle founded
2009,his main divisions in the order on such characters. Hence modifications
2009,"of structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due"
2009,"to the laws of variation and correlation, without being, as far as we"
2009,"can judge, of the slightest service to the species."
2009,
2009,We may often falsely attribute to correlated variation structures which
2009,"are common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply"
2009,due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through
2009,"natural selection some one modification in structure, and, after"
2009,"thousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and"
2009,"these two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of"
2009,"descendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be in"
2009,some necessary manner correlated. Some other correlations are apparently
2009,due to the manner in which natural selection can alone act. For
2009,"instance, Alph. De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never"
2009,found in fruits which do not open; I should explain this rule by
2009,the impossibility of seeds gradually becoming winged through natural
2009,"selection, unless the capsules were open; for in this case alone could"
2009,"the seeds, which were a little better adapted to be wafted by the wind,"
2009,gain an advantage over others less well fitted for wide dispersal.
2009,
2009,COMPENSATION AND ECONOMY OF GROWTH.
2009,
2009,"The elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same time, their"
2009,"law of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as Goethe expressed"
2009,"it, ""in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to economise on"
2009,"the other side."" I think this holds true to a certain extent with our"
2009,domestic productions: if nourishment flows to one part or organ in
2009,"excess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another part; thus it is"
2009,difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily. The same
2009,varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage
2009,and a copious supply of oil-bearing seeds. When the seeds in our fruits
2009,"become atrophied, the fruit itself gains largely in size and quality."
2009,"In our poultry, a large tuft of feathers on the head is generally"
2009,"accompanied by a diminished comb, and a large beard by diminished"
2009,wattles. With species in a state of nature it can hardly be maintained
2009,"that the law is of universal application; but many good observers, more"
2009,"especially botanists, believe in its truth. I will not, however, here"
2009,"give any instances, for I see hardly any way of distinguishing between"
2009,"the effects, on the one hand, of a part being largely developed through"
2009,natural selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by the
2009,"same process or by disuse, and, on the other hand, the actual withdrawal"
2009,of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another and
2009,adjoining part.
2009,
2009,"I suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been"
2009,"advanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more"
2009,"general principle, namely, that natural selection is continually"
2009,trying to economise in every part of the organisation. If under changed
2009,"conditions of life a structure, before useful, becomes less useful, its"
2009,"diminution will be favoured, for it will profit the individual not to"
2009,have its nutriment wasted in building up a useless structure. I can
2009,thus only understand a fact with which I was much struck when examining
2009,"cirripedes, and of which many other instances could be given: namely,"
2009,that when a cirripede is parasitic within another cirripede and is thus
2009,"protected, it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace."
2009,"This is the case with the male Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner"
2009,with the Proteolepas: for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists
2009,of the three highly important anterior segments of the head enormously
2009,"developed, and furnished with great nerves and muscles; but in the"
2009,"parasitic and protected Proteolepas, the whole anterior part of the"
2009,head is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the
2009,"prehensile antennae. Now the saving of a large and complex structure,"
2009,"when rendered superfluous, would be a decided advantage to each"
2009,successive individual of the species; for in the struggle for life
2009,"to which every animal is exposed, each would have a better chance of"
2009,"supporting itself, by less nutriment being wasted."
2009,
2009,"Thus, as I believe, natural selection will tend in the long run to"
2009,"reduce any part of the organisation, as soon as it becomes, through"
2009,"changed habits, superfluous, without by any means causing some other"
2009,"part to be largely developed in a corresponding degree. And conversely,"
2009,that natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing
2009,an organ without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of
2009,some adjoining part.
2009,
2009,"MULTIPLE, RUDIMENTARY, AND LOWLY-ORGANISED STRUCTURES ARE VARIABLE."
2009,
2009,"It seems to be a rule, as remarked by Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, both"
2009,"with varieties and species, that when any part or organ is repeated"
2009,"many times in the same individual (as the vertebrae in snakes, and the"
2009,stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable; whereas the
2009,"number of the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser numbers,"
2009,"is constant. The same author as well as some botanists, have further"
2009,remarked that multiple parts are extremely liable to vary in structure.
2009,"As ""vegetative repetition,"" to use Professor Owen's expression, is"
2009,a sign of low organisation; the foregoing statements accord with the
2009,"common opinion of naturalists, that beings which stand low in the scale"
2009,of nature are more variable than those which are higher. I presume that
2009,lowness here means that the several parts of the organisation have been
2009,but little specialised for particular functions; and as long as the same
2009,"part has to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why it"
2009,"should remain variable, that is, why natural selection should not have"
2009,preserved or rejected each little deviation of form so carefully as when
2009,the part has to serve for some one special purpose. In the same way that
2009,a knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape;
2009,whilst a tool for some particular purpose must be of some particular
2009,"shape. Natural selection, it should never be forgotten, can act solely"
2009,through and for the advantage of each being.
2009,
2009,"Rudimentary parts, as is generally admitted, are apt to be highly"
2009,variable. We shall have to recur to this subject; and I will here only
2009,"add that their variability seems to result from their uselessness,"
2009,and consequently from natural selection having had no power to check
2009,deviations in their structure.
2009,
2009,"A PART DEVELOPED IN ANY SPECIES IN AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OR MANNER,"
2009,"IN COMPARISON WITH THE SAME PART IN ALLIED SPECIES, TENDS TO BE HIGHLY"
2009,VARIABLE.
2009,
2009,Several years ago I was much struck by a remark to the above effect made
2009,"by Mr. Waterhouse. Professor Owen, also, seems to have come to a nearly"
2009,similar conclusion. It is hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the
2009,truth of the above proposition without giving the long array of facts
2009,"which I have collected, and which cannot possibly be here introduced. I"
2009,can only state my conviction that it is a rule of high generality. I
2009,"am aware of several causes of error, but I hope that I have made due"
2009,allowances for them. It should be understood that the rule by no means
2009,"applies to any part, however unusually developed, unless it be unusually"
2009,developed in one species or in a few species in comparison with the same
2009,"part in many closely allied species. Thus, the wing of the bat is a most"
2009,abnormal structure in the class of mammals; but the rule would not apply
2009,"here, because the whole group of bats possesses wings; it would apply"
2009,only if some one species had wings developed in a remarkable manner in
2009,comparison with the other species of the same genus. The rule applies
2009,"very strongly in the case of secondary sexual characters, when displayed"
2009,"in any unusual manner. The term, secondary sexual characters, used by"
2009,"Hunter, relates to characters which are attached to one sex, but are"
2009,not directly connected with the act of reproduction. The rule applies
2009,"to males and females; but more rarely to females, as they seldom offer"
2009,remarkable secondary sexual characters. The rule being so plainly
2009,"applicable in the case of secondary sexual characters, may be due to the"
2009,"great variability of these characters, whether or not displayed in any"
2009,unusual manner--of which fact I think there can be little doubt. But
2009,that our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly
2009,shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes; I particularly attended
2009,"to Mr. Waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating this order, and I am"
2009,"fully convinced that the rule almost always holds good. I shall, in a"
2009,"future work, give a list of all the more remarkable cases. I will here"
2009,"give only one, as it illustrates the rule in its largest application."
2009,"The opercular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in"
2009,"every sense of the word, very important structures, and they differ"
2009,extremely little even in distinct genera; but in the several species
2009,"of one genus, Pyrgoma, these valves present a marvellous amount of"
2009,diversification; the homologous valves in the different species being
2009,sometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the
2009,individuals of the same species is so great that it is no exaggeration
2009,to state that the varieties of the same species differ more from each
2009,"other in the characters derived from these important organs, than do the"
2009,species belonging to other distinct genera.
2009,
2009,"As with birds the individuals of the same species, inhabiting the same"
2009,"country, vary extremely little, I have particularly attended to them;"
2009,and the rule certainly seems to hold good in this class. I cannot make
2009,"out that it applies to plants, and this would have seriously shaken my"
2009,"belief in its truth, had not the great variability in plants made it"
2009,particularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of variability.
2009,
2009,When we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner
2009,"in a species, the fair presumption is that it is of high importance"
2009,to that species: nevertheless it is in this case eminently liable to
2009,variation. Why should this be so? On the view that each species has been
2009,"independently created, with all its parts as we now see them, I can see"
2009,no explanation. But on the view that groups of species are descended
2009,"from some other species, and have been modified through natural"
2009,"selection, I think we can obtain some light. First let me make some"
2009,"preliminary remarks. If, in our domestic animals, any part or the"
2009,"whole animal be neglected, and no selection be applied, that part (for"
2009,"instance, the comb in the Dorking fowl) or the whole breed will cease to"
2009,have a uniform character: and the breed may be said to be degenerating.
2009,"In rudimentary organs, and in those which have been but little"
2009,"specialised for any particular purpose, and perhaps in polymorphic"
2009,"groups, we see a nearly parallel case; for in such cases natural"
2009,"selection either has not or cannot come into full play, and thus the"
2009,organisation is left in a fluctuating condition. But what here more
2009,"particularly concerns us is, that those points in our domestic animals,"
2009,which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by continued
2009,"selection, are also eminently liable to variation. Look at the"
2009,individuals of the same breed of the pigeon; and see what a prodigious
2009,"amount of difference there is in the beak of tumblers, in the beak and"
2009,"wattle of carriers, in the carriage and tail of fantails, etc., these"
2009,being the points now mainly attended to by English fanciers. Even in the
2009,"same sub-breed, as in that of the short-faced tumbler, it is notoriously"
2009,"difficult to breed nearly perfect birds, many departing widely from the"
2009,standard. There may truly be said to be a constant struggle going on
2009,"between, on the one hand, the tendency to reversion to a less perfect"
2009,"state, as well as an innate tendency to new variations, and, on the"
2009,"other hand, the power of steady selection to keep the breed true. In"
2009,"the long run selection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so"
2009,completely as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler pigeon from
2009,a good short-faced strain. But as long as selection is rapidly going
2009,"on, much variability in the parts undergoing modification may always be"
2009,expected.
2009,
2009,Now let us turn to nature. When a part has been developed in an
2009,"extraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species"
2009,"of the same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone an"
2009,extraordinary amount of modification since the period when the several
2009,species branched off from the common progenitor of the genus. This
2009,"period will seldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species rarely"
2009,endure for more than one geological period. An extraordinary amount of
2009,modification implies an unusually large and long-continued amount of
2009,"variability, which has continually been accumulated by natural"
2009,selection for the benefit of the species. But as the variability of
2009,the extraordinarily developed part or organ has been so great and
2009,"long-continued within a period not excessively remote, we might, as a"
2009,"general rule, still expect to find more variability in such parts than"
2009,in other parts of the organisation which have remained for a much longer
2009,"period nearly constant. And this, I am convinced, is the case. That the"
2009,"struggle between natural selection on the one hand, and the tendency to"
2009,"reversion and variability on the other hand, will in the course of"
2009,time cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs may be made
2009,"constant, I see no reason to doubt. Hence, when an organ, however"
2009,"abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in approximately the same"
2009,"condition to many modified descendants, as in the case of the wing of"
2009,"the bat, it must have existed, according to our theory, for an immense"
2009,period in nearly the same state; and thus it has come not to be more
2009,variable than any other structure. It is only in those cases in which
2009,the modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great
2009,"that we ought to find the GENERATIVE VARIABILITY, as it may be called,"
2009,still present in a high degree. For in this case the variability
2009,will seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the
2009,"individuals varying in the required manner and degree, and by the"
2009,continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less
2009,modified condition.
2009,
2009,SPECIFIC CHARACTERS MORE VARIABLE THAN GENERIC CHARACTERS.
2009,
2009,The principle discussed under the last heading may be applied to our
2009,present subject. It is notorious that specific characters are more
2009,variable than generic. To explain by a simple example what is meant: if
2009,in a large genus of plants some species had blue flowers and some had
2009,"red, the colour would be only a specific character, and no one would be"
2009,"surprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or conversely;"
2009,"but if all the species had blue flowers, the colour would become"
2009,"a generic character, and its variation would be a more unusual"
2009,circumstance. I have chosen this example because the explanation which
2009,"most naturalists would advance is not here applicable, namely, that"
2009,"specific characters are more variable than generic, because they are"
2009,taken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly
2009,"used for classing genera. I believe this explanation is partly, yet only"
2009,"indirectly, true; I shall, however, have to return to this point in"
2009,the chapter on Classification. It would be almost superfluous to adduce
2009,"evidence in support of the statement, that ordinary specific characters"
2009,are more variable than generic; but with respect to important
2009,"characters, I have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that"
2009,"when an author remarks with surprise that some important organ or part,"
2009,"which is generally very constant throughout a large group of species,"
2009,"DIFFERS considerably in closely-allied species, it is often VARIABLE"
2009,in the individuals of the same species. And this fact shows that a
2009,"character, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value"
2009,"and becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its"
2009,physiological importance may remain the same. Something of the same kind
2009,applies to monstrosities: at least Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire apparently
2009,"entertains no doubt, that the more an organ normally differs in the"
2009,"different species of the same group, the more subject it is to anomalies"
2009,in the individuals.
2009,
2009,"On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,"
2009,"why should that part of the structure, which differs from the same"
2009,"part in other independently created species of the same genus, be"
2009,more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several
2009,species? I do not see that any explanation can be given. But on the
2009,"view that species are only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might"
2009,expect often to find them still continuing to vary in those parts of
2009,"their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period, and"
2009,which have thus come to differ. Or to state the case in another manner:
2009,"the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other, and"
2009,"in which they differ from allied genera, are called generic characters;"
2009,and these characters may be attributed to inheritance from a common
2009,"progenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will"
2009,"have modified several distinct species, fitted to more or less widely"
2009,"different habits, in exactly the same manner: and as these so-called"
2009,generic characters have been inherited from before the period when the
2009,"several species first branched off from their common progenitor, and"
2009,"subsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree, or only in"
2009,"a slight degree, it is not probable that they should vary at the present"
2009,"day. On the other hand, the points in which species differ from other"
2009,species of the same genus are called specific characters; and as these
2009,specific characters have varied and come to differ since the period when
2009,"the species branched off from a common progenitor, it is probable"
2009,that they should still often be in some degree variable--at least more
2009,variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very long
2009,period remained constant.
2009,
2009,SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS VARIABLE.
2009,
2009,"I think it will be admitted by naturalists, without my entering on"
2009,"details, that secondary sexual characters are highly variable. It will"
2009,also be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other
2009,"more widely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts"
2009,"of their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference"
2009,"between the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual"
2009,"characters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between"
2009,the females. The cause of the original variability of these characters
2009,is not manifest; but we can see why they should not have been rendered
2009,"as constant and uniform as others, for they are accumulated by sexual"
2009,"selection, which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection,"
2009,"as it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the"
2009,less favoured males. Whatever the cause may be of the variability
2009,"of secondary sexual characters, as they are highly variable, sexual"
2009,"selection will have had a wide scope for action, and may thus have"
2009,succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a greater amount of
2009,difference in these than in other respects.
2009,
2009,"It is a remarkable fact, that the secondary differences between the two"
2009,sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same parts
2009,of the organisation in which the species of the same genus differ from
2009,each other. Of this fact I will give in illustration the first two
2009,instances which happen to stand on my list; and as the differences in
2009,"these cases are of a very unusual nature, the relation can hardly be"
2009,accidental. The same number of joints in the tarsi is a character common
2009,"to very large groups of beetles, but in the Engidae, as Westwood has"
2009,"remarked, the number varies greatly and the number likewise differs in"
2009,"the two sexes of the same species. Again in the fossorial hymenoptera,"
2009,"the neuration of the wings is a character of the highest importance,"
2009,because common to large groups; but in certain genera the neuration
2009,"differs in the different species, and likewise in the two sexes of the"
2009,"same species. Sir J. Lubbock has recently remarked, that several minute"
2009,"crustaceans offer excellent illustrations of this law. ""In Pontella,"
2009,"for instance, the sexual characters are afforded mainly by the anterior"
2009,antennae and by the fifth pair of legs: the specific differences also
2009,"are principally given by these organs."" This relation has a clear"
2009,meaning on my view: I look at all the species of the same genus as
2009,"having as certainly descended from the same progenitor, as have the two"
2009,"sexes of any one species. Consequently, whatever part of the structure"
2009,"of the common progenitor, or of its early descendants, became variable;"
2009,"variations of this part would, it is highly probable, be taken advantage"
2009,"of by natural and sexual selection, in order to fit the several places"
2009,"in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same"
2009,"species to each other, or to fit the males to struggle with other males"
2009,for the possession of the females.
2009,
2009,"Finally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific"
2009,"characters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of"
2009,"generic characters, or those which are possessed by all the species;"
2009,that the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in
2009,a species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in
2009,"its congeners; and the slight degree of variability in a part, however"
2009,"extraordinarily it may be developed, if it be common to a whole group of"
2009,species; that the great variability of secondary sexual characters and
2009,their great difference in closely allied species; that secondary sexual
2009,and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed in the
2009,"same parts of the organisation, are all principles closely connected"
2009,together. All being mainly due to the species of the same group being
2009,"the descendants of a common progenitor, from whom they have inherited"
2009,"much in common, to parts which have recently and largely varied being"
2009,more likely still to go on varying than parts which have long been
2009,"inherited and have not varied, to natural selection having more or less"
2009,"completely, according to the lapse of time, overmastered the tendency"
2009,"to reversion and to further variability, to sexual selection being"
2009,"less rigid than ordinary selection, and to variations in the same parts"
2009,"having been accumulated by natural and sexual selection, and thus having"
2009,"been adapted for secondary sexual, and for ordinary purposes."
2009,
2009,"DISTINCT SPECIES PRESENT ANALOGOUS VARIATIONS, SO THAT A VARIETY OF"
2009,"ONE SPECIES OFTEN ASSUMES A CHARACTER PROPER TO AN ALLIED SPECIES, OR"
2009,REVERTS TO SOME OF THE CHARACTERS OF AN EARLY PROGENITOR.
2009,
2009,These propositions will be most readily understood by looking to our
2009,"domestic races. The most distinct breeds of the pigeon, in countries"
2009,"widely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the"
2009,"head, and with feathers on the feet, characters not possessed by the"
2009,aboriginal rock-pigeon; these then are analogous variations in two or
2009,more distinct races. The frequent presence of fourteen or even
2009,sixteen tail-feathers in the pouter may be considered as a variation
2009,"representing the normal structure of another race, the fantail. I"
2009,presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous variations are
2009,due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from a common
2009,"parent the same constitution and tendency to variation, when acted on by"
2009,similar unknown influences. In the vegetable kingdom we have a case of
2009,"analogous variation, in the enlarged stems, or as commonly called roots,"
2009,"of the Swedish turnip and ruta-baga, plants which several botanists rank"
2009,as varieties produced by cultivation from a common parent: if this
2009,"be not so, the case will then be one of analogous variation in two"
2009,"so-called distinct species; and to these a third may be added, namely,"
2009,the common turnip. According to the ordinary view of each species having
2009,"been independently created, we should have to attribute this similarity"
2009,"in the enlarged stems of these three plants, not to the vera causa"
2009,"of community of descent, and a consequent tendency to vary in a like"
2009,"manner, but to three separate yet closely related acts of creation. Many"
2009,similar cases of analogous variation have been observed by Naudin in the
2009,"great gourd family, and by various authors in our cereals. Similar"
2009,cases occurring with insects under natural conditions have lately been
2009,"discussed with much ability by Mr. Walsh, who has grouped them under his"
2009,law of equable variability.
2009,
2009,"With pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the occasional"
2009,"appearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars"
2009,"on the wings, white loins, a bar at the end of the tail, with the outer"
2009,feathers externally edged near their bases with white. As all these
2009,"marks are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no"
2009,"one will doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet"
2009,"analogous variation appearing in the several breeds. We may, I think,"
2009,"confidently come to this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these"
2009,coloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring
2009,of two distinct and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there
2009,is nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance
2009,"of the slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the"
2009,mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.
2009,
2009,No doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear
2009,"after having been lost for many, probably for hundreds of generations."
2009,"But when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the"
2009,offspring occasionally show for many generations a tendency to revert in
2009,"character to the foreign breed--some say, for a dozen or even a score of"
2009,"generations. After twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to use a"
2009,"common expression, from one ancestor, is only  in ; and yet, as we"
2009,"see, it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained"
2009,by this remnant of foreign blood. In a breed which has not been
2009,"crossed, but in which BOTH parents have lost some character which their"
2009,"progenitor possessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak, to reproduce"
2009,"the lost character might, as was formerly remarked, for all that we"
2009,"can see to the contrary, be transmitted for almost any number of"
2009,"generations. When a character which has been lost in a breed, reappears"
2009,"after a great number of generations, the most probable hypothesis is,"
2009,not that one individual suddenly takes after an ancestor removed by
2009,"some hundred generations, but that in each successive generation the"
2009,"character in question has been lying latent, and at last, under unknown"
2009,"favourable conditions, is developed. With the barb-pigeon, for instance,"
2009,"which very rarely produces a blue bird, it is probable that there is a"
2009,latent tendency in each generation to produce blue plumage. The abstract
2009,improbability of such a tendency being transmitted through a vast number
2009,"of generations, is not greater than that of quite useless or rudimentary"
2009,organs being similarly transmitted. A mere tendency to produce a
2009,rudiment is indeed sometimes thus inherited.
2009,
2009,As all the species of the same genus are supposed to be descended from
2009,"a common progenitor, it might be expected that they would occasionally"
2009,vary in an analogous manner; so that the varieties of two or more
2009,"species would resemble each other, or that a variety of one species"
2009,"would resemble in certain characters another and distinct species,"
2009,"this other species being, according to our view, only a well-marked and"
2009,permanent variety. But characters exclusively due to analogous variation
2009,"would probably be of an unimportant nature, for the preservation of"
2009,all functionally important characters will have been determined through
2009,"natural selection, in accordance with the different habits of the"
2009,species. It might further be expected that the species of the same
2009,genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to long-lost characters.
2009,"As, however, we do not know the common ancestor of any natural group,"
2009,we cannot distinguish between reversionary and analogous characters.
2009,"If, for instance, we did not know that the parent rock-pigeon was not"
2009,"feather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not have told, whether such"
2009,characters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous
2009,variations; but we might have inferred that the blue colour was a case
2009,"of reversion from the number of the markings, which are correlated with"
2009,"this tint, and which would not probably have all appeared together from"
2009,simple variation. More especially we might have inferred this from the
2009,blue colour and the several marks so often appearing when differently
2009,"coloured breeds are crossed. Hence, although under nature it must"
2009,"generally be left doubtful, what cases are reversions to formerly"
2009,"existing characters, and what are new but analogous variations, yet"
2009,"we ought, on our theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring of a"
2009,species assuming characters which are already present in other members
2009,of the same group. And this undoubtedly is the case.
2009,
2009,The difficulty in distinguishing variable species is largely due to
2009,"the varieties mocking, as it were, other species of the same genus."
2009,"A considerable catalogue, also, could be given of forms intermediate"
2009,"between two other forms, which themselves can only doubtfully be ranked"
2009,"as species; and this shows, unless all these closely allied forms be"
2009,"considered as independently created species, that they have in varying"
2009,assumed some of the characters of the others. But the best evidence of
2009,analogous variations is afforded by parts or organs which are generally
2009,"constant in character, but which occasionally vary so as to resemble,"
2009,"in some degree, the same part or organ in an allied species. I have"
2009,"collected a long list of such cases; but here, as before, I lie under"
2009,the great disadvantage of not being able to give them. I can only repeat
2009,"that such cases certainly occur, and seem to me very remarkable."
2009,
2009,"I will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as"
2009,"affecting any important character, but from occurring in several species"
2009,"of the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under nature."
2009,It is a case almost certainly of reversion. The ass sometimes has very
2009,"distinct transverse bars on its legs, like those on the legs of a zebra."
2009,"It has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal, and from"
2009,"inquiries which I have made, I believe this to be true. The stripe on"
2009,"the shoulder is sometimes double, and is very variable in length and"
2009,"outline. A white ass, but NOT an albino, has been described without"
2009,either spinal or shoulder stripe; and these stripes are sometimes very
2009,"obscure, or actually quite lost, in dark-coloured asses. The koulan"
2009,of Pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe.
2009,Mr. Blyth has seen a specimen of the hemionus with a distinct
2009,"shoulder-stripe, though it properly has none; and I have been informed"
2009,by Colonel Poole that foals of this species are generally striped on the
2009,"legs and faintly on the shoulder. The quagga, though so plainly barred"
2009,"like a zebra over the body, is without bars on the legs; but Dr. Gray"
2009,has figured one specimen with very distinct zebra-like bars on the
2009,hocks.
2009,
2009,"With respect to the horse, I have collected cases in England of the"
2009,"spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of ALL colours;"
2009,"transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns, and in one"
2009,instance in a chestnut; a faint shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen
2009,"in duns, and I have seen a trace in a bay horse. My son made a careful"
2009,examination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian cart-horse with a double
2009,stripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes. I have myself seen a dun
2009,"Devonshire pony, and a small dun Welsh pony has been carefully described"
2009,"to me, both with THREE parallel stripes on each shoulder."
2009,
2009,In the northwest part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so
2009,"generally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who examined"
2009,"this breed for the Indian Government, a horse without stripes is not"
2009,considered as purely bred. The spine is always striped; the legs are
2009,"generally barred; and the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double"
2009,"and sometimes treble, is common; the side of the face, moreover, is"
2009,sometimes striped. The stripes are often plainest in the foal; and
2009,sometimes quite disappear in old horses. Colonel Poole has seen both
2009,gray and bay Kattywar horses striped when first foaled. I have also
2009,"reason to suspect, from information given me by Mr. W.W. Edwards, that"
2009,with the English race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the
2009,foal than in the full-grown animal. I have myself recently bred a foal
2009,from a bay mare (offspring of a Turkoman horse and a Flemish mare) by
2009,"a bay English race-horse. This foal, when a week old, was marked on its"
2009,"hinder quarters and on its forehead with numerous very narrow, dark,"
2009,"zebra-like bars, and its legs were feebly striped. All the stripes soon"
2009,disappeared completely. Without here entering on further details I may
2009,state that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses
2009,of very different breeds in various countries from Britain to Eastern
2009,China; and from Norway in the north to the Malay Archipelago in the
2009,south. In all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest
2009,in duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of colour is
2009,"included, from one between brown and black to a close approach to cream"
2009,colour.
2009,
2009,"I am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith, who has written on this subject,"
2009,believes that the several breeds of the horse are descended from several
2009,"aboriginal species, one of which, the dun, was striped; and that the"
2009,above-described appearances are all due to ancient crosses with the dun
2009,"stock. But this view may be safely rejected, for it is highly improbable"
2009,"that the heavy Belgian cart-horse, Welsh ponies, Norwegian cobs, the"
2009,"lanky Kattywar race, etc., inhabiting the most distant parts of the"
2009,"world, should have all have been crossed with one supposed aboriginal"
2009,stock.
2009,
2009,Now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the
2009,horse genus. Rollin asserts that the common mule from the ass and horse
2009,"is particularly apt to have bars on its legs; according to Mr. Gosse,"
2009,"in certain parts of the United States, about nine out of ten mules have"
2009,striped legs. I once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any
2009,"one might have thought that it was a hybrid zebra; and Mr. W.C. Martin,"
2009,"in his excellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of a similar"
2009,"mule. In four coloured drawings, which I have seen, of hybrids between"
2009,"the ass and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest"
2009,of the body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe. In
2009,"Lord Morton's famous hybrid, from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the"
2009,hybrid and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the same
2009,"mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the"
2009,"legs than is even the pure quagga. Lastly, and this is another most"
2009,"remarkable case, a hybrid has been figured by Dr. Gray (and he informs"
2009,me that he knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus; and
2009,"this hybrid, though the ass only occasionally has stripes on his"
2009,"legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe,"
2009,"nevertheless had all four legs barred, and had three short"
2009,"shoulder-stripes, like those on the dun Devonshire and Welsh ponies, and"
2009,even had some zebra-like stripes on the sides of its face. With respect
2009,"to this last fact, I was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour"
2009,"appears from what is commonly called chance, that I was led solely"
2009,from the occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and
2009,hemionus to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever occurred
2009,"in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of horses, and was, as we have"
2009,"seen, answered in the affirmative."
2009,
2009,What now are we to say to these several facts? We see several distinct
2009,"species of the horse genus becoming, by simple variation, striped on the"
2009,"legs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like an ass. In the horse"
2009,we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appears--a tint which
2009,approaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the
2009,genus. The appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change
2009,"of form, or by any other new character. We see this tendency to become"
2009,striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the
2009,most distinct species. Now observe the case of the several breeds
2009,of pigeons: they are descended from a pigeon (including two or three
2009,"sub-species or geographical races) of a bluish colour, with certain bars"
2009,and other marks; and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish
2009,"tint, these bars and other marks invariably reappear; but without any"
2009,other change of form or character. When the oldest and truest breeds of
2009,"various colours are crossed, we see a strong tendency for the blue tint"
2009,and bars and marks to reappear in the mongrels. I have stated that the
2009,most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient
2009,"characters, is--that there is a TENDENCY in the young of each successive"
2009,"generation to produce the long-lost character, and that this tendency,"
2009,"from unknown causes, sometimes prevails. And we have just seen that in"
2009,several species of the horse genus the stripes are either plainer or
2009,appear more commonly in the young than in the old. Call the breeds of
2009,"pigeons, some of which have bred true for centuries, species; and how"
2009,exactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the horse
2009,"genus! For myself, I venture confidently to look back thousands on"
2009,"thousands of generations, and I see an animal striped like a zebra, but"
2009,"perhaps otherwise very differently constructed, the common parent of"
2009,our domestic horse (whether or not it be descended from one or more wild
2009,"stocks) of the ass, the hemionus, quagga, and zebra."
2009,
2009,"He who believes that each equine species was independently created,"
2009,"will, I presume, assert that each species has been created with a"
2009,"tendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in this"
2009,"particular manner, so as often to become striped like the other species"
2009,"of the genus; and that each has been created with a strong tendency,"
2009,"when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world, to"
2009,"produce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not their own parents, but"
2009,"other species of the genus. To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to"
2009,"reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown cause. It makes"
2009,the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon
2009,"believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had"
2009,"never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now"
2009,living on the sea-shore.
2009,
2009,SUMMARY.
2009,
2009,Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. Not in one case out
2009,of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part
2009,"has varied. But whenever we have the means of instituting a comparison,"
2009,the same laws appear to have acted in producing the lesser differences
2009,"between varieties of the same species, and the greater differences"
2009,between species of the same genus. Changed conditions generally induce
2009,"mere fluctuating variability, but sometimes they cause direct and"
2009,definite effects; and these may become strongly marked in the course
2009,"of time, though we have not sufficient evidence on this head. Habit in"
2009,"producing constitutional peculiarities, and use in strengthening, and"
2009,"disuse in weakening and diminishing organs, appear in many cases to have"
2009,been potent in their effects. Homologous parts tend to vary in the same
2009,"manner, and homologous parts tend to cohere. Modifications in hard parts"
2009,and in external parts sometimes affect softer and internal parts. When
2009,"one part is largely developed, perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from"
2009,the adjoining parts; and every part of the structure which can be saved
2009,without detriment will be saved. Changes of structure at an early age
2009,may affect parts subsequently developed; and many cases of correlated
2009,"variation, the nature of which we are unable to understand, undoubtedly"
2009,"occur. Multiple parts are variable in number and in structure, perhaps"
2009,arising from such parts not having been closely specialised for any
2009,"particular function, so that their modifications have not been closely"
2009,"checked by natural selection. It follows probably from this same cause,"
2009,that organic beings low in the scale are more variable than those
2009,"standing higher in the scale, and which have their whole organisation"
2009,"more specialised. Rudimentary organs, from being useless, are not"
2009,"regulated by natural selection, and hence are variable. Specific"
2009,"characters--that is, the characters which have come to differ since the"
2009,several species of the same genus branched off from a common parent--are
2009,"more variable than generic characters, or those which have long been"
2009,"inherited, and have not differed within this same period. In these"
2009,remarks we have referred to special parts or organs being still
2009,"variable, because they have recently varied and thus come to differ; but"
2009,we have also seen in the second chapter that the same principle applies
2009,to the whole individual; for in a district where many species of a
2009,"genus are found--that is, where there has been much former variation and"
2009,"differentiation, or where the manufactory of new specific forms has been"
2009,"actively at work--in that district and among these species, we now find,"
2009,"on an average, most varieties. Secondary sexual characters are highly"
2009,"variable, and such characters differ much in the species of the same"
2009,group. Variability in the same parts of the organisation has generally
2009,been taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the
2009,"two sexes of the same species, and specific differences to the"
2009,several species of the same genus. Any part or organ developed to an
2009,"extraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner, in comparison with"
2009,"the same part or organ in the allied species, must have gone through an"
2009,extraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose; and thus we
2009,can understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher
2009,degree than other parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow
2009,"process, and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had"
2009,time to overcome the tendency to further variability and to
2009,reversion to a less modified state. But when a species with an
2009,extraordinarily developed organ has become the parent of many modified
2009,"descendants--which on our view must be a very slow process, requiring a"
2009,"long lapse of time--in this case, natural selection has succeeded in"
2009,"giving a fixed character to the organ, in however extraordinary a manner"
2009,it may have been developed. Species inheriting nearly the same
2009,"constitution from a common parent, and exposed to similar influences,"
2009,"naturally tend to present analogous variations, or these same species"
2009,may occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient
2009,progenitors. Although new and important modifications may not arise from
2009,"reversion and analogous variation, such modifications will add to the"
2009,beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature.
2009,
2009,Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference between the
2009,offspring and their parents--and a cause for each must exist--we have
2009,reason to believe that it is the steady accumulation of beneficial
2009,differences which has given rise to all the more important modifications
2009,of structure in relation to the habits of each species.

2009,CHAPTER VI. DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY.
2009,
2009, Difficulties of the theory of descent with modification--Absence
2009, or rarity of transitional varieties--Transitions in habits of
2009, life--Diversified habits in the same species--Species with habits
2009, widely different from those of their allies--Organs of extreme
2009, perfection--Modes of transition--Cases of difficulty--Natura non facit
2009, saltum--Organs of small importance--Organs not in all cases absolutely
2009, perfect--The law of Unity of Type and of the Conditions of Existence
2009, embraced by the theory of Natural Selection.
2009,
2009,
2009,"Long before the reader has arrived at this part of my work, a crowd of"
2009,difficulties will have occurred to him. Some of them are so serious that
2009,to this day I can hardly reflect on them without being in some degree
2009,"staggered; but, to the best of my judgment, the greater number are only"
2009,"apparent, and those that are real are not, I think, fatal to the theory."
2009,
2009,These difficulties and objections may be classed under the following
2009,"heads: First, why, if species have descended from other species by fine"
2009,"gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why"
2009,"is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see"
2009,"them, well defined?"
2009,
2009,"Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance,"
2009,"the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the"
2009,modification of some other animal with widely different habits and
2009,"structure? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on"
2009,"the one hand, an organ of trifling importance, such as the tail of a"
2009,"giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, an organ"
2009,so wonderful as the eye?
2009,
2009,"Thirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural"
2009,selection? What shall we say to the instinct which leads the bee to make
2009,"cells, and which has practically anticipated the discoveries of profound"
2009,mathematicians?
2009,
2009,"Fourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being sterile"
2009,"and producing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are crossed,"
2009,their fertility is unimpaired?
2009,
2009,The two first heads will be here discussed; some miscellaneous
2009,objections in the following chapter; Instinct and Hybridism in the two
2009,succeeding chapters.
2009,
2009,ON THE ABSENCE OR RARITY OF TRANSITIONAL VARIETIES.
2009,
2009,As natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable
2009,"modifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to"
2009,"take the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved"
2009,parent-form and other less-favoured forms with which it comes into
2009,competition. Thus extinction and natural selection go hand in hand.
2009,"Hence, if we look at each species as descended from some unknown form,"
2009,both the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have
2009,been exterminated by the very process of the formation and perfection of
2009,the new form.
2009,
2009,"But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed,"
2009,why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of
2009,the earth? It will be more convenient to discuss this question in the
2009,chapter on the imperfection of the geological record; and I will here
2009,only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being
2009,incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed. The crust of
2009,the earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been
2009,"imperfectly made, and only at long intervals of time."
2009,
2009,But it may be urged that when several closely allied species inhabit
2009,"the same territory, we surely ought to find at the present time many"
2009,transitional forms. Let us take a simple case: in travelling from north
2009,"to south over a continent, we generally meet at successive intervals"
2009,"with closely allied or representative species, evidently filling nearly"
2009,the same place in the natural economy of the land. These representative
2009,species often meet and interlock; and as the one becomes rarer and
2009,"rarer, the other becomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces"
2009,"the other. But if we compare these species where they intermingle, they"
2009,are generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of
2009,structure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each.
2009,By my theory these allied species are descended from a common parent;
2009,"and during the process of modification, each has become adapted to"
2009,"the conditions of life of its own region, and has supplanted and"
2009,exterminated its original parent-form and all the transitional varieties
2009,between its past and present states. Hence we ought not to expect at
2009,the present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in each
2009,"region, though they must have existed there, and may be embedded"
2009,"there in a fossil condition. But in the intermediate region, having"
2009,"intermediate conditions of life, why do we not now find closely-linking"
2009,intermediate varieties? This difficulty for a long time quite confounded
2009,me. But I think it can be in large part explained.
2009,
2009,"In the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring, because"
2009,"an area is now continuous, that it has been continuous during a long"
2009,period. Geology would lead us to believe that most continents have been
2009,broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods; and in
2009,such islands distinct species might have been separately formed without
2009,the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate
2009,"zones. By changes in the form of the land and of climate, marine areas"
2009,now continuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less
2009,continuous and uniform condition than at present. But I will pass
2009,over this way of escaping from the difficulty; for I believe that many
2009,perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas;
2009,though I do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas
2009,"now continuous, has played an important part in the formation of new"
2009,"species, more especially with freely-crossing and wandering animals."
2009,
2009,"In looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area,"
2009,"we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then"
2009,"becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally"
2009,disappearing. Hence the neutral territory between two representative
2009,species is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to
2009,"each. We see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes it"
2009,"is quite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph. De Candolle has observed, a"
2009,common alpine species disappears. The same fact has been noticed by E.
2009,Forbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. To those who
2009,look at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important
2009,"elements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as"
2009,climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly. But when we
2009,"bear in mind that almost every species, even in its metropolis, would"
2009,"increase immensely in numbers, were it not for other competing species;"
2009,"that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others; in short,"
2009,that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in the
2009,most important manner to other organic beings--we see that the range
2009,of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends
2009,"on insensibly changing physical conditions, but in large part on"
2009,"the presence of other species, on which it lives, or by which it is"
2009,"destroyed, or with which it comes into competition; and as these species"
2009,"are already defined objects, not blending one into another by insensible"
2009,"gradations, the range of any one species, depending as it does on the"
2009,"range of others, will tend to be sharply defined. Moreover, each species"
2009,"on the confines of its range, where it exists in lessened numbers, will,"
2009,"during fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey, or in"
2009,"the nature of the seasons, be extremely liable to utter extermination;"
2009,and thus its geographical range will come to be still more sharply
2009,defined.
2009,
2009,"As allied or representative species, when inhabiting a continuous area,"
2009,"are generally distributed in such a manner that each has a wide range,"
2009,"with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in which"
2009,"they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do not"
2009,"essentially differ from species, the same rule will probably apply to"
2009,"both; and if we take a varying species inhabiting a very large area,"
2009,"we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a third"
2009,"variety to a narrow intermediate zone. The intermediate variety,"
2009,"consequently, will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and"
2009,"lesser area; and practically, as far as I can make out, this rule holds"
2009,good with varieties in a state of nature. I have met with striking
2009,instances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between
2009,well-marked varieties in the genus Balanus. And it would appear from
2009,"information given me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and Mr. Wollaston,"
2009,"that generally, when varieties intermediate between two other forms"
2009,"occur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they"
2009,"connect. Now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and conclude"
2009,that varieties linking two other varieties together generally have
2009,"existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then we can"
2009,understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very
2009,"long periods: why, as a general rule, they should be exterminated and"
2009,"disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together."
2009,
2009,"For any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked,"
2009,run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large
2009,numbers; and in this particular case the intermediate form would be
2009,eminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both
2009,"sides of it. But it is a far more important consideration, that during"
2009,"the process of further modification, by which two varieties are supposed"
2009,"to be converted and perfected into two distinct species, the two which"
2009,"exist in larger numbers, from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great"
2009,"advantage over the intermediate variety, which exists in smaller numbers"
2009,in a narrow and intermediate zone. For forms existing in larger numbers
2009,"will have a better chance, within any given period, of presenting"
2009,"further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on, than"
2009,"will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers. Hence, the more"
2009,"common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the"
2009,"less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved."
2009,"It is the same principle which, as I believe, accounts for the common"
2009,"species in each country, as shown in the second chapter, presenting on"
2009,an average a greater number of well-marked varieties than do the rarer
2009,species. I may illustrate what I mean by supposing three varieties of
2009,"sheep to be kept, one adapted to an extensive mountainous region; a"
2009,"second to a comparatively narrow, hilly tract; and a third to the wide"
2009,plains at the base; and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal
2009,steadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection; the chances
2009,in this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the
2009,mountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than the
2009,"small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly tract; and consequently"
2009,the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take the place of the
2009,"less improved hill breed; and thus the two breeds, which originally"
2009,"existed in greater numbers, will come into close contact with each"
2009,"other, without the interposition of the supplanted, intermediate hill"
2009,variety.
2009,
2009,"To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined"
2009,"objects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of"
2009,"varying and intermediate links: first, because new varieties are very"
2009,"slowly formed, for variation is a slow process, and natural selection"
2009,can do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations
2009,"occur, and until a place in the natural polity of the country can"
2009,be better filled by some modification of some one or more of its
2009,"inhabitants. And such new places will depend on slow changes of climate,"
2009,"or on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in"
2009,"a still more important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming"
2009,"slowly modified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones"
2009,"acting and reacting on each other. So that, in any one region and at"
2009,"any one time, we ought to see only a few species presenting slight"
2009,modifications of structure in some degree permanent; and this assuredly
2009,we do see.
2009,
2009,"Secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent"
2009,"period as isolated portions, in which many forms, more especially"
2009,"among the classes which unite for each birth and wander much, may have"
2009,separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative
2009,"species. In this case, intermediate varieties between the several"
2009,"representative species and their common parent, must formerly have"
2009,"existed within each isolated portion of the land, but these links"
2009,during the process of natural selection will have been supplanted and
2009,"exterminated, so that they will no longer be found in a living state."
2009,
2009,"Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different"
2009,"portions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it"
2009,"is probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but"
2009,they will generally have had a short duration. For these intermediate
2009,"varieties will, from reasons already assigned (namely from what we know"
2009,"of the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species,"
2009,"and likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate zones"
2009,in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect. From
2009,this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental
2009,extermination; and during the process of further modification through
2009,"natural selection, they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted"
2009,"by the forms which they connect; for these, from existing in greater"
2009,"numbers will, in the aggregate, present more varieties, and thus be"
2009,further improved through natural selection and gain further advantages.
2009,
2009,"Lastly, looking not to any one time, but at all time, if my theory be"
2009,"true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all"
2009,"the species of the same group, must assuredly have existed; but the"
2009,"very process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often"
2009,"remarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links."
2009,Consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only
2009,"among fossil remains, which are preserved, as we shall attempt to show"
2009,"in a future chapter, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record."
2009,
2009,ON THE ORIGIN AND TRANSITION OF ORGANIC BEINGS WITH PECULIAR HABITS AND
2009,STRUCTURE.
2009,
2009,"It has been asked by the opponents of such views as I hold, how, for"
2009,"instance, could a land carnivorous animal have been converted into one"
2009,with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its transitional
2009,state have subsisted? It would be easy to show that there now exist
2009,carnivorous animals presenting close intermediate grades from strictly
2009,terrestrial to aquatic habits; and as each exists by a struggle for
2009,"life, it is clear that each must be well adapted to its place in nature."
2009,"Look at the Mustela vison of North America, which has webbed feet,"
2009,"and which resembles an otter in its fur, short legs, and form of tail;"
2009,"during summer this animal dives for and preys on fish, but during the"
2009,"long winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys, like other polecats"
2009,"on mice and land animals. If a different case had been taken, and it"
2009,had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been
2009,"converted into a flying bat, the question would have been far more"
2009,difficult to answer. Yet I think such difficulties have little weight.
2009,
2009,"Here, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage, for, out"
2009,"of the many striking cases which I have collected, I can give only"
2009,one or two instances of transitional habits and structures in allied
2009,"species; and of diversified habits, either constant or occasional, in"
2009,the same species. And it seems to me that nothing less than a long list
2009,of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any particular
2009,case like that of the bat.
2009,
2009,Look at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation from
2009,"animals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from others, as"
2009,"Sir J. Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies"
2009,"rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the"
2009,so-called flying squirrels; and flying squirrels have their limbs and
2009,"even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin, which"
2009,serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to
2009,an astonishing distance from tree to tree. We cannot doubt that each
2009,"structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country, by"
2009,"enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food more"
2009,"quickly, or, as there is reason to believe, to lessen the danger"
2009,from occasional falls. But it does not follow from this fact that the
2009,structure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive
2009,"under all possible conditions. Let the climate and vegetation change,"
2009,"let other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old ones"
2009,"become modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that some,"
2009,"at least, of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become"
2009,"exterminated, unless they also become modified and improved in structure"
2009,"in a corresponding manner. Therefore, I can see no difficulty,"
2009,"more especially under changing conditions of life, in the continued"
2009,"preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank-membranes,"
2009,"each modification being useful, each being propagated, until, by the"
2009,"accumulated effects of this process of natural selection, a perfect"
2009,so-called flying squirrel was produced.
2009,
2009,"Now look at the Galeopithecus or so-called flying lemur, which was"
2009,"formerly ranked among bats, but is now believed to belong to the"
2009,Insectivora. An extremely wide flank-membrane stretches from the corners
2009,"of the jaw to the tail, and includes the limbs with the elongated"
2009,fingers. This flank-membrane is furnished with an extensor muscle.
2009,"Although no graduated links of structure, fitted for gliding through the"
2009,"air, now connect the Galeopithecus with the other Insectivora, yet there"
2009,"is no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed, and that"
2009,each was developed in the same manner as with the less perfectly gliding
2009,squirrels; each grade of structure having been useful to its possessor.
2009,Nor can I see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it
2009,possible that the membrane-connected fingers and fore-arm of the
2009,Galeopithecus might have been greatly lengthened by natural selection;
2009,"and this, as far as the organs of flight are concerned, would"
2009,have converted the animal into a bat. In certain bats in which the
2009,wing-membrane extends from the top of the shoulder to the tail and
2009,"includes the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an apparatus originally"
2009,fitted for gliding through the air rather than for flight.
2009,
2009,"If about a dozen genera of birds were to become extinct, who would have"
2009,ventured to surmise that birds might have existed which used their wings
2009,"solely as flappers, like the logger headed duck (Micropterus of Eyton);"
2009,"as fins in the water and as front legs on the land, like the penguin;"
2009,"as sails, like the ostrich; and functionally for no purpose, like the"
2009,"apteryx? Yet the structure of each of these birds is good for it, under"
2009,"the conditions of life to which it is exposed, for each has to live by a"
2009,struggle: but it is not necessarily the best possible under all possible
2009,conditions. It must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the
2009,"grades of wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all be the"
2009,"result of disuse, indicate the steps by which birds actually acquired"
2009,their perfect power of flight; but they serve to show what diversified
2009,means of transition are at least possible.
2009,
2009,Seeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the
2009,Crustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land; and seeing that
2009,"we have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most diversified"
2009,"types, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable that"
2009,"flying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising and"
2009,"turning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been modified"
2009,"into perfectly winged animals. If this had been effected, who would"
2009,have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been
2009,"inhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their incipient organs of"
2009,"flight exclusively, so far as we know, to escape being devoured by other"
2009,fish?
2009,
2009,"When we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit,"
2009,"as the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals"
2009,displaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom have
2009,"survived to the present day, for they will have been supplanted by their"
2009,"successors, which were gradually rendered more perfect through natural"
2009,"selection. Furthermore, we may conclude that transitional states between"
2009,structures fitted for very different habits of life will rarely have
2009,been developed at an early period in great numbers and under many
2009,"subordinate forms. Thus, to return to our imaginary illustration of"
2009,"the flying-fish, it does not seem probable that fishes capable of true"
2009,"flight would have been developed under many subordinate forms, for"
2009,"taking prey of many kinds in many ways, on the land and in the water,"
2009,"until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of perfection,"
2009,so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals in
2009,the battle for life. Hence the chance of discovering species with
2009,transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be
2009,"less, from their having existed in lesser numbers, than in the case of"
2009,species with fully developed structures.
2009,
2009,"I will now give two or three instances, both of diversified and of"
2009,"changed habits, in the individuals of the same species. In either case"
2009,it would be easy for natural selection to adapt the structure of the
2009,"animal to its changed habits, or exclusively to one of its several"
2009,"habits. It is, however, difficult to decide and immaterial for us,"
2009,whether habits generally change first and structure afterwards; or
2009,whether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits; both
2009,probably often occurring almost simultaneously. Of cases of changed
2009,habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the many British
2009,"insects which now feed on exotic plants, or exclusively on artificial"
2009,substances. Of diversified habits innumerable instances could be given:
2009,I have often watched a tyrant flycatcher (Saurophagus sulphuratus) in
2009,"South America, hovering over one spot and then proceeding to another,"
2009,"like a kestrel, and at other times standing stationary on the margin of"
2009,"water, and then dashing into it like a kingfisher at a fish. In our own"
2009,"country the larger titmouse (Parus major) may be seen climbing branches,"
2009,"almost like a creeper; it sometimes, like a shrike, kills small birds by"
2009,blows on the head; and I have many times seen and heard it hammering the
2009,"seeds of the yew on a branch, and thus breaking them like a nuthatch. In"
2009,North America the black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with
2009,"widely open mouth, thus catching, almost like a whale, insects in the"
2009,water.
2009,
2009,As we sometimes see individuals following habits different from those
2009,"proper to their species and to the other species of the same genus, we"
2009,might expect that such individuals would occasionally give rise to
2009,"new species, having anomalous habits, and with their structure either"
2009,slightly or considerably modified from that of their type. And such
2009,instances occur in nature. Can a more striking instance of adaptation be
2009,given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and seizing insects
2009,in the chinks of the bark? Yet in North America there are woodpeckers
2009,"which feed largely on fruit, and others with elongated wings which chase"
2009,"insects on the wing. On the plains of La Plata, where hardly a tree"
2009,"grows, there is a woodpecker (Colaptes campestris) which has two toes"
2009,"before and two behind, a long-pointed tongue, pointed tail-feathers,"
2009,"sufficiently stiff to support the bird in a vertical position on a post,"
2009,"but not so stiff as in the typical wood-peckers, and a straight, strong"
2009,"beak. The beak, however, is not so straight or so strong as in the"
2009,typical woodpeckers but it is strong enough to bore into wood. Hence
2009,"this Colaptes, in all the essential parts of its structure, is a"
2009,"woodpecker. Even in such trifling characters as the colouring, the harsh"
2009,"tone of the voice, and undulatory flight, its close blood-relationship"
2009,"to our common woodpecker is plainly declared; yet, as I can assert, not"
2009,"only from my own observations, but from those of the accurate Azara, in"
2009,"certain large districts it does not climb trees, and it makes its"
2009,"nest in holes in banks! In certain other districts, however, this same"
2009,"woodpecker, as Mr. Hudson states, frequents trees, and bores holes in"
2009,the trunk for its nest. I may mention as another illustration of the
2009,"varied habits of this genus, that a Mexican Colaptes has been described"
2009,by De Saussure as boring holes into hard wood in order to lay up a store
2009,of acorns.
2009,
2009,"Petrels are the most aerial and oceanic of birds, but, in the quiet"
2009,"sounds of Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria berardi, in its general"
2009,"habits, in its astonishing power of diving, in its manner of swimming"
2009,"and of flying when made to take flight, would be mistaken by any one for"
2009,"an auk or a grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially a petrel, but with"
2009,many parts of its organisation profoundly modified in relation to its
2009,new habits of life; whereas the woodpecker of La Plata has had its
2009,"structure only slightly modified. In the case of the water-ouzel, the"
2009,"acutest observer, by examining its dead body, would never have suspected"
2009,"its sub-aquatic habits; yet this bird, which is allied to the thrush"
2009,"family, subsists by diving,--using its wings under water and"
2009,grasping stones with its feet. All the members of the great order of
2009,"Hymenopterous insects are terrestrial, excepting the genus Proctotrupes,"
2009,which Sir John Lubbock has discovered to be aquatic in its habits; it
2009,often enters the water and dives about by the use not of its legs but of
2009,"its wings, and remains as long as four hours beneath the surface; yet"
2009,it exhibits no modification in structure in accordance with its abnormal
2009,habits.
2009,
2009,"He who believes that each being has been created as we now see it, must"
2009,occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having
2009,habits and structure not in agreement. What can be plainer than that the
2009,webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? Yet there are
2009,upland geese with webbed feet which rarely go near the water; and no one
2009,"except Audubon, has seen the frigate-bird, which has all its four toes"
2009,"webbed, alight on the surface of the ocean. On the other hand, grebes"
2009,"and coots are eminently aquatic, although their toes are only bordered"
2009,"by membrane. What seems plainer than that the long toes, not furnished"
2009,"with membrane, of the Grallatores, are formed for walking over swamps"
2009,and floating plants. The water-hen and landrail are members of this
2009,"order, yet the first is nearly as aquatic as the coot, and the second is"
2009,"nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge. In such cases, and"
2009,"many others could be given, habits have changed without a corresponding"
2009,change of structure. The webbed feet of the upland goose may be said to
2009,"have become almost rudimentary in function, though not in structure."
2009,"In the frigate-bird, the deeply scooped membrane between the toes shows"
2009,that structure has begun to change.
2009,
2009,"He who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation may say,"
2009,that in these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being of one
2009,type to take the place of one belonging to another type; but this seems
2009,to me only restating the fact in dignified language. He who believes in
2009,"the struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection,"
2009,will acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to
2009,"increase in numbers; and that if any one being varies ever so little,"
2009,"either in habits or structure, and thus gains an advantage over some"
2009,"other inhabitant of the same country, it will seize on the place of that"
2009,"inhabitant, however different that may be from its own place. Hence it"
2009,will cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate-birds
2009,"with webbed feet, living on the dry land and rarely alighting on the"
2009,"water, that there should be long-toed corncrakes, living in meadows"
2009,instead of in swamps; that there should be woodpeckers where hardly a
2009,"tree grows; that there should be diving thrushes and diving Hymenoptera,"
2009,and petrels with the habits of auks.
2009,
2009,ORGANS OF EXTREME PERFECTION AND COMPLICATION.
2009,
2009,To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for
2009,"adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different"
2009,"amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic"
2009,"aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely"
2009,"confess, absurd in the highest degree. When it was first said that the"
2009,"sun stood still and the world turned round, the common sense of mankind"
2009,"declared the doctrine false; but the old saying of Vox populi, vox Dei,"
2009,"as every philosopher knows, cannot be trusted in science. Reason tells"
2009,"me, that if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one"
2009,"complex and perfect can be shown to exist, each grade being useful to"
2009,"its possessor, as is certainly the case; if further, the eye ever varies"
2009,"and the variations be inherited, as is likewise certainly the case;"
2009,and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing
2009,"conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and"
2009,"complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by"
2009,"our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory."
2009,"How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than"
2009,"how life itself originated; but I may remark that, as some of the lowest"
2009,"organisms in which nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving"
2009,"light, it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements"
2009,"in their sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves,"
2009,endowed with this special sensibility.
2009,
2009,In searching for the gradations through which an organ in any species
2009,"has been perfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal"
2009,"progenitors; but this is scarcely ever possible, and we are forced"
2009,"to look to other species and genera of the same group, that is to the"
2009,"collateral descendants from the same parent-form, in order to see what"
2009,"gradations are possible, and for the chance of some gradations having"
2009,been transmitted in an unaltered or little altered condition. But the
2009,state of the same organ in distinct classes may incidentally throw light
2009,on the steps by which it has been perfected.
2009,
2009,The simplest organ which can be called an eye consists of an optic
2009,"nerve, surrounded by pigment-cells and covered by translucent skin, but"
2009,"without any lens or other refractive body. We may, however, according"
2009,"to M. Jourdain, descend even a step lower and find aggregates of"
2009,"pigment-cells, apparently serving as organs of vision, without any"
2009,"nerves, and resting merely on sarcodic tissue. Eyes of the above simple"
2009,"nature are not capable of distinct vision, and serve only to distinguish"
2009,"light from darkness. In certain star-fishes, small depressions in the"
2009,"layer of pigment which surrounds the nerve are filled, as described by"
2009,"the author just quoted, with transparent gelatinous matter, projecting"
2009,"with a convex surface, like the cornea in the higher animals. He"
2009,"suggests that this serves not to form an image, but only to concentrate"
2009,the luminous rays and render their perception more easy. In this
2009,concentration of the rays we gain the first and by far the most
2009,"important step towards the formation of a true, picture-forming eye; for"
2009,"we have only to place the naked extremity of the optic nerve, which in"
2009,"some of the lower animals lies deeply buried in the body, and in"
2009,"some near the surface, at the right distance from the concentrating"
2009,"apparatus, and an image will be formed on it."
2009,
2009,"In the great class of the Articulata, we may start from an optic nerve"
2009,"simply coated with pigment, the latter sometimes forming a sort of"
2009,"pupil, but destitute of lens or other optical contrivance. With insects"
2009,it is now known that the numerous facets on the cornea of their great
2009,"compound eyes form true lenses, and that the cones include curiously"
2009,modified nervous filaments. But these organs in the Articulata are so
2009,much diversified that Muller formerly made three main classes with seven
2009,"subdivisions, besides a fourth main class of aggregated simple eyes."
2009,
2009,"When we reflect on these facts, here given much too briefly, with"
2009,"respect to the wide, diversified, and graduated range of structure in"
2009,the eyes of the lower animals; and when we bear in mind how small the
2009,number of all living forms must be in comparison with those which have
2009,"become extinct, the difficulty ceases to be very great in believing that"
2009,natural selection may have converted the simple apparatus of an optic
2009,"nerve, coated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane, into"
2009,an optical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the
2009,Articulata class.
2009,
2009,"He who will go thus far, ought not to hesitate to go one step further,"
2009,"if he finds on finishing this volume that large bodies of facts,"
2009,"otherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the theory of modification"
2009,through natural selection; he ought to admit that a structure even as
2009,"perfect as an eagle's eye might thus be formed, although in this case"
2009,he does not know the transitional states. It has been objected that in
2009,"order to modify the eye and still preserve it as a perfect instrument,"
2009,"many changes would have to be effected simultaneously, which, it is"
2009,"assumed, could not be done through natural selection; but as I have"
2009,"attempted to show in my work on the variation of domestic animals, it is"
2009,"not necessary to suppose that the modifications were all simultaneous,"
2009,if they were extremely slight and gradual. Different kinds of
2009,"modification would, also, serve for the same general purpose: as Mr."
2009,"Wallace has remarked, ""If a lens has too short or too long a focus, it"
2009,"may be amended either by an alteration of curvature, or an alteration of"
2009,"density; if the curvature be irregular, and the rays do not converge"
2009,"to a point, then any increased regularity of curvature will be an"
2009,improvement. So the contraction of the iris and the muscular
2009,"movements of the eye are neither of them essential to vision, but only"
2009,improvements which might have been added and perfected at any stage of
2009,"the construction of the instrument."" Within the highest division of"
2009,"the animal kingdom, namely, the Vertebrata, we can start from an eye"
2009,"so simple, that it consists, as in the lancelet, of a little sack of"
2009,"transparent skin, furnished with a nerve and lined with pigment, but"
2009,"destitute of any other apparatus. In fishes and reptiles, as Owen has"
2009,"remarked, ""The range of gradation of dioptric structures is very"
2009,"great."" It is a significant fact that even in man, according to the high"
2009,"authority of Virchow, the beautiful crystalline lens is formed in the"
2009,"embryo by an accumulation of epidermic cells, lying in a sack-like fold"
2009,of the skin; and the vitreous body is formed from embryonic subcutaneous
2009,"tissue. To arrive, however, at a just conclusion regarding the"
2009,"formation of the eye, with all its marvellous yet not absolutely perfect"
2009,"characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer the"
2009,imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far to keenly to be
2009,surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural
2009,selection to so startling a length.
2009,
2009,It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye with a telescope.
2009,We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued
2009,efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the
2009,eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this
2009,inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator
2009,works by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must compare the
2009,"eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick"
2009,"layer of transparent tissue, with spaces filled with fluid, and with a"
2009,"nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this"
2009,"layer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to separate"
2009,"into layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different"
2009,"distances from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly"
2009,"changing in form. Further we must suppose that there is a power,"
2009,"represented by natural selection or the survival of the fittest, always"
2009,intently watching each slight alteration in the transparent layers; and
2009,"carefully preserving each which, under varied circumstances, in any way"
2009,"or degree, tends to produce a distincter image. We must suppose each"
2009,new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; each to be
2009,"preserved until a better is produced, and then the old ones to be all"
2009,"destroyed. In living bodies, variation will cause the slight alteration,"
2009,"generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection"
2009,will pick out with unerring skill each improvement. Let this process
2009,go on for millions of years; and during each year on millions of
2009,individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical
2009,"instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the"
2009,works of the Creator are to those of man?
2009,
2009,MODES Of TRANSITION.
2009,
2009,"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which"
2009,"could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight"
2009,"modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find"
2009,out no such case. No doubt many organs exist of which we do not know
2009,"the transitional grades, more especially if we look to much-isolated"
2009,"species, around which, according to the theory, there has been much"
2009,"extinction. Or again, if we take an organ common to all the members of"
2009,"a class, for in this latter case the organ must have been originally"
2009,"formed at a remote period, since which all the many members of the class"
2009,have been developed; and in order to discover the early transitional
2009,"grades through which the organ has passed, we should have to look to"
2009,"very ancient ancestral forms, long since become extinct."
2009,
2009,We should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not
2009,have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind. Numerous cases
2009,could be given among the lower animals of the same organ performing
2009,at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus in the larva of the
2009,"dragon-fly and in the fish Cobites the alimentary canal respires,"
2009,"digests, and excretes. In the Hydra, the animal may be turned inside"
2009,"out, and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire."
2009,"In such cases natural selection might specialise, if any advantage"
2009,"were thus gained, the whole or part of an organ, which had previously"
2009,"performed two functions, for one function alone, and thus by insensible"
2009,steps greatly change its nature. Many plants are known which regularly
2009,produce at the same time differently constructed flowers; and if such
2009,"plants were to produce one kind alone, a great change would be effected"
2009,"with comparative suddenness in the character of the species. It is,"
2009,"however, probable that the two sorts of flowers borne by the same plant"
2009,"were originally differentiated by finely graduated steps, which may"
2009,still be followed in some few cases.
2009,
2009,"Again, two distinct organs, or the same organ under two very different"
2009,"forms, may simultaneously perform in the same individual the same"
2009,"function, and this is an extremely important means of transition: to"
2009,give one instance--there are fish with gills or branchiae that breathe
2009,"the air dissolved in the water, at the same time that they breathe free"
2009,"air in their swim-bladders, this latter organ being divided by highly"
2009,vascular partitions and having a ductus pneumaticus for the supply of
2009,air. To give another instance from the vegetable kingdom: plants climb
2009,"by three distinct means, by spirally twining, by clasping a support with"
2009,"their sensitive tendrils, and by the emission of aerial rootlets; these"
2009,"three means are usually found in distinct groups, but some few species"
2009,"exhibit two of the means, or even all three, combined in the same"
2009,individual. In all such cases one of the two organs might readily be
2009,"modified and perfected so as to perform all the work, being aided during"
2009,the progress of modification by the other organ; and then this other
2009,"organ might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose, or be"
2009,wholly obliterated.
2009,
2009,"The illustration of the swim-bladder in fishes is a good one, because"
2009,it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally
2009,"constructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into"
2009,"one for a widely different purpose, namely respiration. The swim-bladder"
2009,"has, also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs"
2009,of certain fishes. All physiologists admit that the swim-bladder is
2009,"homologous, or ""ideally similar"" in position and structure with the"
2009,lungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there is no reason to
2009,"doubt that the swim-bladder has actually been converted into lungs, or"
2009,an organ used exclusively for respiration.
2009,
2009,According to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals
2009,with true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient
2009,and unknown prototype which was furnished with a floating apparatus or
2009,"swim-bladder. We can thus, as I infer from Professor Owen's interesting"
2009,"description of these parts, understand the strange fact that every"
2009,particle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the
2009,"orifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the lungs,"
2009,notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis
2009,is closed. In the higher Vertebrata the branchiae have wholly
2009,disappeared--but in the embryo the slits on the sides of the neck and
2009,the loop-like course of the arteries still mark their former position.
2009,But it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiae might have
2009,been gradually worked in by natural selection for some distinct purpose:
2009,"for instance, Landois has shown that the wings of insects are developed"
2009,from the trachea; it is therefore highly probable that in this great
2009,class organs which once served for respiration have been actually
2009,converted into organs for flight.
2009,
2009,"In considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in mind"
2009,"the probability of conversion from one function to another, that I will"
2009,give another instance. Pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of
2009,"skin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve, through the means"
2009,"of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they are hatched within"
2009,"the sack. These cirripedes have no branchiae, the whole surface of"
2009,"the body and of the sack, together with the small frena, serving for"
2009,"respiration. The Balanidae or sessile cirripedes, on the other hand,"
2009,"have no ovigerous frena, the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack,"
2009,"within the well-enclosed shell; but they have, in the same relative"
2009,"position with the frena, large, much-folded membranes, which freely"
2009,"communicate with the circulatory lacunae of the sack and body, and which"
2009,have been considered by all naturalists to act as branchiae. Now I
2009,think no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family are
2009,"strictly homologous with the branchiae of the other family; indeed, they"
2009,graduate into each other. Therefore it need not be doubted that the two
2009,"little folds of skin, which originally served as ovigerous frena, but"
2009,"which, likewise, very slightly aided in the act of respiration, have"
2009,"been gradually converted by natural selection into branchiae, simply"
2009,through an increase in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive
2009,"glands. If all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct, and they have"
2009,"suffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes, who would"
2009,ever have imagined that the branchiae in this latter family had
2009,originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed
2009,out of the sack?
2009,
2009,"There is another possible mode of transition, namely, through the"
2009,acceleration or retardation of the period of reproduction. This has
2009,lately been insisted on by Professor Cope and others in the United
2009,States. It is now known that some animals are capable of reproduction
2009,"at a very early age, before they have acquired their perfect characters;"
2009,"and if this power became thoroughly well developed in a species, it"
2009,seems probable that the adult stage of development would sooner or later
2009,"be lost; and in this case, especially if the larva differed much from"
2009,"the mature form, the character of the species would be greatly changed"
2009,"and degraded. Again, not a few animals, after arriving at maturity, go"
2009,"on changing in character during nearly their whole lives. With mammals,"
2009,"for instance, the form of the skull is often much altered with age, of"
2009,which Dr. Murie has given some striking instances with seals. Every
2009,"one knows how the horns of stags become more and more branched, and the"
2009,"plumes of some birds become more finely developed, as they grow older."
2009,Professor Cope states that the teeth of certain lizards change much in
2009,"shape with advancing years. With crustaceans not only many trivial,"
2009,"but some important parts assume a new character, as recorded by Fritz"
2009,"Muller, after maturity. In all such cases--and many could be given--if"
2009,"the age for reproduction were retarded, the character of the species, at"
2009,"least in its adult state, would be modified; nor is it improbable that"
2009,the previous and earlier stages of development would in some cases be
2009,hurried through and finally lost. Whether species have often or ever
2009,"been modified through this comparatively sudden mode of transition, I"
2009,"can form no opinion; but if this has occurred, it is probable that the"
2009,"differences between the young and the mature, and between the mature and"
2009,"the old, were primordially acquired by graduated steps."
2009,
2009,SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.
2009,
2009,Although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ
2009,"could not have been produced by successive, small, transitional"
2009,"gradations, yet undoubtedly serious cases of difficulty occur."
2009,
2009,"One of the most serious is that of neuter insects, which are often"
2009,differently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but
2009,this case will be treated of in the next chapter. The electric organs of
2009,fishes offer another case of special difficulty; for it is impossible
2009,to conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced. But
2009,"this is not surprising, for we do not even know of what use they are."
2009,In the gymnotus and torpedo they no doubt serve as powerful means of
2009,"defence, and perhaps for securing prey; yet in the ray, as observed"
2009,"by Matteucci, an analogous organ in the tail manifests but little"
2009,"electricity, even when the animal is greatly irritated; so little that"
2009,"it can hardly be of any use for the above purposes. Moreover, in the"
2009,"ray, besides the organ just referred to, there is, as Dr. R. McDonnell"
2009,"has shown, another organ near the head, not known to be electrical, but"
2009,which appears to be the real homologue of the electric battery in the
2009,torpedo. It is generally admitted that there exists between these organs
2009,"and ordinary muscle a close analogy, in intimate structure, in the"
2009,"distribution of the nerves, and in the manner in which they are acted"
2009,"on by various reagents. It should, also, be especially observed that"
2009,"muscular contraction is accompanied by an electrical discharge; and,"
2009,"as Dr. Radcliffe insists, ""in the electrical apparatus of the torpedo"
2009,"during rest, there would seem to be a charge in every respect like that"
2009,"which is met with in muscle and nerve during the rest, and the discharge"
2009,"of the torpedo, instead of being peculiar, may be only another form of"
2009,"the discharge which attends upon the action of muscle and motor nerve."""
2009,Beyond this we cannot at present go in the way of explanation; but as
2009,"we know so little about the uses of these organs, and as we know nothing"
2009,about the habits and structure of the progenitors of the existing
2009,"electric fishes, it would be extremely bold to maintain that no"
2009,serviceable transitions are possible by which these organs might have
2009,been gradually developed.
2009,
2009,These organs appear at first to offer another and far more serious
2009,"difficulty; for they occur in about a dozen kinds of fish, of which"
2009,several are widely remote in their affinities. When the same organ is
2009,"found in several members of the same class, especially if in members"
2009,"having very different habits of life, we may generally attribute its"
2009,presence to inheritance from a common ancestor; and its absence in some
2009,"of the members to loss through disuse or natural selection. So that, if"
2009,"the electric organs had been inherited from some one ancient progenitor,"
2009,we might have expected that all electric fishes would have been
2009,specially related to each other; but this is far from the case. Nor does
2009,geology at all lead to the belief that most fishes formerly possessed
2009,"electric organs, which their modified descendants have now lost. But"
2009,"when we look at the subject more closely, we find in the several fishes"
2009,"provided with electric organs, that these are situated in different"
2009,"parts of the body, that they differ in construction, as in the"
2009,"arrangement of the plates, and, according to Pacini, in the process or"
2009,"means by which the electricity is excited--and lastly, in being supplied"
2009,"with nerves proceeding from different sources, and this is perhaps"
2009,the most important of all the differences. Hence in the several
2009,"fishes furnished with electric organs, these cannot be considered as"
2009,"homologous, but only as analogous in function. Consequently there is"
2009,no reason to suppose that they have been inherited from a common
2009,progenitor; for had this been the case they would have closely resembled
2009,"each other in all respects. Thus the difficulty of an organ, apparently"
2009,"the same, arising in several remotely allied species, disappears,"
2009,"leaving only the lesser yet still great difficulty: namely, by what"
2009,graduated steps these organs have been developed in each separate group
2009,of fishes.
2009,
2009,"The luminous organs which occur in a few insects, belonging to widely"
2009,"different families, and which are situated in different parts of the"
2009,"body, offer, under our present state of ignorance, a difficulty almost"
2009,exactly parallel with that of the electric organs. Other similar cases
2009,"could be given; for instance in plants, the very curious contrivance of"
2009,"a mass of pollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with an adhesive gland,"
2009,"is apparently the same in Orchis and Asclepias, genera almost as remote"
2009,as is possible among flowering plants; but here again the parts are not
2009,"homologous. In all cases of beings, far removed from each other in the"
2009,"scale of organisation, which are furnished with similar and peculiar"
2009,"organs, it will be found that although the general appearance and"
2009,"function of the organs may be the same, yet fundamental differences"
2009,"between them can always be detected. For instance, the eyes of"
2009,Cephalopods or cuttle-fish and of vertebrate animals appear wonderfully
2009,alike; and in such widely sundered groups no part of this resemblance
2009,can be due to inheritance from a common progenitor. Mr. Mivart has
2009,"advanced this case as one of special difficulty, but I am unable to"
2009,see the force of his argument. An organ for vision must be formed of
2009,"transparent tissue, and must include some sort of lens for throwing"
2009,an image at the back of a darkened chamber. Beyond this superficial
2009,"resemblance, there is hardly any real similarity between the eyes of"
2009,"cuttle-fish and vertebrates, as may be seen by consulting Hensen's"
2009,admirable memoir on these organs in the Cephalopoda. It is impossible
2009,"for me here to enter on details, but I may specify a few of the points"
2009,of difference. The crystalline lens in the higher cuttle-fish consists
2009,"of two parts, placed one behind the other like two lenses, both having"
2009,a very different structure and disposition to what occurs in the
2009,"vertebrata. The retina is wholly different, with an actual inversion of"
2009,"the elemental parts, and with a large nervous ganglion included within"
2009,the membranes of the eye. The relations of the muscles are as different
2009,"as it is possible to conceive, and so in other points. Hence it is not"
2009,a little difficult to decide how far even the same terms ought to be
2009,employed in describing the eyes of the Cephalopoda and Vertebrata. It
2009,"is, of course, open to any one to deny that the eye in either case could"
2009,have been developed through the natural selection of successive slight
2009,variations; but if this be admitted in the one case it is clearly
2009,possible in the other; and fundamental differences of structure in the
2009,"visual organs of two groups might have been anticipated, in accordance"
2009,with this view of their manner of formation. As two men have sometimes
2009,"independently hit on the same invention, so in the several foregoing"
2009,"cases it appears that natural selection, working for the good of each"
2009,"being, and taking advantage of all favourable variations, has produced"
2009,"similar organs, as far as function is concerned, in distinct organic"
2009,"beings, which owe none of their structure in common to inheritance from"
2009,a common progenitor.
2009,
2009,"Fritz Muller, in order to test the conclusions arrived at in this"
2009,"volume, has followed out with much care a nearly similar line of"
2009,"argument. Several families of crustaceans include a few species,"
2009,possessing an air-breathing apparatus and fitted to live out of the
2009,"water. In two of these families, which were more especially examined by"
2009,"Muller, and which are nearly related to each other, the species agree"
2009,"most closely in all important characters: namely in their sense organs,"
2009,"circulating systems, in the position of the tufts of hair within"
2009,"their complex stomachs, and lastly in the whole structure of the"
2009,"water-breathing branchiae, even to the microscopical hooks by which they"
2009,are cleansed. Hence it might have been expected that in the few species
2009,"belonging to both families which live on the land, the equally important"
2009,air-breathing apparatus would have been the same; for why should this
2009,"one apparatus, given for the same purpose, have been made to differ,"
2009,"while all the other important organs were closely similar, or rather,"
2009,identical.
2009,
2009,Fritz Muller argues that this close similarity in so many points
2009,"of structure must, in accordance with the views advanced by me, be"
2009,accounted for by inheritance from a common progenitor. But as the vast
2009,"majority of the species in the above two families, as well as most"
2009,"other crustaceans, are aquatic in their habits, it is improbable in the"
2009,highest degree that their common progenitor should have been adapted for
2009,breathing air. Muller was thus led carefully to examine the apparatus in
2009,the air-breathing species; and he found it to differ in each in several
2009,"important points, as in the position of the orifices, in the manner in"
2009,"which they are opened and closed, and in some accessory details. Now"
2009,"such differences are intelligible, and might even have been expected, on"
2009,the supposition that species belonging to distinct families had slowly
2009,"become adapted to live more and more out of water, and to breathe the"
2009,"air. For these species, from belonging to distinct families, would have"
2009,"differed to a certain extent, and in accordance with the principle that"
2009,"the nature of each variation depends on two factors, viz., the nature of"
2009,"the organism and that of the surrounding conditions, their variability"
2009,assuredly would not have been exactly the same. Consequently natural
2009,"selection would have had different materials or variations to work on,"
2009,in order to arrive at the same functional result; and the structures
2009,thus acquired would almost necessarily have differed. On the hypothesis
2009,of separate acts of creation the whole case remains unintelligible. This
2009,line of argument seems to have had great weight in leading Fritz Muller
2009,to accept the views maintained by me in this volume.
2009,
2009,"Another distinguished zoologist, the late Professor Claparede, has"
2009,"argued in the same manner, and has arrived at the same result. He"
2009,"shows that there are parasitic mites (Acaridae), belonging to distinct"
2009,"sub-families and families, which are furnished with hair-claspers. These"
2009,"organs must have been independently developed, as they could not have"
2009,been inherited from a common progenitor; and in the several groups they
2009,"are formed by the modification of the fore legs, of the hind legs, of"
2009,"the maxillae or lips, and of appendages on the under side of the hind"
2009,part of the body.
2009,
2009,"In the foregoing cases, we see the same end gained and the same function"
2009,"performed, in beings not at all or only remotely allied, by organs in"
2009,"appearance, though not in development, closely similar. On the other"
2009,"hand, it is a common rule throughout nature that the same end should"
2009,"be gained, even sometimes in the case of closely related beings, by the"
2009,most diversified means. How differently constructed is the feathered
2009,wing of a bird and the membrane-covered wing of a bat; and still more so
2009,"the four wings of a butterfly, the two wings of a fly, and the two wings"
2009,"with the elytra of a beetle. Bivalve shells are made to open and shut,"
2009,"but on what a number of patterns is the hinge constructed, from the long"
2009,row of neatly interlocking teeth in a Nucula to the simple ligament of
2009,"a Mussel! Seeds are disseminated by their minuteness, by their capsule"
2009,"being converted into a light balloon-like envelope, by being embedded"
2009,"in pulp or flesh, formed of the most diverse parts, and rendered"
2009,"nutritious, as well as conspicuously coloured, so as to attract and"
2009,"be devoured by birds, by having hooks and grapnels of many kinds and"
2009,"serrated awns, so as to adhere to the fur of quadrupeds, and by being"
2009,"furnished with wings and plumes, as different in shape as they are"
2009,"elegant in structure, so as to be wafted by every breeze. I will give"
2009,one other instance: for this subject of the same end being gained by the
2009,most diversified means well deserves attention. Some authors maintain
2009,that organic beings have been formed in many ways for the sake of
2009,"mere variety, almost like toys in a shop, but such a view of nature is"
2009,"incredible. With plants having separated sexes, and with those in which,"
2009,"though hermaphrodites, the pollen does not spontaneously fall on the"
2009,"stigma, some aid is necessary for their fertilisation. With several"
2009,"kinds this is effected by the pollen-grains, which are light and"
2009,"incoherent, being blown by the wind through mere chance on to the"
2009,stigma; and this is the simplest plan which can well be conceived. An
2009,"almost equally simple, though very different plan occurs in many plants"
2009,"in which a symmetrical flower secretes a few drops of nectar, and is"
2009,consequently visited by insects; and these carry the pollen from the
2009,anthers to the stigma.
2009,
2009,From this simple stage we may pass through an inexhaustible number of
2009,"contrivances, all for the same purpose and effected in essentially the"
2009,"same manner, but entailing changes in every part of the flower. The"
2009,"nectar may be stored in variously shaped receptacles, with the"
2009,"stamens and pistils modified in many ways, sometimes forming trap-like"
2009,"contrivances, and sometimes capable of neatly adapted movements through"
2009,irritability or elasticity. From such structures we may advance till we
2009,come to such a case of extraordinary adaptation as that lately described
2009,by Dr. Cruger in the Coryanthes. This orchid has part of its labellum or
2009,"lower lip hollowed out into a great bucket, into which drops of almost"
2009,pure water continually fall from two secreting horns which stand above
2009,"it; and when the bucket is half-full, the water overflows by a spout on"
2009,"one side. The basal part of the labellum stands over the bucket, and is"
2009,itself hollowed out into a sort of chamber with two lateral entrances;
2009,within this chamber there are curious fleshy ridges. The most ingenious
2009,"man, if he had not witnessed what takes place, could never have imagined"
2009,what purpose all these parts serve. But Dr. Cruger saw crowds of large
2009,"humble-bees visiting the gigantic flowers of this orchid, not in order"
2009,"to suck nectar, but to gnaw off the ridges within the chamber above the"
2009,"bucket; in doing this they frequently pushed each other into the bucket,"
2009,"and their wings being thus wetted they could not fly away, but were"
2009,compelled to crawl out through the passage formed by the spout or
2009,"overflow. Dr. Cruger saw a ""continual procession"" of bees thus crawling"
2009,"out of their involuntary bath. The passage is narrow, and is roofed over"
2009,"by the column, so that a bee, in forcing its way out, first rubs its"
2009,back against the viscid stigma and then against the viscid glands of the
2009,pollen-masses. The pollen-masses are thus glued to the back of the
2009,bee which first happens to crawl out through the passage of a lately
2009,"expanded flower, and are thus carried away. Dr. Cruger sent me a flower"
2009,"in spirits of wine, with a bee which he had killed before it had quite"
2009,"crawled out, with a pollen-mass still fastened to its back. When the"
2009,"bee, thus provided, flies to another flower, or to the same flower a"
2009,"second time, and is pushed by its comrades into the bucket and then"
2009,"crawls out by the passage, the pollen-mass necessarily comes first into"
2009,"contact with the viscid stigma, and adheres to it, and the flower is"
2009,"fertilised. Now at last we see the full use of every part of the flower,"
2009,"of the water-secreting horns of the bucket half-full of water, which"
2009,"prevents the bees from flying away, and forces them to crawl out through"
2009,"the spout, and rub against the properly placed viscid pollen-masses and"
2009,the viscid stigma.
2009,
2009,"The construction of the flower in another closely allied orchid, namely,"
2009,"the Catasetum, is widely different, though serving the same end; and is"
2009,"equally curious. Bees visit these flowers, like those of the Coryanthes,"
2009,in order to gnaw the labellum; in doing this they inevitably touch
2009,"a long, tapering, sensitive projection, or, as I have called it, the"
2009,"antenna. This antenna, when touched, transmits a sensation or vibration"
2009,to a certain membrane which is instantly ruptured; this sets free a
2009,"spring by which the pollen-mass is shot forth, like an arrow, in the"
2009,"right direction, and adheres by its viscid extremity to the back of the"
2009,bee. The pollen-mass of the male plant (for the sexes are separate in
2009,"this orchid) is thus carried to the flower of the female plant, where it"
2009,"is brought into contact with the stigma, which is viscid enough to"
2009,"break certain elastic threads, and retain the pollen, thus effecting"
2009,fertilisation.
2009,
2009,"How, it may be asked, in the foregoing and in innumerable other"
2009,"instances, can we understand the graduated scale of complexity and the"
2009,"multifarious means for gaining the same end. The answer no doubt is, as"
2009,"already remarked, that when two forms vary, which already differ from"
2009,"each other in some slight degree, the variability will not be of the"
2009,"same exact nature, and consequently the results obtained through natural"
2009,selection for the same general purpose will not be the same. We should
2009,also bear in mind that every highly developed organism has passed
2009,through many changes; and that each modified structure tends to be
2009,"inherited, so that each modification will not readily be quite lost,"
2009,"but may be again and again further altered. Hence, the structure of each"
2009,"part of each species, for whatever purpose it may serve, is the sum of"
2009,"many inherited changes, through which the species has passed during its"
2009,successive adaptations to changed habits and conditions of life.
2009,
2009,"Finally, then, although in many cases it is most difficult even to"
2009,conjecture by what transitions organs could have arrived at their
2009,"present state; yet, considering how small the proportion of living and"
2009,"known forms is to the extinct and unknown, I have been astonished how"
2009,"rarely an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is"
2009,"known to lead. It is certainly true, that new organs appearing as if"
2009,created for some special purpose rarely or never appear in any being; as
2009,"indeed is shown by that old, but somewhat exaggerated, canon in natural"
2009,"history of ""Natura non facit saltum."" We meet with this admission in the"
2009,"writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as Milne Edwards"
2009,"has well expressed it, ""Nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in"
2009,"innovation."" Why, on the theory of Creation, should there be so much"
2009,variety and so little real novelty? Why should all the parts and organs
2009,"of many independent beings, each supposed to have been separately"
2009,"created for its own proper place in nature, be so commonly linked"
2009,together by graduated steps? Why should not Nature take a sudden leap
2009,"from structure to structure? On the theory of natural selection, we can"
2009,clearly understand why she should not; for natural selection acts only
2009,by taking advantage of slight successive variations; she can never take
2009,"a great and sudden leap, but must advance by the short and sure, though"
2009,slow steps.
2009,
2009,"ORGANS OF LITTLE APPARENT IMPORTANCE, AS AFFECTED BY NATURAL SELECTION."
2009,
2009,"As natural selection acts by life and death, by the survival of the"
2009,"fittest, and by the destruction of the less well-fitted individuals,"
2009,I have sometimes felt great difficulty in understanding the origin or
2009,"formation of parts of little importance; almost as great, though of"
2009,"a very different kind, as in the case of the most perfect and complex"
2009,organs.
2009,
2009,"In the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole"
2009,economy of any one organic being to say what slight modifications would
2009,be of importance or not. In a former chapter I have given instances of
2009,"very trifling characters, such as the down on fruit and the colour of"
2009,"its flesh, the colour of the skin and hair of quadrupeds, which, from"
2009,"being correlated with constitutional differences, or from determining"
2009,"the attacks of insects, might assuredly be acted on by natural"
2009,selection. The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially
2009,constructed fly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this
2009,could have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight
2009,"modifications, each better and better fitted, for so trifling an object"
2009,as to drive away flies; yet we should pause before being too positive
2009,"even in this case, for we know that the distribution and existence of"
2009,cattle and other animals in South America absolutely depend on their
2009,power of resisting the attacks of insects: so that individuals which
2009,"could by any means defend themselves from these small enemies, would be"
2009,able to range into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage. It is
2009,not that the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed (except in some
2009,"rare cases) by flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their"
2009,"strength reduced, so that they are more subject to disease, or not so"
2009,"well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food, or to escape from"
2009,beasts of prey.
2009,
2009,Organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of
2009,"high importance to an early progenitor, and, after having been slowly"
2009,"perfected at a former period, have been transmitted to existing species"
2009,"in nearly the same state, although now of very slight use; but any"
2009,actually injurious deviations in their structure would of course have
2009,been checked by natural selection. Seeing how important an organ of
2009,"locomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals, its general presence and"
2009,"use for many purposes in so many land animals, which in their lungs or"
2009,"modified swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be thus"
2009,accounted for. A well-developed tail having been formed in an aquatic
2009,"animal, it might subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of"
2009,"purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of prehension, or as an aid in"
2009,"turning, as in the case of the dog, though the aid in this latter"
2009,"respect must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any tail, can double"
2009,still more quickly.
2009,
2009,"In the second place, we may easily err in attributing importance to"
2009,"characters, and in believing that they have been developed through"
2009,natural selection. We must by no means overlook the effects of the
2009,"definite action of changed conditions of life, of so-called spontaneous"
2009,"variations, which seem to depend in a quite subordinate degree on the"
2009,"nature of the conditions, of the tendency to reversion to long-lost"
2009,"characters, of the complex laws of growth, such as of correlation,"
2009,"comprehension, of the pressure of one part on another, etc., and finally"
2009,"of sexual selection, by which characters of use to one sex are often"
2009,"gained and then transmitted more or less perfectly to the other sex,"
2009,"though of no use to the sex. But structures thus indirectly gained,"
2009,"although at first of no advantage to a species, may subsequently"
2009,"have been taken advantage of by its modified descendants, under new"
2009,conditions of life and newly acquired habits.
2009,
2009,"If green woodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there"
2009,"were many black and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have thought"
2009,that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to conceal this
2009,tree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and consequently that it was
2009,"a character of importance, and had been acquired through natural"
2009,"selection; as it is, the colour is probably in chief part due to sexual"
2009,selection. A trailing palm in the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest
2009,trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the
2009,"ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest"
2009,service to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees
2009,"which are not climbers, and which, as there is reason to believe from"
2009,the distribution of the thorn-bearing species in Africa and South
2009,"America, serve as a defence against browsing quadrupeds, so the spikes"
2009,"on the palm may at first have been developed for this object, and"
2009,"subsequently have been improved and taken advantage of by the plant, as"
2009,it underwent further modification and became a climber. The naked skin
2009,on the head of a vulture is generally considered as a direct adaptation
2009,"for wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due"
2009,to the direct action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in
2009,"drawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the"
2009,clean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked. The sutures in the skulls
2009,of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding
2009,"parturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable"
2009,for this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and
2009,"reptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that"
2009,"this structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken"
2009,advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals.
2009,
2009,We are profoundly ignorant of the cause of each slight variation or
2009,individual difference; and we are immediately made conscious of this
2009,by reflecting on the differences between the breeds of our domesticated
2009,"animals in different countries, more especially in the less civilized"
2009,"countries, where there has been but little methodical selection. Animals"
2009,kept by savages in different countries often have to struggle for
2009,"their own subsistence, and are exposed to a certain extent to natural"
2009,"selection, and individuals with slightly different constitutions would"
2009,succeed best under different climates. With cattle susceptibility to the
2009,"attacks of flies is correlated with colour, as is the liability to be"
2009,poisoned by certain plants; so that even colour would be thus subjected
2009,to the action of natural selection. Some observers are convinced that a
2009,"damp climate affects the growth of the hair, and that with the hair the"
2009,horns are correlated. Mountain breeds always differ from lowland breeds;
2009,and a mountainous country would probably affect the hind limbs from
2009,"exercising them more, and possibly even the form of the pelvis; and then"
2009,"by the law of homologous variation, the front limbs and the head would"
2009,"probably be affected. The shape, also, of the pelvis might affect"
2009,by pressure the shape of certain parts of the young in the womb. The
2009,"laborious breathing necessary in high regions tends, as we have"
2009,"good reason to believe, to increase the size of the chest; and again"
2009,"correlation would come into play. The effects of lessened exercise,"
2009,"together with abundant food, on the whole organisation is probably still"
2009,"more important, and this, as H. von Nathusius has lately shown in"
2009,"his excellent Treatise, is apparently one chief cause of the great"
2009,modification which the breeds of swine have undergone. But we are far
2009,too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the several
2009,known and unknown causes of variation; and I have made these remarks
2009,"only to show that, if we are unable to account for the characteristic"
2009,"differences of our several domestic breeds, which nevertheless are"
2009,generally admitted to have arisen through ordinary generation from
2009,"one or a few parent-stocks, we ought not to lay too much stress on"
2009,our ignorance of the precise cause of the slight analogous differences
2009,between true species.
2009,
2009,"UTILITARIAN DOCTRINE, HOW FAR TRUE: BEAUTY, HOW ACQUIRED."
2009,
2009,The foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately
2009,made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every
2009,detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor.
2009,They believe that many structures have been created for the sake of
2009,"beauty, to delight man or the Creator (but this latter point is beyond"
2009,"the scope of scientific discussion), or for the sake of mere variety,"
2009,"a view already discussed. Such doctrines, if true, would be absolutely"
2009,fatal to my theory. I fully admit that many structures are now of no
2009,"direct use to their possessors, and may never have been of any use to"
2009,their progenitors; but this does not prove that they were formed
2009,solely for beauty or variety. No doubt the definite action of changed
2009,"conditions, and the various causes of modifications, lately specified,"
2009,"have all produced an effect, probably a great effect, independently of"
2009,any advantage thus gained. But a still more important consideration is
2009,that the chief part of the organisation of every living creature is due
2009,"to inheritance; and consequently, though each being assuredly is well"
2009,"fitted for its place in nature, many structures have now no very close"
2009,"and direct relation to present habits of life. Thus, we can"
2009,"hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose, or of the"
2009,"frigate-bird, are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe"
2009,"that the similar bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of the"
2009,"horse, in the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal, are of"
2009,special use to these animals. We may safely attribute these structures
2009,to inheritance. But webbed feet no doubt were as useful to the
2009,"progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate-bird, as they now"
2009,are to the most aquatic of living birds. So we may believe that the
2009,"progenitor of the seal did not possess a flipper, but a foot with five"
2009,toes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may further venture to
2009,"believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey, horse and"
2009,"bat, were originally developed, on the principle of utility, probably"
2009,through the reduction of more numerous bones in the fin of some ancient
2009,fish-like progenitor of the whole class. It is scarcely possible to
2009,"decide how much allowance ought to be made for such causes of change,"
2009,"as the definite action of external conditions, so-called spontaneous"
2009,"variations, and the complex laws of growth; but with these important"
2009,"exceptions, we may conclude that the structure of every living creature"
2009,"either now is, or was formerly, of some direct or indirect use to its"
2009,possessor.
2009,
2009,With respect to the belief that organic beings have been created
2009,beautiful for the delight of man--a belief which it has been pronounced
2009,is subversive of my whole theory--I may first remark that the sense of
2009,"beauty obviously depends on the nature of the mind, irrespective of"
2009,any real quality in the admired object; and that the idea of what is
2009,"beautiful, is not innate or unalterable. We see this, for instance, in"
2009,the men of different races admiring an entirely different standard of
2009,beauty in their women. If beautiful objects had been created solely for
2009,"man's gratification, it ought to be shown that before man appeared"
2009,there was less beauty on the face of the earth than since he came on the
2009,"stage. Were the beautiful volute and cone shells of the Eocene epoch,"
2009,"and the gracefully sculptured ammonites of the Secondary period, created"
2009,that man might ages afterwards admire them in his cabinet? Few objects
2009,are more beautiful than the minute siliceous cases of the diatomaceae:
2009,were these created that they might be examined and admired under the
2009,"higher powers of the microscope? The beauty in this latter case, and"
2009,"in many others, is apparently wholly due to symmetry of growth. Flowers"
2009,rank among the most beautiful productions of nature; but they have
2009,"been rendered conspicuous in contrast with the green leaves, and in"
2009,"consequence at the same time beautiful, so that they may be easily"
2009,observed by insects. I have come to this conclusion from finding it an
2009,invariable rule that when a flower is fertilised by the wind it never
2009,has a gaily-coloured corolla. Several plants habitually produce two
2009,kinds of flowers; one kind open and coloured so as to attract insects;
2009,"the other closed, not coloured, destitute of nectar, and never visited"
2009,"by insects. Hence, we may conclude that, if insects had not been"
2009,"developed on the face of the earth, our plants would not have been"
2009,"decked with beautiful flowers, but would have produced only such poor"
2009,"flowers as we see on our fir, oak, nut and ash trees, on grasses,"
2009,"spinach, docks and nettles, which are all fertilised through the agency"
2009,of the wind. A similar line of argument holds good with fruits; that
2009,a ripe strawberry or cherry is as pleasing to the eye as to the
2009,palate--that the gaily-coloured fruit of the spindle-wood tree and the
2009,scarlet berries of the holly are beautiful objects--will be admitted by
2009,everyone. But this beauty serves merely as a guide to birds and
2009,"beasts, in order that the fruit may be devoured and the matured seeds"
2009,disseminated. I infer that this is the case from having as yet found
2009,no exception to the rule that seeds are always thus disseminated when
2009,embedded within a fruit of any kind (that is within a fleshy or
2009,"pulpy envelope), if it be coloured of any brilliant tint, or rendered"
2009,conspicuous by being white or black.
2009,
2009,"On the other hand, I willingly admit that a great number of male"
2009,"animals, as all our most gorgeous birds, some fishes, reptiles, and"
2009,"mammals, and a host of magnificently coloured butterflies, have been"
2009,rendered beautiful for beauty's sake. But this has been effected through
2009,"sexual selection, that is, by the more beautiful males having been"
2009,"continually preferred by the females, and not for the delight of man. So"
2009,it is with the music of birds. We may infer from all this that a nearly
2009,similar taste for beautiful colours and for musical sounds runs through
2009,a large part of the animal kingdom. When the female is as beautifully
2009,"coloured as the male, which is not rarely the case with birds and"
2009,"butterflies, the cause apparently lies in the colours acquired through"
2009,"sexual selection having been transmitted to both sexes, instead of to"
2009,"the males alone. How the sense of beauty in its simplest form--that is,"
2009,"the reception of a peculiar kind of pleasure from certain colours, forms"
2009,and sounds--was first developed in the mind of man and of the lower
2009,"animals, is a very obscure subject. The same sort of difficulty is"
2009,presented if we enquire how it is that certain flavours and odours give
2009,"pleasure, and others displeasure. Habit in all these cases appears"
2009,to have come to a certain extent into play; but there must be some
2009,fundamental cause in the constitution of the nervous system in each
2009,species.
2009,
2009,Natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in a species
2009,exclusively for the good of another species; though throughout
2009,"nature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by the"
2009,structures of others. But natural selection can and does often produce
2009,"structures for the direct injury of other animals, as we see in the fang"
2009,"of the adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its eggs"
2009,are deposited in the living bodies of other insects. If it could be
2009,proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been
2009,"formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my"
2009,"theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection."
2009,Although many statements may be found in works on natural history to
2009,"this effect, I cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight. It"
2009,is admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence
2009,and for the destruction of its prey; but some authors suppose that at
2009,"the same time it is furnished with a rattle for its own injury, namely,"
2009,to warn its prey. I would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the
2009,"end of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to warn the doomed"
2009,mouse. It is a much more probable view that the rattlesnake uses its
2009,"rattle, the cobra expands its frill and the puff-adder swells while"
2009,"hissing so loudly and harshly, in order to alarm the many birds and"
2009,beasts which are known to attack even the most venomous species. Snakes
2009,act on the same principle which makes the hen ruffle her feathers and
2009,expand her wings when a dog approaches her chickens. But I have not
2009,space here to enlarge on the many ways by which animals endeavour to
2009,frighten away their enemies.
2009,
2009,Natural selection will never produce in a being any structure more
2009,"injurious than beneficial to that being, for natural selection acts"
2009,"solely by and for the good of each. No organ will be formed, as Paley"
2009,"has remarked, for the purpose of causing pain or for doing an injury"
2009,to its possessor. If a fair balance be struck between the good and evil
2009,"caused by each part, each will be found on the whole advantageous. After"
2009,"the lapse of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part comes"
2009,"to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will"
2009,"become extinct, as myriads have become extinct."
2009,
2009,"Natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as,"
2009,or slightly more perfect than the other inhabitants of the same country
2009,with which it comes into competition. And we see that this is the
2009,standard of perfection attained under nature. The endemic productions of
2009,"New Zealand, for instance, are perfect, one compared with another; but"
2009,they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants
2009,and animals introduced from Europe. Natural selection will not produce
2009,"absolute perfection, nor do we always meet, as far as we can judge, with"
2009,this high standard under nature. The correction for the aberration of
2009,light is said by Muller not to be perfect even in that most perfect
2009,"organ, the human eye. Helmholtz, whose judgment no one will dispute,"
2009,after describing in the strongest terms the wonderful powers of the
2009,"human eye, adds these remarkable words: ""That which we have discovered"
2009,in the way of inexactness and imperfection in the optical machine and
2009,"in the image on the retina, is as nothing in comparison with the"
2009,incongruities which we have just come across in the domain of the
2009,sensations. One might say that nature has taken delight in accumulating
2009,contradictions in order to remove all foundation from the theory of a
2009,"pre-existing harmony between the external and internal worlds."" If our"
2009,reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable
2009,"contrivances in nature, this same reason tells us, though we may easily"
2009,"err on both sides, that some other contrivances are less perfect. Can we"
2009,"consider the sting of the bee as perfect, which, when used against many"
2009,"kinds of enemies, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the backward serratures,"
2009,and thus inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its
2009,viscera?
2009,
2009,"If we look at the sting of the bee, as having existed in a remote"
2009,"progenitor, as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so many"
2009,"members of the same great order, and that it has since been modified"
2009,"but not perfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally"
2009,"adapted for some other object, such as to produce galls, since"
2009,"intensified, we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of the"
2009,sting should so often cause the insect's own death: for if on the whole
2009,"the power of stinging be useful to the social community, it will fulfil"
2009,"all the requirements of natural selection, though it may cause the death"
2009,of some few members. If we admire the truly wonderful power of scent by
2009,"which the males of many insects find their females, can we admire the"
2009,"production for this single purpose of thousands of drones, which are"
2009,"utterly useless to the community for any other purpose, and which are"
2009,ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters? It may
2009,"be difficult, but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred"
2009,"of the queen-bee, which urges her to destroy the young queens, her"
2009,"daughters, as soon as they are born, or to perish herself in the combat;"
2009,for undoubtedly this is for the good of the community; and maternal love
2009,"or maternal hatred, though the latter fortunately is most rare, is all"
2009,the same to the inexorable principles of natural selection. If we admire
2009,the several ingenious contrivances by which orchids and many other
2009,"plants are fertilised through insect agency, can we consider as equally"
2009,"perfect the elaboration of dense clouds of pollen by our fir-trees, so"
2009,that a few granules may be wafted by chance on to the ovules?
2009,
2009,SUMMARY: THE LAW OF UNITY OF TYPE AND OF THE CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE
2009,EMBRACED BY THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.
2009,
2009,We have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and
2009,objections which may be urged against the theory. Many of them are
2009,serious; but I think that in the discussion light has been thrown on
2009,"several facts, which on the belief of independent acts of creation are"
2009,utterly obscure. We have seen that species at any one period are not
2009,"indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of"
2009,"intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection"
2009,"is always very slow, and at any one time acts only on a few forms;"
2009,and partly because the very process of natural selection implies the
2009,continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate
2009,"gradations. Closely allied species, now living on a continuous area,"
2009,"must often have been formed when the area was not continuous, and when"
2009,the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part to
2009,another. When two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous
2009,"area, an intermediate variety will often be formed, fitted for an"
2009,"intermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the intermediate variety"
2009,will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two forms which it
2009,"connects; consequently the two latter, during the course of further"
2009,"modification, from existing in greater numbers, will have a great"
2009,"advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety, and will thus"
2009,generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it.
2009,
2009,We have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding
2009,that the most different habits of life could not graduate into each
2009,"other; that a bat, for instance, could not have been formed by natural"
2009,selection from an animal which at first only glided through the air.
2009,
2009,We have seen that a species under new conditions of life may change its
2009,"habits, or it may have diversified habits, with some very unlike those"
2009,"of its nearest congeners. Hence we can understand, bearing in mind that"
2009,"each organic being is trying to live wherever it can live, how it has"
2009,"arisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground woodpeckers,"
2009,"diving thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks."
2009,
2009,Although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been
2009,"formed by natural selection, is enough to stagger any one; yet in"
2009,"the case of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in"
2009,"complexity, each good for its possessor, then under changing conditions"
2009,"of life, there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any"
2009,conceivable degree of perfection through natural selection. In the cases
2009,"in which we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we should"
2009,"be extremely cautious in concluding that none can have existed, for the"
2009,metamorphoses of many organs show what wonderful changes in function
2009,"are at least possible. For instance, a swim-bladder has apparently been"
2009,converted into an air-breathing lung. The same organ having performed
2009,"simultaneously very different functions, and then having been in part"
2009,or in whole specialised for one function; and two distinct organs
2009,"having performed at the same time the same function, the one having been"
2009,"perfected whilst aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated"
2009,transitions.
2009,
2009,We have seen that in two beings widely remote from each other in the
2009,"natural scale, organs serving for the same purpose and in external"
2009,appearance closely similar may have been separately and independently
2009,"formed; but when such organs are closely examined, essential differences"
2009,in their structure can almost always be detected; and this naturally
2009,"follows from the principle of natural selection. On the other hand, the"
2009,common rule throughout nature is infinite diversity of structure for
2009,gaining the same end; and this again naturally follows from the same
2009,great principle.
2009,
2009,In many cases we are far too ignorant to be enabled to assert that
2009,"a part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species, that"
2009,modifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated
2009,"by means of natural selection. In many other cases, modifications"
2009,"are probably the direct result of the laws of variation or of growth,"
2009,independently of any good having been thus gained. But even such
2009,"structures have often, as we may feel assured, been subsequently taken"
2009,"advantage of, and still further modified, for the good of species under"
2009,"new conditions of life. We may, also, believe that a part formerly of"
2009,high importance has frequently been retained (as the tail of an aquatic
2009,"animal by its terrestrial descendants), though it has become of such"
2009,"small importance that it could not, in its present state, have been"
2009,acquired by means of natural selection.
2009,
2009,Natural selection can produce nothing in one species for the exclusive
2009,"good or injury of another; though it may well produce parts, organs, and"
2009,"excretions highly useful or even indispensable, or highly injurious"
2009,"to another species, but in all cases at the same time useful to the"
2009,possessor. In each well-stocked country natural selection acts through
2009,the competition of the inhabitants and consequently leads to success
2009,"in the battle for life, only in accordance with the standard of that"
2009,"particular country. Hence the inhabitants of one country, generally the"
2009,"smaller one, often yield to the inhabitants of another and generally the"
2009,larger country. For in the larger country there will have existed more
2009,"individuals, and more diversified forms, and the competition will"
2009,"have been severer, and thus the standard of perfection will have been"
2009,rendered higher. Natural selection will not necessarily lead to absolute
2009,"perfection; nor, as far as we can judge by our limited faculties, can"
2009,absolute perfection be everywhere predicated.
2009,
2009,On the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full
2009,"meaning of that old canon in natural history, ""Natura non facit saltum."""
2009,"This canon, if we look to the present inhabitants alone of the world, is"
2009,"not strictly correct; but if we include all those of past times, whether"
2009,"known or unknown, it must on this theory be strictly true."
2009,
2009,It is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on
2009,"two great laws--Unity of Type, and the Conditions of Existence. By unity"
2009,of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we see
2009,"in organic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of"
2009,"their habits of life. On my theory, unity of type is explained by unity"
2009,"of descent. The expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted"
2009,"on by the illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of"
2009,natural selection. For natural selection acts by either now adapting the
2009,varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions
2009,of life; or by having adapted them during past periods of time: the
2009,adaptations being aided in many cases by the increased use or disuse
2009,"of parts, being affected by the direct action of external conditions"
2009,"of life, and subjected in all cases to the several laws of growth and"
2009,"variation. Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the"
2009,"higher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former variations"
2009,"and adaptations, that of Unity of Type."

2009,CHAPTER VII. MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.
2009,
2009, Longevity--Modifications not necessarily simultaneous--Modifications
2009, apparently of no direct service--Progressive development--Characters of
2009," small functional importance, the most constant--Supposed incompetence"
2009, of natural selection to account for the incipient stages of useful
2009, structures--Causes which interfere with the acquisition through natural
2009, selection of useful structures--Gradations of structure with changed
2009," functions--Widely different organs in members of the same class,"
2009, developed from one and the same source--Reasons for disbelieving in
2009, great and abrupt modifications.
2009,
2009,
2009,I will devote this chapter to the consideration of various miscellaneous
2009,"objections which have been advanced against my views, as some of the"
2009,previous discussions may thus be made clearer; but it would be useless
2009,"to discuss all of them, as many have been made by writers who have not"
2009,taken the trouble to understand the subject. Thus a distinguished German
2009,"naturalist has asserted that the weakest part of my theory is, that I"
2009,"consider all organic beings as imperfect: what I have really said is,"
2009,that all are not as perfect as they might have been in relation to their
2009,conditions; and this is shown to be the case by so many native forms
2009,in many quarters of the world having yielded their places to intruding
2009,"foreigners. Nor can organic beings, even if they were at any one time"
2009,"perfectly adapted to their conditions of life, have remained so, when"
2009,"their conditions changed, unless they themselves likewise changed; and"
2009,"no one will dispute that the physical conditions of each country, as"
2009,"well as the number and kinds of its inhabitants, have undergone many"
2009,mutations.
2009,
2009,"A critic has lately insisted, with some parade of mathematical accuracy,"
2009,"that longevity is a great advantage to all species, so that he who"
2009,"believes in natural selection ""must arrange his genealogical tree"" in"
2009,such a manner that all the descendants have longer lives than their
2009,progenitors! Cannot our critics conceive that a biennial plant or one of
2009,the lower animals might range into a cold climate and perish there every
2009,"winter; and yet, owing to advantages gained through natural selection,"
2009,survive from year to year by means of its seeds or ova? Mr. E. Ray
2009,"Lankester has recently discussed this subject, and he concludes, as far"
2009,"as its extreme complexity allows him to form a judgment, that longevity"
2009,is generally related to the standard of each species in the scale of
2009,"organisation, as well as to the amount of expenditure in reproduction"
2009,"and in general activity. And these conditions have, it is probable, been"
2009,largely determined through natural selection.
2009,
2009,"It has been argued that, as none of the animals and plants of Egypt,"
2009,"of which we know anything, have changed during the last three or four"
2009,"thousand years, so probably have none in any part of the world. But, as"
2009,"Mr. G.H. Lewes has remarked, this line of argument proves too much,"
2009,"for the ancient domestic races figured on the Egyptian monuments, or"
2009,"embalmed, are closely similar or even identical with those now living;"
2009,yet all naturalists admit that such races have been produced through
2009,the modification of their original types. The many animals which have
2009,"remained unchanged since the commencement of the glacial period, would"
2009,"have been an incomparably stronger case, for these have been exposed"
2009,to great changes of climate and have migrated over great distances;
2009,"whereas, in Egypt, during the last several thousand years, the"
2009,"conditions of life, as far as we know, have remained absolutely uniform."
2009,The fact of little or no modification having been effected since the
2009,"glacial period, would have been of some avail against those who believe"
2009,"in an innate and necessary law of development, but is powerless against"
2009,"the doctrine of natural selection or the survival of the fittest, which"
2009,implies that when variations or individual differences of a beneficial
2009,"nature happen to arise, these will be preserved; but this will be"
2009,effected only under certain favourable circumstances.
2009,
2009,"The celebrated palaeontologist, Bronn, at the close of his German"
2009,"translation of this work, asks how, on the principle of natural"
2009,"selection, can a variety live side by side with the parent species?"
2009,If both have become fitted for slightly different habits of life
2009,"or conditions, they might live together; and if we lay on one side"
2009,"polymorphic species, in which the variability seems to be of a peculiar"
2009,"nature, and all mere temporary variations, such as size, albinism,"
2009,"etc., the more permanent varieties are generally found, as far as I can"
2009,"discover, inhabiting distinct stations, such as high land or low land,"
2009,"dry or moist districts. Moreover, in the case of animals which wander"
2009,"much about and cross freely, their varieties seem to be generally"
2009,confined to distinct regions.
2009,
2009,Bronn also insists that distinct species never differ from each other in
2009,"single characters, but in many parts; and he asks, how it always comes"
2009,that many parts of the organisation should have been modified at the
2009,same time through variation and natural selection? But there is no
2009,necessity for supposing that all the parts of any being have been
2009,"simultaneously modified. The most striking modifications, excellently"
2009,"adapted for some purpose, might, as was formerly remarked, be acquired"
2009,"by successive variations, if slight, first in one part and then in"
2009,"another; and as they would be transmitted all together, they would"
2009,appear to us as if they had been simultaneously developed. The best
2009,"answer, however, to the above objection is afforded by those domestic"
2009,"races which have been modified, chiefly through man's power of"
2009,"selection, for some special purpose. Look at the race and dray-horse, or"
2009,"at the greyhound and mastiff. Their whole frames, and even their mental"
2009,"characteristics, have been modified; but if we could trace each step"
2009,in the history of their transformation--and the latter steps can be
2009,"traced--we should not see great and simultaneous changes, but first"
2009,one part and then another slightly modified and improved. Even when
2009,selection has been applied by man to some one character alone--of which
2009,our cultivated plants offer the best instances--it will invariably be
2009,"found that although this one part, whether it be the flower, fruit, or"
2009,"leaves, has been greatly changed, almost all the other parts have been"
2009,slightly modified. This may be attributed partly to the principle of
2009,"correlated growth, and partly to so-called spontaneous variation."
2009,
2009,"A much more serious objection has been urged by Bronn, and recently by"
2009,"Broca, namely, that many characters appear to be of no service whatever"
2009,"to their possessors, and therefore cannot have been influenced through"
2009,natural selection. Bronn adduces the length of the ears and tails in the
2009,different species of hares and mice--the complex folds of enamel in the
2009,"teeth of many animals, and a multitude of analogous cases. With respect"
2009,"to plants, this subject has been discussed by Nageli in an admirable"
2009,"essay. He admits that natural selection has effected much, but he"
2009,insists that the families of plants differ chiefly from each other in
2009,"morphological characters, which appear to be quite unimportant for the"
2009,welfare of the species. He consequently believes in an innate tendency
2009,towards progressive and more perfect development. He specifies the
2009,"arrangement of the cells in the tissues, and of the leaves on the axis,"
2009,as cases in which natural selection could not have acted. To these
2009,"may be added the numerical divisions in the parts of the flower, the"
2009,"position of the ovules, the shape of the seed, when not of any use for"
2009,"dissemination, etc."
2009,
2009,"There is much force in the above objection. Nevertheless, we ought, in"
2009,"the first place, to be extremely cautious in pretending to decide what"
2009,"structures now are, or have formerly been, of use to each species. In"
2009,"the second place, it should always be borne in mind that when one part"
2009,"is modified, so will be other parts, through certain dimly seen causes,"
2009,"such as an increased or diminished flow of nutriment to a part, mutual"
2009,"pressure, an early developed part affecting one subsequently developed,"
2009,and so forth--as well as through other causes which lead to the
2009,"many mysterious cases of correlation, which we do not in the least"
2009,"understand. These agencies may be all grouped together, for the sake of"
2009,"brevity, under the expression of the laws of growth. In the third"
2009,"place, we have to allow for the direct and definite action of changed"
2009,"conditions of life, and for so-called spontaneous variations, in which"
2009,the nature of the conditions apparently plays a quite subordinate part.
2009,"Bud-variations, such as the appearance of a moss-rose on a common rose,"
2009,"or of a nectarine on a peach-tree, offer good instances of spontaneous"
2009,"variations; but even in these cases, if we bear in mind the power of a"
2009,"minute drop of poison in producing complex galls, we ought not to feel"
2009,too sure that the above variations are not the effect of some local
2009,"change in the nature of the sap, due to some change in the conditions."
2009,There must be some efficient cause for each slight individual
2009,"difference, as well as for more strongly marked variations which"
2009,"occasionally arise; and if the unknown cause were to act persistently,"
2009,it is almost certain that all the individuals of the species would be
2009,similarly modified.
2009,
2009,"In the earlier editions of this work I underrated, as it now seems"
2009,"probable, the frequency and importance of modifications due to"
2009,spontaneous variability. But it is impossible to attribute to this cause
2009,the innumerable structures which are so well adapted to the habits
2009,of life of each species. I can no more believe in this than that
2009,"the well-adapted form of a race-horse or greyhound, which before the"
2009,"principle of selection by man was well understood, excited so much"
2009,"surprise in the minds of the older naturalists, can thus be explained."
2009,
2009,It may be worth while to illustrate some of the foregoing remarks. With
2009,"respect to the assumed inutility of various parts and organs, it is"
2009,hardly necessary to observe that even in the higher and best-known
2009,"animals many structures exist, which are so highly developed that no one"
2009,"doubts that they are of importance, yet their use has not been, or has"
2009,"only recently been, ascertained. As Bronn gives the length of the ears"
2009,"and tail in the several species of mice as instances, though trifling"
2009,"ones, of differences in structure which can be of no special use, I may"
2009,"mention that, according to Dr. Schobl, the external ears of the common"
2009,"mouse are supplied in an extraordinary manner with nerves, so that"
2009,they no doubt serve as tactile organs; hence the length of the ears can
2009,"hardly be quite unimportant. We shall, also, presently see that the tail"
2009,is a highly useful prehensile organ to some of the species; and its use
2009,would be much influence by its length.
2009,
2009,"With respect to plants, to which on account of Nageli's essay I shall"
2009,"confine myself in the following remarks, it will be admitted that the"
2009,"flowers of the orchids present a multitude of curious structures,"
2009,which a few years ago would have been considered as mere morphological
2009,differences without any special function; but they are now known to be
2009,of the highest importance for the fertilisation of the species through
2009,"the aid of insects, and have probably been gained through natural"
2009,selection. No one until lately would have imagined that in dimorphic and
2009,"trimorphic plants the different lengths of the stamens and pistils, and"
2009,"their arrangement, could have been of any service, but now we know this"
2009,to be the case.
2009,
2009,"In certain whole groups of plants the ovules stand erect, and in others"
2009,"they are suspended; and within the same ovarium of some few plants, one"
2009,ovule holds the former and a second ovule the latter position. These
2009,"positions seem at first purely morphological, or of no physiological"
2009,signification; but Dr. Hooker informs me that within the same ovarium
2009,"the upper ovules alone in some cases, and in others the lower ones"
2009,alone are fertilised; and he suggests that this probably depends on
2009,"the direction in which the pollen-tubes enter the ovarium. If so, the"
2009,"position of the ovules, even when one is erect and the other suspended"
2009,"within the same ovarium, would follow the selection of any slight"
2009,"deviations in position which favoured their fertilisation, and the"
2009,production of seed.
2009,
2009,Several plants belonging to distinct orders habitually produce flowers
2009,"of two kinds--the one open, of the ordinary structure, the other closed"
2009,and imperfect. These two kinds of flowers sometimes differ wonderfully
2009,"in structure, yet may be seen to graduate into each other on the same"
2009,plant. The ordinary and open flowers can be intercrossed; and the
2009,benefits which certainly are derived from this process are thus secured.
2009,"The closed and imperfect flowers are, however, manifestly of high"
2009,"importance, as they yield with the utmost safety a large stock of seed,"
2009,with the expenditure of wonderfully little pollen. The two kinds of
2009,"flowers often differ much, as just stated, in structure. The petals in"
2009,"the imperfect flowers almost always consist of mere rudiments, and the"
2009,pollen-grains are reduced in diameter. In Ononis columnae five of the
2009,alternate stamens are rudimentary; and in some species of Viola three
2009,"stamens are in this state, two retaining their proper function, but"
2009,being of very small size. In six out of thirty of the closed flowers in
2009,"an Indian violet (name unknown, for the plants have never produced with"
2009,"me perfect flowers), the sepals are reduced from the normal number of"
2009,"five to three. In one section of the Malpighiaceae the closed flowers,"
2009,"according to A. de Jussieu, are still further modified, for the five"
2009,"stamens which stand opposite to the sepals are all aborted, a sixth"
2009,stamen standing opposite to a petal being alone developed; and this
2009,stamen is not present in the ordinary flowers of this species; the style
2009,is aborted; and the ovaria are reduced from three to two. Now although
2009,natural selection may well have had the power to prevent some of
2009,"the flowers from expanding, and to reduce the amount of pollen, when"
2009,"rendered by the closure of the flowers superfluous, yet hardly any of"
2009,"the above special modifications can have been thus determined, but"
2009,"must have followed from the laws of growth, including the functional"
2009,"inactivity of parts, during the progress of the reduction of the pollen"
2009,and the closure of the flowers.
2009,
2009,It is so necessary to appreciate the important effects of the laws of
2009,"growth, that I will give some additional cases of another kind, namely"
2009,"of differences in the same part or organ, due to differences in relative"
2009,"position on the same plant. In the Spanish chestnut, and in certain"
2009,"fir-trees, the angles of divergence of the leaves differ, according to"
2009,"Schacht, in the nearly horizontal and in the upright branches. In the"
2009,"common rue and some other plants, one flower, usually the central or"
2009,"terminal one, opens first, and has five sepals and petals, and five"
2009,divisions to the ovarium; while all the other flowers on the plant are
2009,tetramerous. In the British Adoxa the uppermost flower generally has
2009,"two calyx-lobes with the other organs tetramerous, while the surrounding"
2009,flowers generally have three calyx-lobes with the other organs
2009,pentamerous. In many Compositae and Umbelliferae (and in some other
2009,plants) the circumferential flowers have their corollas much more
2009,developed than those of the centre; and this seems often connected with
2009,"the abortion of the reproductive organs. It is a more curious fact,"
2009,"previously referred to, that the achenes or seeds of the circumference"
2009,"and centre sometimes differ greatly in form, colour and other"
2009,characters. In Carthamus and some other Compositae the central achenes
2009,alone are furnished with a pappus; and in Hyoseris the same head yields
2009,achenes of three different forms. In certain Umbelliferae the exterior
2009,"seeds, according to Tausch, are orthospermous, and the central one"
2009,"coelospermous, and this is a character which was considered by De"
2009,Candolle to be in other species of the highest systematic importance.
2009,"Professor Braun mentions a Fumariaceous genus, in which the flowers in"
2009,"the lower part of the spike bear oval, ribbed, one-seeded nutlets; and"
2009,"in the upper part of the spike, lanceolate, two-valved and two-seeded"
2009,"siliques. In these several cases, with the exception of that of the"
2009,"well-developed ray-florets, which are of service in making the flowers"
2009,"conspicuous to insects, natural selection cannot, as far as we can"
2009,"judge, have come into play, or only in a quite subordinate manner. All"
2009,these modifications follow from the relative position and inter-action
2009,of the parts; and it can hardly be doubted that if all the flowers and
2009,leaves on the same plant had been subjected to the same external and
2009,"internal condition, as are the flowers and leaves in certain positions,"
2009,all would have been modified in the same manner.
2009,
2009,"In numerous other cases we find modifications of structure, which are"
2009,"considered by botanists to be generally of a highly important nature,"
2009,"affecting only some of the flowers on the same plant, or occurring on"
2009,"distinct plants, which grow close together under the same conditions. As"
2009,"these variations seem of no special use to the plants, they cannot"
2009,have been influenced by natural selection. Of their cause we are quite
2009,"ignorant; we cannot even attribute them, as in the last class of cases,"
2009,"to any proximate agency, such as relative position. I will give only"
2009,"a few instances. It is so common to observe on the same plant, flowers"
2009,"indifferently tetramerous, pentamerous, etc., that I need not give"
2009,examples; but as numerical variations are comparatively rare when the
2009,"parts are few, I may mention that, according to De Candolle, the flowers"
2009,of Papaver bracteatum offer either two sepals with four petals (which
2009,"is the common type with poppies), or three sepals with six petals. The"
2009,manner in which the petals are folded in the bud is in most groups a
2009,very constant morphological character; but Professor Asa Gray states
2009,"that with some species of Mimulus, the aestivation is almost as"
2009,"frequently that of the Rhinanthideae as of the Antirrhinideae, to which"
2009,latter tribe the genus belongs. Aug. St. Hilaire gives the following
2009,cases: the genus Zanthoxylon belongs to a division of the Rutaceae with
2009,"a single ovary, but in some species flowers may be found on the same"
2009,"plant, and even in the same panicle, with either one or two ovaries."
2009,In Helianthemum the capsule has been described as unilocular or
2009,"tri-locular; and in H. mutabile, ""Une lame PLUS OU MOINS LARGE,"
2009,"s'etend entre le pericarpe et le placenta."" In the flowers of Saponaria"
2009,officinalis Dr. Masters has observed instances of both marginal and free
2009,"central placentation. Lastly, St. Hilaire found towards the southern"
2009,extreme of the range of Gomphia oleaeformis two forms which he did
2009,"not at first doubt were distinct species, but he subsequently saw them"
2009,"growing on the same bush; and he then adds, ""Voila donc dans un meme"
2009,individu des loges et un style qui se rattachent tantot a un axe
2009,"verticale et tantot a un gynobase."""
2009,
2009,We thus see that with plants many morphological changes may be
2009,"attributed to the laws of growth and the inter-action of parts,"
2009,independently of natural selection. But with respect to Nageli's
2009,doctrine of an innate tendency towards perfection or progressive
2009,"development, can it be said in the case of these strongly pronounced"
2009,"variations, that the plants have been caught in the act of progressing"
2009,"towards a higher state of development? On the contrary, I should infer"
2009,from the mere fact of the parts in question differing or varying greatly
2009,"on the same plant, that such modifications were of extremely small"
2009,"importance to the plants themselves, of whatever importance they may"
2009,generally be to us for our classifications. The acquisition of a useless
2009,part can hardly be said to raise an organism in the natural scale; and
2009,"in the case of the imperfect, closed flowers, above described, if any"
2009,"new principle has to be invoked, it must be one of retrogression rather"
2009,than of progression; and so it must be with many parasitic and degraded
2009,animals. We are ignorant of the exciting cause of the above specified
2009,modifications; but if the unknown cause were to act almost uniformly for
2009,"a length of time, we may infer that the result would be almost uniform;"
2009,and in this case all the individuals of the species would be modified in
2009,the same manner.
2009,
2009,From the fact of the above characters being unimportant for the welfare
2009,"of the species, any slight variations which occurred in them would"
2009,not have been accumulated and augmented through natural selection. A
2009,"structure which has been developed through long-continued selection,"
2009,"when it ceases to be of service to a species, generally becomes"
2009,"variable, as we see with rudimentary organs; for it will no longer be"
2009,"regulated by this same power of selection. But when, from the nature"
2009,"of the organism and of the conditions, modifications have been induced"
2009,"which are unimportant for the welfare of the species, they may be, and"
2009,"apparently often have been, transmitted in nearly the same state to"
2009,"numerous, otherwise modified, descendants. It cannot have been of much"
2009,"importance to the greater number of mammals, birds, or reptiles, whether"
2009,"they were clothed with hair, feathers or scales; yet hair has been"
2009,"transmitted to almost all mammals, feathers to all birds, and scales to"
2009,"all true reptiles. A structure, whatever it may be, which is common to"
2009,"many allied forms, is ranked by us as of high systematic importance,"
2009,and consequently is often assumed to be of high vital importance to the
2009,"species. Thus, as I am inclined to believe, morphological differences,"
2009,"which we consider as important--such as the arrangement of the leaves,"
2009,"the divisions of the flower or of the ovarium, the position of the"
2009,"ovules, etc., first appeared in many cases as fluctuating variations,"
2009,which sooner or later became constant through the nature of the organism
2009,"and of the surrounding conditions, as well as through the intercrossing"
2009,"of distinct individuals, but not through natural selection; for as these"
2009,"morphological characters do not affect the welfare of the species, any"
2009,slight deviations in them could not have been governed or accumulated
2009,through this latter agency. It is a strange result which we thus arrive
2009,"at, namely, that characters of slight vital importance to the species,"
2009,"are the most important to the systematist; but, as we shall hereafter"
2009,"see when we treat of the genetic principle of classification, this is by"
2009,no means so paradoxical as it may at first appear.
2009,
2009,Although we have no good evidence of the existence in organic beings of
2009,"an innate tendency towards progressive development, yet this necessarily"
2009,"follows, as I have attempted to show in the fourth chapter, through the"
2009,continued action of natural selection. For the best definition which
2009,"has ever been given of a high standard of organisation, is the degree"
2009,to which the parts have been specialised or differentiated; and natural
2009,"selection tends towards this end, inasmuch as the parts are thus enabled"
2009,to perform their functions more efficiently.
2009,
2009,"A distinguished zoologist, Mr. St. George Mivart, has recently collected"
2009,all the objections which have ever been advanced by myself and others
2009,"against the theory of natural selection, as propounded by Mr. Wallace"
2009,"and myself, and has illustrated them with admirable art and force. When"
2009,"thus marshalled, they make a formidable array; and as it forms no"
2009,part of Mr. Mivart's plan to give the various facts and considerations
2009,"opposed to his conclusions, no slight effort of reason and memory is"
2009,"left to the reader, who may wish to weigh the evidence on both sides."
2009,"When discussing special cases, Mr. Mivart passes over the effects of the"
2009,"increased use and disuse of parts, which I have always maintained to be"
2009,"highly important, and have treated in my ""Variation under Domestication"""
2009,"at greater length than, as I believe, any other writer. He likewise"
2009,"often assumes that I attribute nothing to variation, independently of"
2009,"natural selection, whereas in the work just referred to I have collected"
2009,a greater number of well-established cases than can be found in any
2009,"other work known to me. My judgment may not be trustworthy, but after"
2009,"reading with care Mr. Mivart's book, and comparing each section with"
2009,"what I have said on the same head, I never before felt so strongly"
2009,"convinced of the general truth of the conclusions here arrived at,"
2009,"subject, of course, in so intricate a subject, to much partial error."
2009,
2009,"All Mr. Mivart's objections will be, or have been, considered in the"
2009,present volume. The one new point which appears to have struck many
2009,"readers is, ""That natural selection is incompetent to account for the"
2009,"incipient stages of useful structures."" This subject is intimately"
2009,"connected with that of the gradation of the characters, often"
2009,"accompanied by a change of function, for instance, the conversion of a"
2009,"swim-bladder into lungs, points which were discussed in the last chapter"
2009,"under two headings. Nevertheless, I will here consider in some detail"
2009,"several of the cases advanced by Mr. Mivart, selecting those which are"
2009,"the most illustrative, as want of space prevents me from considering"
2009,all.
2009,
2009,"The giraffe, by its lofty stature, much elongated neck, fore legs, head"
2009,"and tongue, has its whole frame beautifully adapted for browsing on the"
2009,higher branches of trees. It can thus obtain food beyond the reach of
2009,the other Ungulata or hoofed animals inhabiting the same country; and
2009,this must be a great advantage to it during dearths. The Niata cattle
2009,"in South America show us how small a difference in structure may make,"
2009,"during such periods, a great difference in preserving an animal's"
2009,"life. These cattle can browse as well as others on grass, but from the"
2009,"projection of the lower jaw they cannot, during the often recurrent"
2009,"droughts, browse on the twigs of trees, reeds, etc., to which food the"
2009,common cattle and horses are then driven; so that at these times the
2009,"Niatas perish, if not fed by their owners. Before coming to Mr. Mivart's"
2009,"objections, it may be well to explain once again how natural selection"
2009,"will act in all ordinary cases. Man has modified some of his animals,"
2009,"without necessarily having attended to special points of structure, by"
2009,"simply preserving and breeding from the fleetest individuals, as with"
2009,"the race-horse and greyhound, or as with the game-cock, by breeding"
2009,"from the victorious birds. So under nature with the nascent giraffe, the"
2009,individuals which were the highest browsers and were able during dearths
2009,"to reach even an inch or two above the others, will often have been"
2009,preserved; for they will have roamed over the whole country in search of
2009,food. That the individuals of the same species often differ slightly
2009,in the relative lengths of all their parts may be seen in many works of
2009,"natural history, in which careful measurements are given. These slight"
2009,"proportional differences, due to the laws of growth and variation, are"
2009,not of the slightest use or importance to most species. But it will have
2009,"been otherwise with the nascent giraffe, considering its probable habits"
2009,of life; for those individuals which had some one part or several parts
2009,"of their bodies rather more elongated than usual, would generally"
2009,"have survived. These will have intercrossed and left offspring, either"
2009,"inheriting the same bodily peculiarities, or with a tendency to vary"
2009,again in the same manner; while the individuals less favoured in the
2009,same respects will have been the most liable to perish.
2009,
2009,"We here see that there is no need to separate single pairs, as man does,"
2009,when he methodically improves a breed: natural selection will preserve
2009,"and thus separate all the superior individuals, allowing them freely"
2009,"to intercross, and will destroy all the inferior individuals. By this"
2009,"process long-continued, which exactly corresponds with what I have"
2009,"called unconscious selection by man, combined, no doubt, in a most"
2009,important manner with the inherited effects of the increased use of
2009,"parts, it seems to me almost certain that an ordinary hoofed quadruped"
2009,might be converted into a giraffe.
2009,
2009,To this conclusion Mr. Mivart brings forward two objections. One is
2009,that the increased size of the body would obviously require an increased
2009,"supply of food, and he considers it as ""very problematical whether the"
2009,"disadvantages thence arising would not, in times of scarcity, more than"
2009,"counterbalance the advantages."" But as the giraffe does actually exist"
2009,"in large numbers in Africa, and as some of the largest antelopes in the"
2009,"world, taller than an ox, abound there, why should we doubt that, as"
2009,"far as size is concerned, intermediate gradations could formerly have"
2009,"existed there, subjected as now to severe dearths. Assuredly the being"
2009,"able to reach, at each stage of increased size, to a supply of food,"
2009,"left untouched by the other hoofed quadrupeds of the country, would have"
2009,been of some advantage to the nascent giraffe. Nor must we overlook the
2009,"fact, that increased bulk would act as a protection against almost all"
2009,"beasts of prey excepting the lion; and against this animal, its tall"
2009,"neck--and the taller the better--would, as Mr. Chauncey Wright has"
2009,"remarked, serve as a watch-tower. It is from this cause, as Sir S. Baker"
2009,"remarks, that no animal is more difficult to stalk than the giraffe."
2009,"This animal also uses its long neck as a means of offence or defence,"
2009,by violently swinging its head armed with stump-like horns. The
2009,preservation of each species can rarely be determined by any one
2009,"advantage, but by the union of all, great and small."
2009,
2009,"Mr. Mivart then asks (and this is his second objection), if natural"
2009,"selection be so potent, and if high browsing be so great an advantage,"
2009,why has not any other hoofed quadruped acquired a long neck and lofty
2009,"stature, besides the giraffe, and, in a lesser degree, the camel,"
2009,"guanaco and macrauchenia? Or, again, why has not any member of the"
2009,"group acquired a long proboscis? With respect to South Africa, which was"
2009,"formerly inhabited by numerous herds of the giraffe, the answer is not"
2009,"difficult, and can best be given by an illustration. In every meadow"
2009,"in England, in which trees grow, we see the lower branches trimmed or"
2009,planed to an exact level by the browsing of the horses or cattle; and
2009,"what advantage would it be, for instance, to sheep, if kept there, to"
2009,acquire slightly longer necks? In every district some one kind of animal
2009,will almost certainly be able to browse higher than the others; and it
2009,is almost equally certain that this one kind alone could have its neck
2009,"elongated for this purpose, through natural selection and the effects"
2009,of increased use. In South Africa the competition for browsing on the
2009,higher branches of the acacias and other trees must be between giraffe
2009,"and giraffe, and not with the other ungulate animals."
2009,
2009,"Why, in other quarters of the world, various animals belonging to this"
2009,"same order have not acquired either an elongated neck or a proboscis,"
2009,cannot be distinctly answered; but it is as unreasonable to expect a
2009,distinct answer to such a question as why some event in the history of
2009,mankind did not occur in one country while it did in another. We are
2009,ignorant with respect to the conditions which determine the numbers and
2009,"range of each species, and we cannot even conjecture what changes of"
2009,structure would be favourable to its increase in some new country. We
2009,"can, however, see in a general manner that various causes might have"
2009,interfered with the development of a long neck or proboscis. To reach
2009,"the foliage at a considerable height (without climbing, for which hoofed"
2009,animals are singularly ill-constructed) implies greatly increased
2009,bulk of body; and we know that some areas support singularly few large
2009,"quadrupeds, for instance South America, though it is so luxuriant,"
2009,while South Africa abounds with them to an unparalleled degree. Why this
2009,should be so we do not know; nor why the later tertiary periods should
2009,have been much more favourable for their existence than the present
2009,"time. Whatever the causes may have been, we can see that certain"
2009,districts and times would have been much more favourable than others for
2009,the development of so large a quadruped as the giraffe.
2009,
2009,In order that an animal should acquire some structure specially and
2009,"largely developed, it is almost indispensable that several other parts"
2009,should be modified and coadapted. Although every part of the body varies
2009,"slightly, it does not follow that the necessary parts should always"
2009,vary in the right direction and to the right degree. With the different
2009,species of our domesticated animals we know that the parts vary in
2009,"a different manner and degree, and that some species are much more"
2009,"variable than others. Even if the fitting variations did arise, it"
2009,does not follow that natural selection would be able to act on them and
2009,produce a structure which apparently would be beneficial to the species.
2009,"For instance, if the number of individuals existing in a country is"
2009,determined chiefly through destruction by beasts of prey--by external
2009,"or internal parasites, etc.--as seems often to be the case, then natural"
2009,"selection will be able to do little, or will be greatly retarded, in"
2009,"modifying any particular structure for obtaining food. Lastly, natural"
2009,"selection is a slow process, and the same favourable conditions must"
2009,long endure in order that any marked effect should thus be produced.
2009,"Except by assigning such general and vague reasons, we cannot explain"
2009,"why, in many quarters of the world, hoofed quadrupeds have not acquired"
2009,much elongated necks or other means for browsing on the higher branches
2009,of trees.
2009,
2009,Objections of the same nature as the foregoing have been advanced by
2009,"many writers. In each case various causes, besides the general ones just"
2009,"indicated, have probably interfered with the acquisition through natural"
2009,"selection of structures, which it is thought would be beneficial to"
2009,"certain species. One writer asks, why has not the ostrich acquired the"
2009,power of flight? But a moment's reflection will show what an enormous
2009,supply of food would be necessary to give to this bird of the desert
2009,force to move its huge body through the air. Oceanic islands are
2009,"inhabited by bats and seals, but by no terrestrial mammals; yet as some"
2009,"of these bats are peculiar species, they must have long inhabited their"
2009,"present homes. Therefore Sir C. Lyell asks, and assigns certain reasons"
2009,"in answer, why have not seals and bats given birth on such islands to"
2009,forms fitted to live on the land? But seals would necessarily be first
2009,"converted into terrestrial carnivorous animals of considerable size, and"
2009,bats into terrestrial insectivorous animals; for the former there would
2009,"be no prey; for the bats ground-insects would serve as food, but these"
2009,"would already be largely preyed on by the reptiles or birds, which first"
2009,"colonise and abound on most oceanic islands. Gradations of structure,"
2009,"with each stage beneficial to a changing species, will be favoured only"
2009,"under certain peculiar conditions. A strictly terrestrial animal, by"
2009,"occasionally hunting for food in shallow water, then in streams or"
2009,"lakes, might at last be converted into an animal so thoroughly aquatic"
2009,as to brave the open ocean. But seals would not find on oceanic
2009,islands the conditions favourable to their gradual reconversion into a
2009,"terrestrial form. Bats, as formerly shown, probably acquired their"
2009,"wings by at first gliding through the air from tree to tree, like the"
2009,"so-called flying squirrels, for the sake of escaping from their enemies,"
2009,or for avoiding falls; but when the power of true flight had once been
2009,"acquired, it would never be reconverted back, at least for the above"
2009,"purposes, into the less efficient power of gliding through the air."
2009,"Bats, might, indeed, like many birds, have had their wings greatly"
2009,"reduced in size, or completely lost, through disuse; but in this case"
2009,it would be necessary that they should first have acquired the power of
2009,"running quickly on the ground, by the aid of their hind legs alone, so"
2009,as to compete with birds or other ground animals; and for such a change
2009,a bat seems singularly ill-fitted. These conjectural remarks have been
2009,"made merely to show that a transition of structure, with each step"
2009,"beneficial, is a highly complex affair; and that there is nothing"
2009,strange in a transition not having occurred in any particular case.
2009,
2009,"Lastly, more than one writer has asked why have some animals had their"
2009,"mental powers more highly developed than others, as such development"
2009,would be advantageous to all? Why have not apes acquired the
2009,intellectual powers of man? Various causes could be assigned; but as
2009,"they are conjectural, and their relative probability cannot be weighed,"
2009,it would be useless to give them. A definite answer to the latter
2009,"question ought not to be expected, seeing that no one can solve the"
2009,"simpler problem, why, of two races of savages, one has risen higher in"
2009,the scale of civilisation than the other; and this apparently implies
2009,increased brain power.
2009,
2009,We will return to Mr. Mivart's other objections. Insects often resemble
2009,"for the sake of protection various objects, such as green or decayed"
2009,"leaves, dead twigs, bits of lichen, flowers, spines, excrement of birds,"
2009,and living insects; but to this latter point I shall hereafter recur.
2009,"The resemblance is often wonderfully close, and is not confined to"
2009,"colour, but extends to form, and even to the manner in which the insects"
2009,hold themselves. The caterpillars which project motionless like dead
2009,"twigs from the bushes on which they feed, offer an excellent instance of"
2009,a resemblance of this kind. The cases of the imitation of such objects
2009,"as the excrement of birds, are rare and exceptional. On this head,"
2009,"Mr. Mivart remarks, ""As, according to Mr. Darwin's theory, there is a"
2009,"constant tendency to indefinite variation, and as the minute incipient"
2009,"variations will be in ALL DIRECTIONS, they must tend to neutralize"
2009,"each other, and at first to form such unstable modifications that it is"
2009,"difficult, if not impossible, to see how such indefinite oscillations"
2009,of infinitesimal beginnings can ever build up a sufficiently appreciable
2009,"resemblance to a leaf, bamboo, or other object, for natural selection to"
2009,"seize upon and perpetuate."""
2009,
2009,But in all the foregoing cases the insects in their original state
2009,no doubt presented some rude and accidental resemblance to an object
2009,commonly found in the stations frequented by them. Nor is this at
2009,"all improbable, considering the almost infinite number of surrounding"
2009,objects and the diversity in form and colour of the hosts of insects
2009,"which exist. As some rude resemblance is necessary for the first start,"
2009,we can understand how it is that the larger and higher animals do not
2009,"(with the exception, as far as I know, of one fish) resemble for the"
2009,"sake of protection special objects, but only the surface which commonly"
2009,"surrounds them, and this chiefly in colour. Assuming that an insect"
2009,originally happened to resemble in some degree a dead twig or a decayed
2009,"leaf, and that it varied slightly in many ways, then all the variations"
2009,"which rendered the insect at all more like any such object, and thus"
2009,"favoured its escape, would be preserved, while other variations would"
2009,"be neglected and ultimately lost; or, if they rendered the insect at"
2009,"all less like the imitated object, they would be eliminated. There would"
2009,"indeed be force in Mr. Mivart's objection, if we were to attempt to"
2009,"account for the above resemblances, independently of natural selection,"
2009,through mere fluctuating variability; but as the case stands there is
2009,none.
2009,
2009,"Nor can I see any force in Mr. Mivart's difficulty with respect to ""the"
2009,"last touches of perfection in the mimicry;"" as in the case given by"
2009,"Mr. Wallace, of a walking-stick insect (Ceroxylus laceratus), which"
2009,"resembles ""a stick grown over by a creeping moss or jungermannia."""
2009,"So close was this resemblance, that a native Dyak maintained that the"
2009,foliaceous excrescences were really moss. Insects are preyed on by birds
2009,"and other enemies whose sight is probably sharper than ours, and"
2009,every grade in resemblance which aided an insect to escape notice or
2009,"detection, would tend towards its preservation; and the more perfect the"
2009,resemblance so much the better for the insect. Considering the nature
2009,of the differences between the species in the group which includes
2009,"the above Ceroxylus, there is nothing improbable in this insect having"
2009,"varied in the irregularities on its surface, and in these having become"
2009,more or less green-coloured; for in every group the characters which
2009,"differ in the several species are the most apt to vary, while the"
2009,"generic characters, or those common to all the species, are the most"
2009,constant.
2009,
2009,"The Greenland whale is one of the most wonderful animals in the world,"
2009,"and the baleen, or whalebone, one of its greatest peculiarities. The"
2009,"baleen consists of a row, on each side of the upper jaw, of about "
2009,"plates or laminae, which stand close together transversely to the longer"
2009,axis of the mouth. Within the main row there are some subsidiary rows.
2009,The extremities and inner margins of all the plates are frayed into
2009,"stiff bristles, which clothe the whole gigantic palate, and serve to"
2009,"strain or sift the water, and thus to secure the minute prey on which"
2009,these great animals subsist. The middle and longest lamina in the
2009,"Greenland whale is ten, twelve, or even fifteen feet in length; but in"
2009,the different species of Cetaceans there are gradations in length; the
2009,"middle lamina being in one species, according to Scoresby, four feet,"
2009,"in another three, in another eighteen inches, and in the Balaenoptera"
2009,rostrata only about nine inches in length. The quality of the whalebone
2009,also differs in the different species.
2009,
2009,"With respect to the baleen, Mr. Mivart remarks that if it ""had once"
2009,"attained such a size and development as to be at all useful, then"
2009,its preservation and augmentation within serviceable limits would be
2009,promoted by natural selection alone. But how to obtain the beginning of
2009,"such useful development?"" In answer, it may be asked, why should not"
2009,the early progenitors of the whales with baleen have possessed a mouth
2009,"constructed something like the lamellated beak of a duck? Ducks,"
2009,"like whales, subsist by sifting the mud and water; and the family has"
2009,"sometimes been called Criblatores, or sifters. I hope that I may not"
2009,be misconstrued into saying that the progenitors of whales did actually
2009,possess mouths lamellated like the beak of a duck. I wish only to show
2009,"that this is not incredible, and that the immense plates of baleen in"
2009,the Greenland whale might have been developed from such lamellae by
2009,"finely graduated steps, each of service to its possessor."
2009,
2009,The beak of a shoveller-duck (Spatula clypeata) is a more beautiful
2009,and complex structure than the mouth of a whale. The upper mandible is
2009,furnished on each side (in the specimen examined by me) with a row or
2009,"comb formed of  thin, elastic lamellae, obliquely bevelled so as to"
2009,"be pointed, and placed transversely to the longer axis of the mouth."
2009,"They arise from the palate, and are attached by flexible membrane to"
2009,the sides of the mandible. Those standing towards the middle are the
2009,"longest, being about one-third of an inch in length, and they project"
2009,fourteen one-hundredths of an inch beneath the edge. At their bases
2009,there is a short subsidiary row of obliquely transverse lamellae. In
2009,these several respects they resemble the plates of baleen in the mouth
2009,"of a whale. But towards the extremity of the beak they differ much, as"
2009,"they project inward, instead of straight downward. The entire head of"
2009,"the shoveller, though incomparably less bulky, is about one-eighteenth"
2009,"of the length of the head of a moderately large Balaenoptera rostrata,"
2009,in which species the baleen is only nine inches long; so that if we were
2009,"to make the head of the shoveller as long as that of the Balaenoptera,"
2009,"the lamellae would be six inches in length, that is, two-thirds of the"
2009,length of the baleen in this species of whale. The lower mandible of
2009,the shoveller-duck is furnished with lamellae of equal length with these
2009,"above, but finer; and in being thus furnished it differs conspicuously"
2009,"from the lower jaw of a whale, which is destitute of baleen. On the"
2009,"other hand, the extremities of these lower lamellae are frayed into"
2009,"fine bristly points, so that they thus curiously resemble the plates"
2009,"of baleen. In the genus Prion, a member of the distinct family of the"
2009,"Petrels, the upper mandible alone is furnished with lamellae, which are"
2009,well developed and project beneath the margin; so that the beak of this
2009,bird resembles in this respect the mouth of a whale.
2009,
2009,From the highly developed structure of the shoveller's beak we may
2009,proceed (as I have learned from information and specimens sent to me by
2009,"Mr. Salvin), without any great break, as far as fitness for sifting"
2009,"is concerned, through the beak of the Merganetta armata, and in some"
2009,"respects through that of the Aix sponsa, to the beak of the common"
2009,duck. In this latter species the lamellae are much coarser than in the
2009,"shoveller, and are firmly attached to the sides of the mandible; they"
2009,"are only about fifty in number on each side, and do not project at"
2009,"all beneath the margin. They are square-topped, and are edged with"
2009,"translucent, hardish tissue, as if for crushing food. The edges of the"
2009,"lower mandible are crossed by numerous fine ridges, which project very"
2009,little. Although the beak is thus very inferior as a sifter to that of
2009,"a shoveller, yet this bird, as every one knows, constantly uses it for"
2009,"this purpose. There are other species, as I hear from Mr. Salvin, in"
2009,which the lamellae are considerably less developed than in the common
2009,duck; but I do not know whether they use their beaks for sifting the
2009,water.
2009,
2009,Turning to another group of the same family. In the Egyptian goose
2009,(Chenalopex) the beak closely resembles that of the common duck; but the
2009,"lamellae are not so numerous, nor so distinct from each other, nor do"
2009,"they project so much inward; yet this goose, as I am informed by Mr. E."
2009,"Bartlett, ""uses its bill like a duck by throwing the water out at the"
2009,"corners."" Its chief food, however, is grass, which it crops like the"
2009,common goose. In this latter bird the lamellae of the upper mandible
2009,"are much coarser than in the common duck, almost confluent, about"
2009,"twenty-seven in number on each side, and terminating upward in"
2009,teeth-like knobs. The palate is also covered with hard rounded knobs.
2009,The edges of the lower mandible are serrated with teeth much more
2009,"prominent, coarser and sharper than in the duck. The common goose does"
2009,"not sift the water, but uses its beak exclusively for tearing or cutting"
2009,"herbage, for which purpose it is so well fitted that it can crop grass"
2009,"closer than almost any other animal. There are other species of geese,"
2009,"as I hear from Mr. Bartlett, in which the lamellae are less developed"
2009,than in the common goose.
2009,
2009,"We thus see that a member of the duck family, with a beak constructed"
2009,"like that of a common goose and adapted solely for grazing, or even"
2009,"a member with a beak having less well-developed lamellae, might be"
2009,converted by small changes into a species like the Egyptian goose--this
2009,"into one like the common duck--and, lastly, into one like the shoveller,"
2009,provided with a beak almost exclusively adapted for sifting the water;
2009,"for this bird could hardly use any part of its beak, except the hooked"
2009,"tip, for seizing or tearing solid food. The beak of a goose, as I may"
2009,"add, might also be converted by small changes into one provided with"
2009,"prominent, recurved teeth, like those of the Merganser (a member of the"
2009,"same family), serving for the widely different purpose of securing live"
2009,fish.
2009,
2009,Returning to the whales. The Hyperoodon bidens is destitute of true
2009,"teeth in an efficient condition, but its palate is roughened, according"
2009,"to Lacepede, with small unequal, hard points of horn. There is,"
2009,"therefore, nothing improbable in supposing that some early Cetacean form"
2009,"was provided with similar points of horn on the palate, but rather more"
2009,"regularly placed, and which, like the knobs on the beak of the goose,"
2009,"aided it in seizing or tearing its food. If so, it will hardly be denied"
2009,that the points might have been converted through variation and natural
2009,selection into lamellae as well-developed as those of the Egyptian
2009,"goose, in which case they would have been used both for seizing objects"
2009,and for sifting the water; then into lamellae like those of the domestic
2009,"duck; and so onward, until they became as well constructed as those of"
2009,"the shoveller, in which case they would have served exclusively as"
2009,"a sifting apparatus. From this stage, in which the lamellae would be"
2009,two-thirds of the length of the plates of baleen in the Balaenoptera
2009,"rostrata, gradations, which may be observed in still-existing Cetaceans,"
2009,lead us onward to the enormous plates of baleen in the Greenland whale.
2009,Nor is there the least reason to doubt that each step in this scale
2009,"might have been as serviceable to certain ancient Cetaceans, with"
2009,the functions of the parts slowly changing during the progress of
2009,"development, as are the gradations in the beaks of the different"
2009,existing members of the duck-family. We should bear in mind that each
2009,"species of duck is subjected to a severe struggle for existence, and"
2009,that the structure of every part of its frame must be well adapted to
2009,its conditions of life.
2009,
2009,"The Pleuronectidae, or Flat-fish, are remarkable for their asymmetrical"
2009,bodies. They rest on one side--in the greater number of species on the
2009,"left, but in some on the right side; and occasionally reversed adult"
2009,"specimens occur. The lower, or resting-surface, resembles at first sight"
2009,"the ventral surface of an ordinary fish; it is of a white colour, less"
2009,"developed in many ways than the upper side, with the lateral fins often"
2009,of smaller size. But the eyes offer the most remarkable peculiarity; for
2009,"they are both placed on the upper side of the head. During early youth,"
2009,"however, they stand opposite to each other, and the whole body is then"
2009,"symmetrical, with both sides equally coloured. Soon the eye proper to"
2009,the lower side begins to glide slowly round the head to the upper side;
2009,"but does not pass right through the skull, as was formerly thought to be"
2009,"the case. It is obvious that unless the lower eye did thus travel round,"
2009,it could not be used by the fish while lying in its habitual position on
2009,"one side. The lower eye would, also, have been liable to be abraded by"
2009,the sandy bottom. That the Pleuronectidae are admirably adapted by
2009,"their flattened and asymmetrical structure for their habits of life,"
2009,"is manifest from several species, such as soles, flounders, etc., being"
2009,extremely common. The chief advantages thus gained seem to be protection
2009,"from their enemies, and facility for feeding on the ground. The"
2009,"different members, however, of the family present, as Schiodte"
2009,"remarks, ""a long series of forms exhibiting a gradual transition from"
2009,"Hippoglossus pinguis, which does not in any considerable degree alter"
2009,"the shape in which it leaves the ovum, to the soles, which are entirely"
2009,"thrown to one side."""
2009,
2009,"Mr. Mivart has taken up this case, and remarks that a sudden spontaneous"
2009,"transformation in the position of the eyes is hardly conceivable, in"
2009,"which I quite agree with him. He then adds: ""If the transit was gradual,"
2009,then how such transit of one eye a minute fraction of the journey
2009,towards the other side of the head could benefit the individual
2009,"is, indeed, far from clear. It seems, even, that such an incipient"
2009,"transformation must rather have been injurious."" But he might have found"
2009,an answer to this objection in the excellent observations published
2009,"in  by Malm. The Pleuronectidae, while very young and still"
2009,"symmetrical, with their eyes standing on opposite sides of the head,"
2009,"cannot long retain a vertical position, owing to the excessive depth of"
2009,"their bodies, the small size of their lateral fins, and to their being"
2009,"destitute of a swim-bladder. Hence, soon growing tired, they fall to"
2009,"the bottom on one side. While thus at rest they often twist, as Malm"
2009,"observed, the lower eye upward, to see above them; and they do this so"
2009,vigorously that the eye is pressed hard against the upper part of the
2009,"orbit. The forehead between the eyes consequently becomes, as could be"
2009,"plainly seen, temporarily contracted in breadth. On one occasion Malm"
2009,saw a young fish raise and depress the lower eye through an angular
2009,distance of about seventy degrees.
2009,
2009,We should remember that the skull at this early age is cartilaginous and
2009,"flexible, so that it readily yields to muscular action. It is also known"
2009,"with the higher animals, even after early youth, that the skull"
2009,"yields and is altered in shape, if the skin or muscles be permanently"
2009,"contracted through disease or some accident. With long-eared rabbits,"
2009,"if one ear flops forward and downward, its weight drags forward all the"
2009,"bones of the skull on the same side, of which I have given a figure."
2009,"Malm states that the newly-hatched young of perches, salmon, and several"
2009,"other symmetrical fishes, have the habit of occasionally resting on"
2009,one side at the bottom; and he has observed that they often then
2009,strain their lower eyes so as to look upward; and their skulls are thus
2009,"rendered rather crooked. These fishes, however, are soon able to hold"
2009,"themselves in a vertical position, and no permanent effect is thus"
2009,"produced. With the Pleuronectidae, on the other hand, the older they"
2009,"grow the more habitually they rest on one side, owing to the increasing"
2009,"flatness of their bodies, and a permanent effect is thus produced on the"
2009,"form of the head, and on the position of the eyes. Judging from analogy,"
2009,the tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through the
2009,"principle of inheritance. Schiodte believes, in opposition to some other"
2009,"naturalists, that the Pleuronectidae are not quite symmetrical even"
2009,"in the embryo; and if this be so, we could understand how it is that"
2009,"certain species, while young, habitually fall over and rest on the left"
2009,"side, and other species on the right side. Malm adds, in confirmation"
2009,"of the above view, that the adult Trachypterus arcticus, which is not a"
2009,"member of the Pleuronectidae, rests on its left side at the bottom, and"
2009,"swims diagonally through the water; and in this fish, the two sides"
2009,of the head are said to be somewhat dissimilar. Our great authority
2009,"on Fishes, Dr. Gunther, concludes his abstract of Malm's paper, by"
2009,"remarking that ""the author gives a very simple explanation of the"
2009,"abnormal condition of the Pleuronectoids."""
2009,
2009,We thus see that the first stages of the transit of the eye from one
2009,"side of the head to the other, which Mr. Mivart considers would be"
2009,"injurious, may be attributed to the habit, no doubt beneficial to the"
2009,"individual and to the species, of endeavouring to look upward with both"
2009,"eyes, while resting on one side at the bottom. We may also attribute to"
2009,the inherited effects of use the fact of the mouth in several kinds
2009,"of flat-fish being bent towards the lower surface, with the jaw bones"
2009,"stronger and more effective on this, the eyeless side of the head, than"
2009,"on the other, for the sake, as Dr. Traquair supposes, of feeding with"
2009,"ease on the ground. Disuse, on the other hand, will account for the less"
2009,"developed condition of the whole inferior half of the body, including"
2009,the lateral fins; though Yarrel thinks that the reduced size of these
2009,"fins is advantageous to the fish, as ""there is so much less room for"
2009,"their action than with the larger fins above."" Perhaps the lesser number"
2009,of teeth in the proportion of four to seven in the upper halves of the
2009,"two jaws of the plaice, to twenty-five to thirty in the lower halves,"
2009,may likewise be accounted for by disuse. From the colourless state of
2009,"the ventral surface of most fishes and of many other animals, we may"
2009,"reasonably suppose that the absence of colour in flat-fish on the side,"
2009,"whether it be the right or left, which is under-most, is due to the"
2009,exclusion of light. But it cannot be supposed that the peculiar speckled
2009,"appearance of the upper side of the sole, so like the sandy bed of the"
2009,"sea, or the power in some species, as recently shown by Pouchet, of"
2009,"changing their colour in accordance with the surrounding surface, or the"
2009,"presence of bony tubercles on the upper side of the turbot, are due to"
2009,the action of the light. Here natural selection has probably come into
2009,"play, as well as in adapting the general shape of the body of these"
2009,"fishes, and many other peculiarities, to their habits of life. We should"
2009,"keep in mind, as I have before insisted, that the inherited effects"
2009,"of the increased use of parts, and perhaps of their disuse, will be"
2009,strengthened by natural selection. For all spontaneous variations in the
2009,right direction will thus be preserved; as will those individuals
2009,which inherit in the highest degree the effects of the increased and
2009,beneficial use of any part. How much to attribute in each particular
2009,"case to the effects of use, and how much to natural selection, it seems"
2009,impossible to decide.
2009,
2009,I may give another instance of a structure which apparently owes its
2009,origin exclusively to use or habit. The extremity of the tail in
2009,some American monkeys has been converted into a wonderfully perfect
2009,"prehensile organ, and serves as a fifth hand. A reviewer, who agrees"
2009,"with Mr. Mivart in every detail, remarks on this structure: ""It is"
2009,impossible to believe that in any number of ages the first slight
2009,incipient tendency to grasp could preserve the lives of the individuals
2009,"possessing it, or favour their chance of having and of rearing"
2009,"offspring."" But there is no necessity for any such belief. Habit, and"
2009,"this almost implies that some benefit great or small is thus derived,"
2009,would in all probability suffice for the work. Brehm saw the young of
2009,an African monkey (Cercopithecus) clinging to the under surface of their
2009,"mother by their hands, and at the same time they hooked their little"
2009,tails round that of their mother. Professor Henslow kept in confinement
2009,some harvest mice (Mus messorius) which do not possess a structurally
2009,prehensive tail; but he frequently observed that they curled their
2009,"tails round the branches of a bush placed in the cage, and thus aided"
2009,themselves in climbing. I have received an analogous account from Dr.
2009,"Gunther, who has seen a mouse thus suspend itself. If the harvest mouse"
2009,"had been more strictly arboreal, it would perhaps have had its tail"
2009,"rendered structurally prehensile, as is the case with some members of"
2009,"the same order. Why Cercopithecus, considering its habits while young,"
2009,"has not become thus provided, it would be difficult to say. It is,"
2009,"however, possible that the long tail of this monkey may be of more"
2009,"service to it as a balancing organ in making its prodigious leaps, than"
2009,as a prehensile organ.
2009,
2009,"The mammary glands are common to the whole class of mammals, and are"
2009,"indispensable for their existence; they must, therefore, have been"
2009,"developed at an extremely remote period, and we can know nothing"
2009,"positively about their manner of development. Mr. Mivart asks: ""Is it"
2009,conceivable that the young of any animal was ever saved from destruction
2009,by accidentally sucking a drop of scarcely nutritious fluid from an
2009,accidentally hypertrophied cutaneous gland of its mother? And even
2009,"if one was so, what chance was there of the perpetuation of such a"
2009,"variation?"" But the case is not here put fairly. It is admitted by most"
2009,evolutionists that mammals are descended from a marsupial form; and
2009,"if so, the mammary glands will have been at first developed within"
2009,the marsupial sack. In the case of the fish (Hippocampus) the eggs are
2009,"hatched, and the young are reared for a time, within a sack of this"
2009,"nature; and an American naturalist, Mr. Lockwood, believes from what he"
2009,"has seen of the development of the young, that they are nourished by"
2009,"a secretion from the cutaneous glands of the sack. Now, with the"
2009,"early progenitors of mammals, almost before they deserved to be thus"
2009,"designated, is it not at least possible that the young might have been"
2009,"similarly nourished? And in this case, the individuals which secreted a"
2009,"fluid, in some degree or manner the most nutritious, so as to partake of"
2009,"the nature of milk, would in the long run have reared a larger number"
2009,"of well-nourished offspring, than would the individuals which secreted a"
2009,"poorer fluid; and thus the cutaneous glands, which are the homologues of"
2009,"the mammary glands, would have been improved or rendered more effective."
2009,"It accords with the widely extended principle of specialisation, that"
2009,the glands over a certain space of the sack should have become more
2009,highly developed than the remainder; and they would then have formed a
2009,"breast, but at first without a nipple, as we see in the Ornithorhyncus,"
2009,at the base of the mammalian series. Through what agency the glands over
2009,"a certain space became more highly specialised than the others, I will"
2009,"not pretend to decide, whether in part through compensation of growth,"
2009,"the effects of use, or of natural selection."
2009,
2009,"The development of the mammary glands would have been of no service, and"
2009,"could not have been affected through natural selection, unless the young"
2009,at the same time were able to partake of the secretion. There is no
2009,greater difficulty in understanding how young mammals have instinctively
2009,"learned to suck the breast, than in understanding how unhatched chickens"
2009,have learned to break the egg-shell by tapping against it with their
2009,specially adapted beaks; or how a few hours after leaving the shell they
2009,have learned to pick up grains of food. In such cases the most probable
2009,"solution seems to be, that the habit was at first acquired by practice"
2009,"at a more advanced age, and afterwards transmitted to the offspring"
2009,"at an earlier age. But the young kangaroo is said not to suck, only to"
2009,"cling to the nipple of its mother, who has the power of injecting milk"
2009,"into the mouth of her helpless, half-formed offspring. On this head"
2009,"Mr. Mivart remarks: ""Did no special provision exist, the young one must"
2009,infallibly be choked by the intrusion of the milk into the wind-pipe.
2009,But there IS a special provision. The larynx is so elongated that
2009,"it rises up into the posterior end of the nasal passage, and is thus"
2009,"enabled to give free entrance to the air for the lungs, while the milk"
2009,"passes harmlessly on each side of this elongated larynx, and so safely"
2009,"attains the gullet behind it."" Mr. Mivart then asks how did natural"
2009,"selection remove in the adult kangaroo (and in most other mammals, on"
2009,"the assumption that they are descended from a marsupial form), ""this at"
2009,"least perfectly innocent and harmless structure?"" It may be suggested"
2009,"in answer that the voice, which is certainly of high importance to many"
2009,"animals, could hardly have been used with full force as long as the"
2009,larynx entered the nasal passage; and Professor Flower has suggested
2009,to me that this structure would have greatly interfered with an animal
2009,swallowing solid food.
2009,
2009,We will now turn for a short space to the lower divisions of the
2009,"animal kingdom. The Echinodermata (star-fishes, sea-urchins, etc.) are"
2009,"furnished with remarkable organs, called pedicellariae, which consist,"
2009,"when well developed, of a tridactyle forceps--that is, of one formed of"
2009,"three serrated arms, neatly fitting together and placed on the summit of"
2009,"a flexible stem, moved by muscles. These forceps can seize firmly hold"
2009,of any object; and Alexander Agassiz has seen an Echinus or sea-urchin
2009,rapidly passing particles of excrement from forceps to forceps down
2009,"certain lines of its body, in order that its shell should not be fouled."
2009,"But there is no doubt that besides removing dirt of all kinds, they"
2009,subserve other functions; and one of these apparently is defence.
2009,
2009,"With respect to these organs, Mr. Mivart, as on so many previous"
2009,"occasions, asks: ""What would be the utility of the FIRST RUDIMENTARY"
2009,"BEGINNINGS of such structures, and how could such insipient buddings"
2009,"have ever preserved the life of a single Echinus?"" He adds, ""not even"
2009,the SUDDEN development of the snapping action would have been beneficial
2009,"without the freely movable stalk, nor could the latter have been"
2009,"efficient without the snapping jaws, yet no minute, nearly indefinite"
2009,variations could simultaneously evolve these complex co-ordinations of
2009,structure; to deny this seems to do no less than to affirm a startling
2009,"paradox."" Paradoxical as this may appear to Mr. Mivart, tridactyle"
2009,"forcepses, immovably fixed at the base, but capable of a snapping"
2009,"action, certainly exist on some star-fishes; and this is intelligible"
2009,"if they serve, at least in part, as a means of defence. Mr. Agassiz, to"
2009,"whose great kindness I am indebted for much information on the subject,"
2009,"informs me that there are other star-fishes, in which one of the three"
2009,arms of the forceps is reduced to a support for the other two; and
2009,"again, other genera in which the third arm is completely lost. In"
2009,"Echinoneus, the shell is described by M. Perrier as bearing two kinds of"
2009,"pedicellariae, one resembling those of Echinus, and the other those of"
2009,Spatangus; and such cases are always interesting as affording the means
2009,"of apparently sudden transitions, through the abortion of one of the two"
2009,states of an organ.
2009,
2009,With respect to the steps by which these curious organs have been
2009,"evolved, Mr. Agassiz infers from his own researches and those of Mr."
2009,"Muller, that both in star-fishes and sea-urchins the pedicellariae must"
2009,undoubtedly be looked at as modified spines. This may be inferred from
2009,"their manner of development in the individual, as well as from a long"
2009,"and perfect series of gradations in different species and genera, from"
2009,"simple granules to ordinary spines, to perfect tridactyle pedicellariae."
2009,The gradation extends even to the manner in which ordinary spines
2009,"and the pedicellariae, with their supporting calcareous rods, are"
2009,"articulated to the shell. In certain genera of star-fishes, ""the very"
2009,combinations needed to show that the pedicellariae are only modified
2009,"branching spines"" may be found. Thus we have fixed spines, with three"
2009,"equi-distant, serrated, movable branches, articulated to near their"
2009,"bases; and higher up, on the same spine, three other movable branches."
2009,"Now when the latter arise from the summit of a spine they form, in fact,"
2009,"a rude tridactyle pedicellariae, and such may be seen on the same spine"
2009,together with the three lower branches. In this case the identity in
2009,nature between the arms of the pedicellariae and the movable branches
2009,"of a spine, is unmistakable. It is generally admitted that the ordinary"
2009,"spines serve as a protection; and if so, there can be no reason to doubt"
2009,that those furnished with serrated and movable branches likewise serve
2009,for the same purpose; and they would thus serve still more effectively
2009,as soon as by meeting together they acted as a prehensile or snapping
2009,"apparatus. Thus every gradation, from an ordinary fixed spine to a fixed"
2009,"pedicellariae, would be of service."
2009,
2009,"In certain genera of star-fishes these organs, instead of being fixed"
2009,"or borne on an immovable support, are placed on the summit of a flexible"
2009,"and muscular, though short, stem; and in this case they probably"
2009,subserve some additional function besides defence. In the sea-urchins
2009,the steps can be followed by which a fixed spine becomes articulated to
2009,"the shell, and is thus rendered movable. I wish I had space here to"
2009,give a fuller abstract of Mr. Agassiz's interesting observations on the
2009,"development of the pedicellariae. All possible gradations, as he adds,"
2009,may likewise be found between the pedicellariae of the star-fishes and
2009,"the hooks of the Ophiurians, another group of the Echinodermata; and"
2009,again between the pedicellariae of sea-urchins and the anchors of the
2009,"Holothuriae, also belonging to the same great class."
2009,
2009,"Certain compound animals, or zoophytes, as they have been termed, namely"
2009,"the Polyzoa, are provided with curious organs called avicularia. These"
2009,differ much in structure in the different species. In their most perfect
2009,condition they curiously resemble the head and beak of a vulture in
2009,"miniature, seated on a neck and capable of movement, as is likewise the"
2009,"lower jaw or mandible. In one species observed by me, all the avicularia"
2009,"on the same branch often moved simultaneously backwards and forwards,"
2009,"with the lower jaw widely open, through an angle of about  degrees,"
2009,in the course of five seconds; and their movement caused the whole
2009,polyzoary to tremble. When the jaws are touched with a needle they seize
2009,it so firmly that the branch can thus be shaken.
2009,
2009,"Mr. Mivart adduces this case, chiefly on account of the supposed"
2009,"difficulty of organs, namely the avicularia of the Polyzoa and the"
2009,"pedicellariae of the Echinodermata, which he considers as ""essentially"
2009,"similar,"" having been developed through natural selection in widely"
2009,"distinct divisions of the animal kingdom. But, as far as structure is"
2009,"concerned, I can see no similarity between tridactyle pedicellariae and"
2009,avicularia. The latter resembles somewhat more closely the chelae or
2009,pincers of Crustaceans; and Mr. Mivart might have adduced with equal
2009,"appropriateness this resemblance as a special difficulty, or even their"
2009,resemblance to the head and beak of a bird. The avicularia are believed
2009,"by Mr. Busk, Dr. Smitt and Dr. Nitsche--naturalists who have carefully"
2009,studied this group--to be homologous with the zooids and their
2009,"cells which compose the zoophyte, the movable lip or lid of the cell"
2009,corresponding with the lower and movable mandible of the avicularium.
2009,"Mr. Busk, however, does not know of any gradations now existing between"
2009,a zooid and an avicularium. It is therefore impossible to conjecture by
2009,what serviceable gradations the one could have been converted into the
2009,"other, but it by no means follows from this that such gradations have"
2009,not existed.
2009,
2009,As the chelae of Crustaceans resemble in some degree the avicularia of
2009,"Polyzoa, both serving as pincers, it may be worth while to show that"
2009,with the former a long series of serviceable gradations still exists. In
2009,"the first and simplest stage, the terminal segment of a limb shuts down"
2009,"either on the square summit of the broad penultimate segment, or against"
2009,"one whole side, and is thus enabled to catch hold of an object, but the"
2009,limb still serves as an organ of locomotion. We next find one corner of
2009,"the broad penultimate segment slightly prominent, sometimes furnished"
2009,"with irregular teeth, and against these the terminal segment shuts down."
2009,"By an increase in the size of this projection, with its shape, as well"
2009,"as that of the terminal segment, slightly modified and improved, the"
2009,"pincers are rendered more and more perfect, until we have at last"
2009,an instrument as efficient as the chelae of a lobster. And all these
2009,gradations can be actually traced.
2009,
2009,"Besides the avicularia, the polyzoa possess curious organs called"
2009,"vibracula. These generally consist of long bristles, capable of movement"
2009,and easily excited. In one species examined by me the vibracula were
2009,"slightly curved and serrated along the outer margin, and all of them on"
2009,"the same polyzoary often moved simultaneously; so that, acting like"
2009,"long oars, they swept a branch rapidly across the object-glass of my"
2009,"microscope. When a branch was placed on its face, the vibracula became"
2009,"entangled, and they made violent efforts to free themselves. They are"
2009,"supposed to serve as a defence, and may be seen, as Mr. Busk remarks,"
2009,"""to sweep slowly and carefully over the surface of the polyzoary,"
2009,removing what might be noxious to the delicate inhabitants of the cells
2009,"when their tentacula are protruded."" The avicularia, like the vibracula,"
2009,"probably serve for defence, but they also catch and kill small living"
2009,"animals, which, it is believed, are afterwards swept by the currents"
2009,within reach of the tentacula of the zooids. Some species are provided
2009,"with avicularia and vibracula, some with avicularia alone and a few with"
2009,vibracula alone.
2009,
2009,It is not easy to imagine two objects more widely different in
2009,"appearance than a bristle or vibraculum, and an avicularium like the"
2009,head of a bird; yet they are almost certainly homologous and have been
2009,"developed from the same common source, namely a zooid with its cell."
2009,"Hence, we can understand how it is that these organs graduate in some"
2009,"cases, as I am informed by Mr. Busk, into each other. Thus, with the"
2009,"avicularia of several species of Lepralia, the movable mandible is so"
2009,much produced and is so like a bristle that the presence of the upper
2009,or fixed beak alone serves to determine its avicularian nature. The
2009,"vibracula may have been directly developed from the lips of the cells,"
2009,without having passed through the avicularian stage; but it seems more
2009,"probable that they have passed through this stage, as during the early"
2009,"stages of the transformation, the other parts of the cell, with the"
2009,"included zooid, could hardly have disappeared at once. In many cases the"
2009,"vibracula have a grooved support at the base, which seems to represent"
2009,the fixed beak; though this support in some species is quite absent.
2009,"This view of the development of the vibracula, if trustworthy, is"
2009,interesting; for supposing that all the species provided with avicularia
2009,"had become extinct, no one with the most vivid imagination would ever"
2009,have thought that the vibracula had originally existed as part of an
2009,"organ, resembling a bird's head, or an irregular box or hood. It is"
2009,interesting to see two such widely different organs developed from a
2009,common origin; and as the movable lip of the cell serves as a protection
2009,"to the zooid, there is no difficulty in believing that all the"
2009,"gradations, by which the lip became converted first into the lower"
2009,"mandible of an avicularium, and then into an elongated bristle,"
2009,likewise served as a protection in different ways and under different
2009,circumstances.
2009,
2009,"In the vegetable kingdom Mr. Mivart only alludes to two cases, namely"
2009,"the structure of the flowers of orchids, and the movements of climbing"
2009,"plants. With respect to the former, he says: ""The explanation of their"
2009,ORIGIN is deemed thoroughly unsatisfactory--utterly insufficient to
2009,"explain the incipient, infinitesimal beginnings of structures which are"
2009,"of utility only when they are considerably developed."" As I have fully"
2009,"treated this subject in another work, I will here give only a few"
2009,details on one alone of the most striking peculiarities of the flowers
2009,"of orchids, namely, their pollinia. A pollinium, when highly developed,"
2009,"consists of a mass of pollen-grains, affixed to an elastic foot-stalk"
2009,"or caudicle, and this to a little mass of extremely viscid matter. The"
2009,pollinia are by this means transported by insects from one flower to
2009,the stigma of another. In some orchids there is no caudicle to the
2009,"pollen-masses, and the grains are merely tied together by fine threads;"
2009,"but as these are not confined to orchids, they need not here be"
2009,considered; yet I may mention that at the base of the orchidaceous
2009,"series, in Cypripedium, we can see how the threads were probably"
2009,first developed. In other orchids the threads cohere at one end of the
2009,pollen-masses; and this forms the first or nascent trace of a caudicle.
2009,"That this is the origin of the caudicle, even when of considerable"
2009,"length and highly developed, we have good evidence in the aborted"
2009,pollen-grains which can sometimes be detected embedded within the
2009,central and solid parts.
2009,
2009,"With respect to the second chief peculiarity, namely, the little mass"
2009,"of viscid matter attached to the end of the caudicle, a long series of"
2009,"gradations can be specified, each of plain service to the plant. In most"
2009,flowers belonging to other orders the stigma secretes a little viscid
2009,"matter. Now, in certain orchids similar viscid matter is secreted, but"
2009,in much larger quantities by one alone of the three stigmas; and this
2009,"stigma, perhaps in consequence of the copious secretion, is rendered"
2009,"sterile. When an insect visits a flower of this kind, it rubs off some"
2009,"of the viscid matter, and thus at the same time drags away some of the"
2009,"pollen-grains. From this simple condition, which differs but"
2009,"little from that of a multitude of common flowers, there are endless"
2009,gradations--to species in which the pollen-mass terminates in a very
2009,"short, free caudicle--to others in which the caudicle becomes firmly"
2009,"attached to the viscid matter, with the sterile stigma itself much"
2009,modified. In this latter case we have a pollinium in its most highly
2009,developed and perfect condition. He who will carefully examine the
2009,flowers of orchids for himself will not deny the existence of the above
2009,series of gradations--from a mass of pollen-grains merely tied together
2009,"by threads, with the stigma differing but little from that of the"
2009,"ordinary flowers, to a highly complex pollinium, admirably adapted for"
2009,transportal by insects; nor will he deny that all the gradations in
2009,the several species are admirably adapted in relation to the general
2009,structure of each flower for its fertilisation by different insects. In
2009,"this, and in almost every other case, the enquiry may be pushed further"
2009,backwards; and it may be asked how did the stigma of an ordinary flower
2009,"become viscid, but as we do not know the full history of any one"
2009,"group of beings, it is as useless to ask, as it is hopeless to attempt"
2009,"answering, such questions."
2009,
2009,We will now turn to climbing plants. These can be arranged in a long
2009,"series, from those which simply twine round a support, to those which I"
2009,"have called leaf-climbers, and to those provided with tendrils. In these"
2009,"two latter classes the stems have generally, but not always, lost the"
2009,"power of twining, though they retain the power of revolving, which the"
2009,tendrils likewise possess. The gradations from leaf-climbers to tendril
2009,"bearers are wonderfully close, and certain plants may be differently"
2009,placed in either class. But in ascending the series from simple twiners
2009,"to leaf-climbers, an important quality is added, namely sensitiveness"
2009,"to a touch, by which means the foot-stalks of the leaves or flowers, or"
2009,"these modified and converted into tendrils, are excited to bend round"
2009,and clasp the touching object. He who will read my memoir on these
2009,"plants will, I think, admit that all the many gradations in function and"
2009,structure between simple twiners and tendril-bearers are in each case
2009,"beneficial in a high degree to the species. For instance, it is clearly"
2009,a great advantage to a twining plant to become a leaf-climber; and it is
2009,probable that every twiner which possessed leaves with long foot-stalks
2009,"would have been developed into a leaf-climber, if the foot-stalks had"
2009,possessed in any slight degree the requisite sensitiveness to a touch.
2009,
2009,"As twining is the simplest means of ascending a support, and forms the"
2009,"basis of our series, it may naturally be asked how did plants acquire"
2009,"this power in an incipient degree, afterwards to be improved and"
2009,"increased through natural selection. The power of twining depends,"
2009,"firstly, on the stems while young being extremely flexible (but this"
2009,"is a character common to many plants which are not climbers); and,"
2009,"secondly, on their continually bending to all points of the compass, one"
2009,"after the other in succession, in the same order. By this movement the"
2009,"stems are inclined to all sides, and are made to move round and round."
2009,As soon as the lower part of a stem strikes against any object and is
2009,"stopped, the upper part still goes on bending and revolving, and thus"
2009,necessarily twines round and up the support. The revolving movement
2009,ceases after the early growth of each shoot. As in many widely separated
2009,"families of plants, single species and single genera possess the power"
2009,"of revolving, and have thus become twiners, they must have independently"
2009,"acquired it, and cannot have inherited it from a common progenitor."
2009,"Hence, I was led to predict that some slight tendency to a movement of"
2009,this kind would be found to be far from uncommon with plants which did
2009,not climb; and that this had afforded the basis for natural selection
2009,"to work on and improve. When I made this prediction, I knew of only one"
2009,"imperfect case, namely, of the young flower-peduncles of a Maurandia"
2009,"which revolved slightly and irregularly, like the stems of twining"
2009,"plants, but without making any use of this habit. Soon afterwards"
2009,Fritz Muller discovered that the young stems of an Alisma and of a
2009,Linum--plants which do not climb and are widely separated in the natural
2009,"system--revolved plainly, though irregularly, and he states that he has"
2009,reason to suspect that this occurs with some other plants. These slight
2009,"movements appear to be of no service to the plants in question; anyhow,"
2009,"they are not of the least use in the way of climbing, which is the point"
2009,that concerns us. Nevertheless we can see that if the stems of these
2009,"plants had been flexible, and if under the conditions to which they are"
2009,"exposed it had profited them to ascend to a height, then the habit"
2009,of slightly and irregularly revolving might have been increased and
2009,"utilised through natural selection, until they had become converted into"
2009,well-developed twining species.
2009,
2009,With respect to the sensitiveness of the foot-stalks of the leaves and
2009,"flowers, and of tendrils, nearly the same remarks are applicable as in"
2009,the case of the revolving movements of twining plants. As a vast number
2009,"of species, belonging to widely distinct groups, are endowed with this"
2009,"kind of sensitiveness, it ought to be found in a nascent condition in"
2009,many plants which have not become climbers. This is the case: I observed
2009,that the young flower-peduncles of the above Maurandia curved themselves
2009,a little towards the side which was touched. Morren found in several
2009,"species of Oxalis that the leaves and their foot-stalks moved,"
2009,"especially after exposure to a hot sun, when they were gently and"
2009,"repeatedly touched, or when the plant was shaken. I repeated these"
2009,observations on some other species of Oxalis with the same result; in
2009,"some of them the movement was distinct, but was best seen in the young"
2009,leaves; in others it was extremely slight. It is a more important fact
2009,"that according to the high authority of Hofmeister, the young shoots and"
2009,leaves of all plants move after being shaken; and with climbing plants
2009,"it is, as we know, only during the early stages of growth that the"
2009,foot-stalks and tendrils are sensitive.
2009,
2009,"It is scarcely possible that the above slight movements, due to a touch"
2009,"or shake, in the young and growing organs of plants, can be of any"
2009,"functional importance to them. But plants possess, in obedience to"
2009,"various stimuli, powers of movement, which are of manifest importance"
2009,"to them; for instance, towards and more rarely from the light--in"
2009,"opposition to, and more rarely in the direction of, the attraction"
2009,of gravity. When the nerves and muscles of an animal are excited by
2009,"galvanism or by the absorption of strychnine, the consequent movements"
2009,"may be called an incidental result, for the nerves and muscles have not"
2009,been rendered specially sensitive to these stimuli. So with plants it
2009,"appears that, from having the power of movement in obedience to certain"
2009,"stimuli, they are excited in an incidental manner by a touch, or by"
2009,being shaken. Hence there is no great difficulty in admitting that in
2009,"the case of leaf-climbers and tendril-bearers, it is this tendency which"
2009,has been taken advantage of and increased through natural selection. It
2009,"is, however, probable, from reasons which I have assigned in my memoir,"
2009,that this will have occurred only with plants which had already acquired
2009,"the power of revolving, and had thus become twiners."
2009,
2009,"I have already endeavoured to explain how plants became twiners,"
2009,"namely, by the increase of a tendency to slight and irregular revolving"
2009,"movements, which were at first of no use to them; this movement, as"
2009,"well as that due to a touch or shake, being the incidental result of"
2009,"the power of moving, gained for other and beneficial purposes. Whether,"
2009,"during the gradual development of climbing plants, natural selection"
2009,"has been aided by the inherited effects of use, I will not pretend to"
2009,"decide; but we know that certain periodical movements, for instance the"
2009,"so-called sleep of plants, are governed by habit."
2009,
2009,"I have now considered enough, perhaps more than enough, of the cases,"
2009,"selected with care by a skilful naturalist, to prove that natural"
2009,selection is incompetent to account for the incipient stages of
2009,"useful structures; and I have shown, as I hope, that there is no great"
2009,difficulty on this head. A good opportunity has thus been afforded for
2009,"enlarging a little on gradations of structure, often associated with"
2009,"strange functions--an important subject, which was not treated at"
2009,sufficient length in the former editions of this work. I will now
2009,briefly recapitulate the foregoing cases.
2009,
2009,"With the giraffe, the continued preservation of the individuals of some"
2009,"extinct high-reaching ruminant, which had the longest necks, legs, etc.,"
2009,"and could browse a little above the average height, and the continued"
2009,"destruction of those which could not browse so high, would have sufficed"
2009,for the production of this remarkable quadruped; but the prolonged
2009,"use of all the parts, together with inheritance, will have aided in an"
2009,important manner in their co-ordination. With the many insects which
2009,"imitate various objects, there is no improbability in the belief that"
2009,an accidental resemblance to some common object was in each case the
2009,"foundation for the work of natural selection, since perfected through"
2009,the occasional preservation of slight variations which made the
2009,resemblance at all closer; and this will have been carried on as long
2009,"as the insect continued to vary, and as long as a more and more perfect"
2009,resemblance led to its escape from sharp-sighted enemies. In certain
2009,species of whales there is a tendency to the formation of irregular
2009,little points of horn on the palate; and it seems to be quite within the
2009,"scope of natural selection to preserve all favourable variations, until"
2009,"the points were converted, first into lamellated knobs or teeth, like"
2009,"those on the beak of a goose--then into short lamellae, like those of"
2009,"the domestic ducks--and then into lamellae, as perfect as those of the"
2009,"shoveller-duck--and finally into the gigantic plates of baleen, as"
2009,"in the mouth of the Greenland whale. In the family of the ducks, the"
2009,"lamellae are first used as teeth, then partly as teeth and partly as"
2009,"a sifting apparatus, and at last almost exclusively for this latter"
2009,purpose.
2009,
2009,"With such structures as the above lamellae of horn or whalebone, habit"
2009,"or use can have done little or nothing, as far as we can judge, towards"
2009,"their development. On the other hand, the transportal of the lower eye"
2009,"of a flat-fish to the upper side of the head, and the formation of"
2009,"a prehensile tail, may be attributed almost wholly to continued use,"
2009,together with inheritance. With respect to the mammae of the higher
2009,"animals, the most probable conjecture is that primordially the cutaneous"
2009,glands over the whole surface of a marsupial sack secreted a nutritious
2009,fluid; and that these glands were improved in function through natural
2009,"selection, and concentrated into a confined area, in which case they"
2009,would have formed a mamma. There is no more difficulty in understanding
2009,"how the branched spines of some ancient Echinoderm, which served as"
2009,"a defence, became developed through natural selection into tridactyle"
2009,"pedicellariae, than in understanding the development of the pincers of"
2009,"crustaceans, through slight, serviceable modifications in the ultimate"
2009,"and penultimate segments of a limb, which was at first used solely"
2009,for locomotion. In the avicularia and vibracula of the Polyzoa we have
2009,organs widely different in appearance developed from the same source;
2009,and with the vibracula we can understand how the successive gradations
2009,"might have been of service. With the pollinia of orchids, the threads"
2009,"which originally served to tie together the pollen-grains, can be traced"
2009,cohering into caudicles; and the steps can likewise be followed by which
2009,"viscid matter, such as that secreted by the stigmas of ordinary flowers,"
2009,"and still subserving nearly but not quite the same purpose, became"
2009,attached to the free ends of the caudicles--all these gradations being
2009,of manifest benefit to the plants in question. With respect to climbing
2009,"plants, I need not repeat what has been so lately said."
2009,
2009,"It has often been asked, if natural selection be so potent, why has not"
2009,"this or that structure been gained by certain species, to which it would"
2009,apparently have been advantageous? But it is unreasonable to expect a
2009,"precise answer to such questions, considering our ignorance of the past"
2009,"history of each species, and of the conditions which at the present day"
2009,"determine its numbers and range. In most cases only general reasons,"
2009,"but in some few cases special reasons, can be assigned. Thus to adapt"
2009,"a species to new habits of life, many co-ordinated modifications are"
2009,"almost indispensable, and it may often have happened that the requisite"
2009,parts did not vary in the right manner or to the right degree. Many
2009,species must have been prevented from increasing in numbers through
2009,"destructive agencies, which stood in no relation to certain structures,"
2009,which we imagine would have been gained through natural selection
2009,"from appearing to us advantageous to the species. In this case, as the"
2009,"struggle for life did not depend on such structures, they could not"
2009,have been acquired through natural selection. In many cases complex and
2009,"long-enduring conditions, often of a peculiar nature, are necessary for"
2009,the development of a structure; and the requisite conditions may seldom
2009,"have concurred. The belief that any given structure, which we think,"
2009,"often erroneously, would have been beneficial to a species, would"
2009,"have been gained under all circumstances through natural selection, is"
2009,opposed to what we can understand of its manner of action. Mr. Mivart
2009,does not deny that natural selection has effected something; but he
2009,"considers it as ""demonstrably insufficient"" to account for the phenomena"
2009,which I explain by its agency. His chief arguments have now been
2009,"considered, and the others will hereafter be considered. They seem to me"
2009,"to partake little of the character of demonstration, and to have little"
2009,weight in comparison with those in favour of the power of natural
2009,"selection, aided by the other agencies often specified. I am bound to"
2009,"add, that some of the facts and arguments here used by me, have been"
2009,advanced for the same purpose in an able article lately published in the
2009,"""Medico-Chirurgical Review."""
2009,
2009,At the present day almost all naturalists admit evolution under some
2009,"form. Mr. Mivart believes that species change through ""an internal force"
2009,"or tendency,"" about which it is not pretended that anything is known."
2009,That species have a capacity for change will be admitted by all
2009,"evolutionists; but there is no need, as it seems to me, to invoke"
2009,"any internal force beyond the tendency to ordinary variability, which"
2009,"through the aid of selection, by man has given rise to many well-adapted"
2009,"domestic races, and which, through the aid of natural selection, would"
2009,equally well give rise by graduated steps to natural races or species.
2009,"The final result will generally have been, as already explained, an"
2009,"advance, but in some few cases a retrogression, in organisation."
2009,
2009,"Mr. Mivart is further inclined to believe, and some naturalists agree"
2009,"with him, that new species manifest themselves ""with suddenness and by"
2009,"modifications appearing at once."" For instance, he supposes that the"
2009,differences between the extinct three-toed Hipparion and the horse arose
2009,"suddenly. He thinks it difficult to believe that the wing of a bird ""was"
2009,developed in any other way than by a comparatively sudden modification
2009,"of a marked and important kind;"" and apparently he would extend the"
2009,"same view to the wings of bats and pterodactyles. This conclusion,"
2009,"which implies great breaks or discontinuity in the series, appears to me"
2009,improbable in the highest degree.
2009,
2009,"Everyone who believes in slow and gradual evolution, will of course"
2009,admit that specific changes may have been as abrupt and as great as
2009,"any single variation which we meet with under nature, or even under"
2009,domestication. But as species are more variable when domesticated or
2009,"cultivated than under their natural conditions, it is not probable that"
2009,"such great and abrupt variations have often occurred under nature, as"
2009,are known occasionally to arise under domestication. Of these latter
2009,variations several may be attributed to reversion; and the characters
2009,"which thus reappear were, it is probable, in many cases at first"
2009,gained in a gradual manner. A still greater number must be called
2009,"monstrosities, such as six-fingered men, porcupine men, Ancon sheep,"
2009,"Niata cattle, etc.; and as they are widely different in character from"
2009,"natural species, they throw very little light on our subject. Excluding"
2009,"such cases of abrupt variations, the few which remain would at best"
2009,"constitute, if found in a state of nature, doubtful species, closely"
2009,related to their parental types.
2009,
2009,My reasons for doubting whether natural species have changed as abruptly
2009,"as have occasionally domestic races, and for entirely disbelieving that"
2009,"they have changed in the wonderful manner indicated by Mr. Mivart, are"
2009,"as follows. According to our experience, abrupt and strongly marked"
2009,"variations occur in our domesticated productions, singly and at rather"
2009,"long intervals of time. If such occurred under nature, they would"
2009,"be liable, as formerly explained, to be lost by accidental causes of"
2009,destruction and by subsequent intercrossing; and so it is known to be
2009,"under domestication, unless abrupt variations of this kind are specially"
2009,"preserved and separated by the care of man. Hence, in order that a new"
2009,"species should suddenly appear in the manner supposed by Mr. Mivart,"
2009,"it is almost necessary to believe, in opposition to all analogy, that"
2009,several wonderfully changed individuals appeared simultaneously within
2009,"the same district. This difficulty, as in the case of unconscious"
2009,"selection by man, is avoided on the theory of gradual evolution, through"
2009,"the preservation of a large number of individuals, which varied more"
2009,"or less in any favourable direction, and of the destruction of a large"
2009,number which varied in an opposite manner.
2009,
2009,"That many species have been evolved in an extremely gradual manner,"
2009,there can hardly be a doubt. The species and even the genera of many
2009,large natural families are so closely allied together that it is
2009,"difficult to distinguish not a few of them. On every continent, in"
2009,"proceeding from north to south, from lowland to upland, etc., we meet"
2009,with a host of closely related or representative species; as we likewise
2009,"do on certain distinct continents, which we have reason to believe were"
2009,"formerly connected. But in making these and the following remarks, I am"
2009,compelled to allude to subjects hereafter to be discussed. Look at
2009,"the many outlying islands round a continent, and see how many of their"
2009,inhabitants can be raised only to the rank of doubtful species. So it is
2009,"if we look to past times, and compare the species which have just passed"
2009,away with those still living within the same areas; or if we compare
2009,the fossil species embedded in the sub-stages of the same geological
2009,formation. It is indeed manifest that multitudes of species are related
2009,"in the closest manner to other species that still exist, or have lately"
2009,existed; and it will hardly be maintained that such species have been
2009,"developed in an abrupt or sudden manner. Nor should it be forgotten,"
2009,"when we look to the special parts of allied species, instead of to"
2009,"distinct species, that numerous and wonderfully fine gradations can be"
2009,"traced, connecting together widely different structures."
2009,
2009,Many large groups of facts are intelligible only on the principle that
2009,"species have been evolved by very small steps. For instance, the fact"
2009,that the species included in the larger genera are more closely related
2009,"to each other, and present a greater number of varieties than do the"
2009,species in the smaller genera. The former are also grouped in little
2009,"clusters, like varieties round species; and they present other analogies"
2009,"with varieties, as was shown in our second chapter. On this same"
2009,principle we can understand how it is that specific characters are more
2009,variable than generic characters; and how the parts which are developed
2009,in an extraordinary degree or manner are more variable than other parts
2009,"of the same species. Many analogous facts, all pointing in the same"
2009,"direction, could be added."
2009,
2009,Although very many species have almost certainly been produced by
2009,steps not greater than those separating fine varieties; yet it may
2009,be maintained that some have been developed in a different and abrupt
2009,"manner. Such an admission, however, ought not to be made without strong"
2009,"evidence being assigned. The vague and in some respects false analogies,"
2009,"as they have been shown to be by Mr. Chauncey Wright, which have been"
2009,"advanced in favour of this view, such as the sudden crystallisation of"
2009,"inorganic substances, or the falling of a facetted spheroid from one"
2009,"facet to another, hardly deserve consideration. One class of facts,"
2009,"however, namely, the sudden appearance of new and distinct forms of"
2009,life in our geological formations supports at first sight the belief in
2009,abrupt development. But the value of this evidence depends entirely on
2009,"the perfection of the geological record, in relation to periods remote"
2009,in the history of the world. If the record is as fragmentary as many
2009,"geologists strenuously assert, there is nothing strange in new forms"
2009,appearing as if suddenly developed.
2009,
2009,Unless we admit transformations as prodigious as those advocated by Mr.
2009,"Mivart, such as the sudden development of the wings of birds or bats, or"
2009,"the sudden conversion of a Hipparion into a horse, hardly any light"
2009,is thrown by the belief in abrupt modifications on the deficiency of
2009,connecting links in our geological formations. But against the belief in
2009,"such abrupt changes, embryology enters a strong protest. It is notorious"
2009,"that the wings of birds and bats, and the legs of horses or other"
2009,"quadrupeds, are undistinguishable at an early embryonic period, and"
2009,that they become differentiated by insensibly fine steps. Embryological
2009,"resemblances of all kinds can be accounted for, as we shall hereafter"
2009,"see, by the progenitors of our existing species having varied after"
2009,"early youth, and having transmitted their newly-acquired characters to"
2009,"their offspring, at a corresponding age. The embryo is thus left almost"
2009,"unaffected, and serves as a record of the past condition of the species."
2009,Hence it is that existing species during the early stages of their
2009,development so often resemble ancient and extinct forms belonging to the
2009,"same class. On this view of the meaning of embryological resemblances,"
2009,"and indeed on any view, it is incredible that an animal should have"
2009,undergone such momentous and abrupt transformations as those above
2009,"indicated, and yet should not bear even a trace in its embryonic"
2009,"condition of any sudden modification, every detail in its structure"
2009,being developed by insensibly fine steps.
2009,
2009,He who believes that some ancient form was transformed suddenly through
2009,"an internal force or tendency into, for instance, one furnished with"
2009,"wings, will be almost compelled to assume, in opposition to all analogy,"
2009,that many individuals varied simultaneously. It cannot be denied that
2009,such abrupt and great changes of structure are widely different from
2009,those which most species apparently have undergone. He will further be
2009,compelled to believe that many structures beautifully adapted to all the
2009,"other parts of the same creature and to the surrounding conditions,"
2009,have been suddenly produced; and of such complex and wonderful
2009,"co-adaptations, he will not be able to assign a shadow of an"
2009,explanation. He will be forced to admit that these great and sudden
2009,transformations have left no trace of their action on the embryo.
2009,"To admit all this is, as it seems to me, to enter into the realms of"
2009,"miracle, and to leave those of science."

2009,
2009,
2009,Many instincts are so wonderful that their development will probably
2009,appear to the reader a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole
2009,"theory. I may here premise, that I have nothing to do with the origin of"
2009,"the mental powers, any more than I have with that of life itself. We are"
2009,concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental
2009,faculties in animals of the same class.
2009,
2009,I will not attempt any definition of instinct. It would be easy to show
2009,that several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term;
2009,"but every one understands what is meant, when it is said that instinct"
2009,impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds'
2009,"nests. An action, which we ourselves require experience to enable us to"
2009,"perform, when performed by an animal, more especially by a very young"
2009,"one, without experience, and when performed by many individuals in the"
2009,"same way, without their knowing for what purpose it is performed, is"
2009,usually said to be instinctive. But I could show that none of these
2009,"characters are universal. A little dose of judgment or reason, as Pierre"
2009,"Huber expresses it, often comes into play, even with animals low in the"
2009,scale of nature.
2009,
2009,Frederick Cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared
2009,"instinct with habit. This comparison gives, I think, an accurate notion"
2009,"of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed, but"
2009,not necessarily of its origin. How unconsciously many habitual actions
2009,"are performed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious"
2009,will! yet they may be modified by the will or reason. Habits easily
2009,"become associated with other habits, with certain periods of time and"
2009,"states of the body. When once acquired, they often remain constant"
2009,throughout life. Several other points of resemblance between instincts
2009,"and habits could be pointed out. As in repeating a well-known song,"
2009,"so in instincts, one action follows another by a sort of rhythm; if a"
2009,"person be interrupted in a song, or in repeating anything by rote, he is"
2009,generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of thought: so
2009,"P. Huber found it was with a caterpillar, which makes a very complicated"
2009,hammock; for if he took a caterpillar which had completed its hammock
2009,"up to, say, the sixth stage of construction, and put it into a"
2009,"hammock completed up only to the third stage, the caterpillar simply"
2009,"re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of construction."
2009,"If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for"
2009,"instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the"
2009,"sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from"
2009,"deriving any benefit from this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order"
2009,"to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage,"
2009,"where it had left off, and thus tried to complete the already finished"
2009,work.
2009,
2009,If we suppose any habitual action to become inherited--and it can be
2009,shown that this does sometimes happen--then the resemblance between what
2009,originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be
2009,"distinguished. If Mozart, instead of playing the pianoforte at three"
2009,"years old with wonderfully little practice, had played a tune with no"
2009,"practice at all, be might truly be said to have done so instinctively."
2009,But it would be a serious error to suppose that the greater number
2009,"of instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation, and then"
2009,transmitted by inheritance to succeeding generations. It can be clearly
2009,"shown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted,"
2009,"namely, those of the hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have"
2009,been acquired by habit.
2009,
2009,It will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as
2009,"corporeal structures for the welfare of each species, under its present"
2009,"conditions of life. Under changed conditions of life, it is at least"
2009,possible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a
2009,"species; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little,"
2009,then I can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and
2009,continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that was
2009,"profitable. It is thus, as I believe, that all the most complex and"
2009,wonderful instincts have originated. As modifications of corporeal
2009,"structure arise from, and are increased by, use or habit, and are"
2009,"diminished or lost by disuse, so I do not doubt it has been with"
2009,instincts. But I believe that the effects of habit are in many cases of
2009,subordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of
2009,what may be called spontaneous variations of instincts;--that is of
2009,variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight
2009,deviations of bodily structure.
2009,
2009,"No complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural selection,"
2009,"except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous, slight, yet"
2009,"profitable, variations. Hence, as in the case of corporeal structures,"
2009,"we ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by"
2009,which each complex instinct has been acquired--for these could be found
2009,only in the lineal ancestors of each species--but we ought to find in
2009,the collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations; or
2009,we ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are
2009,"possible; and this we certainly can do. I have been surprised to find,"
2009,making allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little
2009,"observed, except in Europe and North America, and for no instinct being"
2009,"known among extinct species, how very generally gradations, leading to"
2009,"the most complex instincts, can be discovered. Changes of instinct may"
2009,sometimes be facilitated by the same species having different instincts
2009,"at different periods of life, or at different seasons of the year, or"
2009,"when placed under different circumstances, etc.; in which case either"
2009,the one or the other instinct might be preserved by natural selection.
2009,And such instances of diversity of instinct in the same species can be
2009,shown to occur in nature.
2009,
2009,"Again, as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably to my"
2009,"theory, the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has never,"
2009,"as far as we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good of others."
2009,One of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an
2009,"action for the sole good of another, with which I am acquainted, is that"
2009,"of aphides voluntarily yielding, as was first observed by Huber, their"
2009,"sweet excretion to ants: that they do so voluntarily, the following"
2009,facts show. I removed all the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides
2009,"on a dock-plant, and prevented their attendance during several hours."
2009,"After this interval, I felt sure that the aphides would want to excrete."
2009,"I watched them for some time through a lens, but not one excreted; I"
2009,"then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same manner, as well"
2009,"as I could, as the ants do with their antennae; but not one excreted."
2009,"Afterwards, I allowed an ant to visit them, and it immediately seemed,"
2009,by its eager way of running about to be well aware what a rich flock it
2009,had discovered; it then began to play with its antennae on the abdomen
2009,"first of one aphis and then of another; and each, as soon as it felt the"
2009,"antennae, immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop"
2009,"of sweet juice, which was eagerly devoured by the ant. Even the quite"
2009,"young aphides behaved in this manner, showing that the action was"
2009,"instinctive, and not the result of experience. It is certain, from the"
2009,"observations of Huber, that the aphides show no dislike to the ants:"
2009,if the latter be not present they are at last compelled to eject their
2009,"excretion. But as the excretion is extremely viscid, it is no doubt a"
2009,convenience to the aphides to have it removed; therefore probably they
2009,do not excrete solely for the good of the ants. Although there is no
2009,evidence that any animal performs an action for the exclusive good of
2009,"another species, yet each tries to take advantage of the instincts of"
2009,"others, as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of other"
2009,species. So again certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutely
2009,perfect; but as details on this and other such points are not
2009,"indispensable, they may be here passed over."
2009,
2009,"As some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature, and"
2009,"the inheritance of such variations, are indispensable for the action of"
2009,"natural selection, as many instances as possible ought to be given; but"
2009,want of space prevents me. I can only assert that instincts certainly
2009,"do vary--for instance, the migratory instinct, both in extent and"
2009,"direction, and in its total loss. So it is with the nests of birds,"
2009,"which vary partly in dependence on the situations chosen, and on the"
2009,"nature and temperature of the country inhabited, but often from causes"
2009,wholly unknown to us. Audubon has given several remarkable cases
2009,of differences in the nests of the same species in the northern and
2009,"southern United States. Why, it has been asked, if instinct be variable,"
2009,"has it not granted to the bee ""the ability to use some other material"
2009,"when wax was deficient?"" But what other natural material could bees"
2009,"use? They will work, as I have seen, with wax hardened with vermilion"
2009,"or softened with lard. Andrew Knight observed that his bees, instead of"
2009,"laboriously collecting propolis, used a cement of wax and turpentine,"
2009,with which he had covered decorticated trees. It has lately been shown
2009,"that bees, instead of searching for pollen, will gladly use a very"
2009,"different substance, namely, oatmeal. Fear of any particular enemy is"
2009,"certainly an instinctive quality, as may be seen in nestling birds,"
2009,"though it is strengthened by experience, and by the sight of fear of the"
2009,"same enemy in other animals. The fear of man is slowly acquired, as"
2009,"I have elsewhere shown, by the various animals which inhabit desert"
2009,"islands; and we see an instance of this, even in England, in the greater"
2009,wildness of all our large birds in comparison with our small birds;
2009,for the large birds have been most persecuted by man. We may safely
2009,attribute the greater wildness of our large birds to this cause; for in
2009,uninhabited islands large birds are not more fearful than small; and the
2009,"magpie, so wary in England, is tame in Norway, as is the hooded crow in"
2009,Egypt.
2009,
2009,"That the mental qualities of animals of the same kind, born in a state"
2009,"of nature, vary much, could be shown by many facts. Several cases could"
2009,"also be adduced of occasional and strange habits in wild animals, which,"
2009,"if advantageous to the species, might have given rise, through natural"
2009,"selection, to new instincts. But I am well aware that these general"
2009,"statements, without the facts in detail, can produce but a feeble effect"
2009,"on the reader's mind. I can only repeat my assurance, that I do not"
2009,speak without good evidence.
2009,
2009,INHERITED CHANGES OF HABIT OR INSTINCT IN DOMESTICATED ANIMALS.
2009,
2009,"The possibility, or even probability, of inherited variations"
2009,of instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly
2009,considering a few cases under domestication. We shall thus be enabled
2009,to see the part which habit and the selection of so-called spontaneous
2009,variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our domestic
2009,animals. It is notorious how much domestic animals vary in their mental
2009,"qualities. With cats, for instance, one naturally takes to catching"
2009,"rats, and another mice, and these tendencies are known to be inherited."
2009,"One cat, according to Mr. St. John, always brought home game birds,"
2009,"another hares or rabbits, and another hunted on marshy ground and almost"
2009,nightly caught woodcocks or snipes. A number of curious and authentic
2009,"instances could be given of various shades of disposition and taste, and"
2009,"likewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain frames of mind or"
2009,periods of time. But let us look to the familiar case of the breeds
2009,of dogs: it cannot be doubted that young pointers (I have myself seen
2009,striking instances) will sometimes point and even back other dogs the
2009,very first time that they are taken out; retrieving is certainly in some
2009,"degree inherited by retrievers; and a tendency to run round, instead of"
2009,"at, a flock of sheep, by shepherd-dogs. I cannot see that these actions,"
2009,"performed without experience by the young, and in nearly the same manner"
2009,"by each individual, performed with eager delight by each breed, and"
2009,without the end being known--for the young pointer can no more know that
2009,"he points to aid his master, than the white butterfly knows why she lays"
2009,her eggs on the leaf of the cabbage--I cannot see that these actions
2009,differ essentially from true instincts. If we were to behold one kind
2009,"of wolf, when young and without any training, as soon as it scented its"
2009,"prey, stand motionless like a statue, and then slowly crawl forward with"
2009,"a peculiar gait; and another kind of wolf rushing round, instead of at,"
2009,"a herd of deer, and driving them to a distant point, we should assuredly"
2009,"call these actions instinctive. Domestic instincts, as they may be"
2009,"called, are certainly far less fixed than natural instincts; but"
2009,"they have been acted on by far less rigorous selection, and have"
2009,"been transmitted for an incomparably shorter period, under less fixed"
2009,conditions of life.
2009,
2009,"How strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions are"
2009,"inherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when"
2009,different breeds of dogs are crossed. Thus it is known that a cross with
2009,a bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy
2009,of greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family
2009,"of shepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares. These domestic instincts,"
2009,"when thus tested by crossing, resemble natural instincts, which in a"
2009,"like manner become curiously blended together, and for a long period"
2009,"exhibit traces of the instincts of either parent: for example, Le Roy"
2009,"describes a dog, whose great-grandfather was a wolf, and this dog"
2009,"showed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way, by not coming in a"
2009,"straight line to his master, when called."
2009,
2009,Domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become
2009,"inherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this is"
2009,"not true. No one would ever have thought of teaching, or probably could"
2009,"have taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble--an action which, as I have"
2009,"witnessed, is performed by young birds, that have never seen a pigeon"
2009,tumble. We may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to
2009,"this strange habit, and that the long-continued selection of the best"
2009,individuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are;
2009,"and near Glasgow there are house-tumblers, as I hear from Mr. Brent,"
2009,which cannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels. It
2009,may be doubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to
2009,"point, had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line; and"
2009,"this is known occasionally to happen, as I once saw, in a pure terrier:"
2009,"the act of pointing is probably, as many have thought, only the"
2009,exaggerated pause of an animal preparing to spring on its prey. When the
2009,"first tendency to point was once displayed, methodical selection and the"
2009,inherited effects of compulsory training in each successive generation
2009,would soon complete the work; and unconscious selection is still in
2009,"progress, as each man tries to procure, without intending to improve the"
2009,"breed, dogs which stand and hunt best. On the other hand, habit alone"
2009,in some cases has sufficed; hardly any animal is more difficult to tame
2009,than the young of the wild rabbit; scarcely any animal is tamer than the
2009,young of the tame rabbit; but I can hardly suppose that domestic rabbits
2009,have often been selected for tameness alone; so that we must attribute
2009,at least the greater part of the inherited change from extreme wildness
2009,"to extreme tameness, to habit and long-continued close confinement."
2009,
2009,Natural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance of
2009,this is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become
2009,"""broody,"" that is, never wish to sit on their eggs. Familiarity alone"
2009,prevents our seeing how largely and how permanently the minds of our
2009,domestic animals have been modified. It is scarcely possible to doubt
2009,"that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog. All wolves,"
2009,"foxes, jackals and species of the cat genus, when kept tame, are most"
2009,"eager to attack poultry, sheep and pigs; and this tendency has been"
2009,found incurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from
2009,"countries such as Tierra del Fuego and Australia, where the savages do"
2009,"not keep these domestic animals. How rarely, on the other hand, do"
2009,"our civilised dogs, even when quite young, require to be taught not to"
2009,"attack poultry, sheep, and pigs! No doubt they occasionally do make an"
2009,"attack, and are then beaten; and if not cured, they are destroyed;"
2009,so that habit and some degree of selection have probably concurred in
2009,"civilising by inheritance our dogs. On the other hand, young chickens"
2009,"have lost wholly by habit, that fear of the dog and cat which no doubt"
2009,"was originally instinctive in them, for I am informed by Captain Hutton"
2009,"that the young chickens of the parent stock, the Gallus bankiva, when"
2009,"reared in India under a hen, are at first excessively wild. So it is"
2009,with young pheasants reared in England under a hen. It is not that
2009,"chickens have lost all fear, but fear only of dogs and cats, for if"
2009,the hen gives the danger chuckle they will run (more especially young
2009,turkeys) from under her and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass
2009,or thickets; and this is evidently done for the instinctive purpose of
2009,"allowing, as we see in wild ground-birds, their mother to fly away."
2009,But this instinct retained by our chickens has become useless under
2009,"domestication, for the mother-hen has almost lost by disuse the power of"
2009,flight.
2009,
2009,"Hence, we may conclude that under domestication instincts have been"
2009,"acquired and natural instincts have been lost, partly by habit and"
2009,"partly by man selecting and accumulating, during successive generations,"
2009,"peculiar mental habits and actions, which at first appeared from what we"
2009,must in our ignorance call an accident. In some cases compulsory habit
2009,alone has sufficed to produce inherited mental changes; in other cases
2009,"compulsory habit has done nothing, and all has been the result of"
2009,"selection, pursued both methodically and unconsciously; but in most"
2009,cases habit and selection have probably concurred.
2009,
2009,SPECIAL INSTINCTS.
2009,
2009,"We shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of nature"
2009,have become modified by selection by considering a few cases. I will
2009,"select only three, namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay"
2009,her eggs in other birds' nests; the slave-making instinct of certain
2009,ants; and the cell-making power of the hive-bee: these two latter
2009,instincts have generally and justly been ranked by naturalists as the
2009,most wonderful of all known instincts.
2009,
2009,INSTINCTS OF THE CUCKOO.
2009,
2009,It is supposed by some naturalists that the more immediate cause of
2009,"the instinct of the cuckoo is that she lays her eggs, not daily, but"
2009,"at intervals of two or three days; so that, if she were to make her own"
2009,"nest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left"
2009,for some time unincubated or there would be eggs and young birds of
2009,different ages in the same nest. If this were the case the process of
2009,"laying and hatching might be inconveniently long, more especially as"
2009,she migrates at a very early period; and the first hatched young would
2009,probably have to be fed by the male alone. But the American cuckoo is
2009,"in this predicament, for she makes her own nest and has eggs and young"
2009,"successively hatched, all at the same time. It has been both asserted"
2009,and denied that the American cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other
2009,"birds' nests; but I have lately heard from Dr. Merrill, of Iowa, that he"
2009,"once found in Illinois a young cuckoo, together with a young jay in the"
2009,nest of a blue jay (Garrulus cristatus); and as both were nearly full
2009,"feathered, there could be no mistake in their identification. I could"
2009,also give several instances of various birds which have been known
2009,occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds' nests. Now let us suppose
2009,that the ancient progenitor of our European cuckoo had the habits of the
2009,"American cuckoo, and that she occasionally laid an egg in another bird's"
2009,nest. If the old bird profited by this occasional habit through being
2009,enabled to emigrate earlier or through any other cause; or if the
2009,young were made more vigorous by advantage being taken of the mistaken
2009,"instinct of another species than when reared by their own mother,"
2009,encumbered as she could hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of
2009,"different ages at the same time, then the old birds or the fostered"
2009,young would gain an advantage. And analogy would lead us to believe
2009,that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the
2009,"occasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in their turn"
2009,"would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and thus be"
2009,more successful in rearing their young. By a continued process of this
2009,"nature, I believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo has been"
2009,"generated. It has, also recently been ascertained on sufficient"
2009,"evidence, by Adolf Muller, that the cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs"
2009,"on the bare ground, sits on them and feeds her young. This rare event"
2009,"is probably a case of reversion to the long-lost, aboriginal instinct of"
2009,nidification.
2009,
2009,It has been objected that I have not noticed other related instincts
2009,"and adaptations of structure in the cuckoo, which are spoken of as"
2009,"necessarily co-ordinated. But in all cases, speculation on an instinct"
2009,"known to us only in a single species, is useless, for we have hitherto"
2009,had no facts to guide us. Until recently the instincts of the European
2009,"and of the non-parasitic American cuckoo alone were known; now, owing"
2009,"to Mr. Ramsay's observations, we have learned something about three"
2009,"Australian species, which lay their eggs in other birds' nests. The"
2009,"chief points to be referred to are three: first, that the common cuckoo,"
2009,"with rare exceptions, lays only one egg in a nest, so that the large and"
2009,"voracious young bird receives ample food. Secondly, that the eggs are"
2009,"remarkably small, not exceeding those of the skylark--a bird about"
2009,one-fourth as large as the cuckoo. That the small size of the egg is a
2009,real case of adaptation we may infer from the fact of the mon-parasitic
2009,"American cuckoo laying full-sized eggs. Thirdly, that the young cuckoo,"
2009,"soon after birth, has the instinct, the strength and a properly shaped"
2009,"back for ejecting its foster-brothers, which then perish from cold and"
2009,"hunger. This has been boldly called a beneficent arrangement, in"
2009,"order that the young cuckoo may get sufficient food, and that its"
2009,foster-brothers may perish before they had acquired much feeling!
2009,
2009,Turning now to the Australian species: though these birds generally lay
2009,"only one egg in a nest, it is not rare to find two and even three eggs"
2009,"in the same nest. In the bronze cuckoo the eggs vary greatly in size,"
2009,"from eight to ten lines in length. Now, if it had been of an advantage"
2009,"to this species to have laid eggs even smaller than those now laid, so"
2009,"as to have deceived certain foster-parents, or, as is more probable, to"
2009,have been hatched within a shorter period (for it is asserted that
2009,there is a relation between the size of eggs and the period of their
2009,"incubation), then there is no difficulty in believing that a race or"
2009,species might have been formed which would have laid smaller and smaller
2009,eggs; for these would have been more safely hatched and reared. Mr.
2009,"Ramsay remarks that two of the Australian cuckoos, when they lay their"
2009,"eggs in an open nest, manifest a decided preference for nests containing"
2009,eggs similar in colour to their own. The European species apparently
2009,"manifests some tendency towards a similar instinct, but not rarely"
2009,"departs from it, as is shown by her laying her dull and pale-coloured"
2009,eggs in the nest of the hedge-warbler with bright greenish-blue eggs.
2009,"Had our cuckoo invariably displayed the above instinct, it would"
2009,assuredly have been added to those which it is assumed must all have
2009,"been acquired together. The eggs of the Australian bronze cuckoo vary,"
2009,"according to Mr. Ramsay, to an extraordinary degree in colour; so"
2009,"that in this respect, as well as in size, natural selection might have"
2009,secured and fixed any advantageous variation.
2009,
2009,"In the case of the European cuckoo, the offspring of the foster-parents"
2009,are commonly ejected from the nest within three days after the cuckoo is
2009,"hatched; and as the latter at this age is in a most helpless condition,"
2009,Mr. Gould was formerly inclined to believe that the act of ejection was
2009,performed by the foster-parents themselves. But he has now received a
2009,"trustworthy account of a young cuckoo which was actually seen, while"
2009,"still blind and not able even to hold up its own head, in the act of"
2009,ejecting its foster-brothers. One of these was replaced in the nest by
2009,"the observer, and was again thrown out. With respect to the means by"
2009,"which this strange and odious instinct was acquired, if it were of great"
2009,"importance for the young cuckoo, as is probably the case, to receive as"
2009,"much food as possible soon after birth, I can see no special difficulty"
2009,"in its having gradually acquired, during successive generations, the"
2009,"blind desire, the strength, and structure necessary for the work of"
2009,ejection; for those cuckoos which had such habits and structure best
2009,developed would be the most securely reared. The first step towards the
2009,acquisition of the proper instinct might have been mere unintentional
2009,"restlessness on the part of the young bird, when somewhat advanced"
2009,"in age and strength; the habit having been afterwards improved, and"
2009,transmitted to an earlier age. I can see no more difficulty in this than
2009,in the unhatched young of other birds acquiring the instinct to break
2009,through their own shells; or than in young snakes acquiring in their
2009,"upper jaws, as Owen has remarked, a transitory sharp tooth for cutting"
2009,through the tough egg-shell. For if each part is liable to individual
2009,"variations at all ages, and the variations tend to be inherited at"
2009,a corresponding or earlier age--propositions which cannot be
2009,disputed--then the instincts and structure of the young could be slowly
2009,modified as surely as those of the adult; and both cases must stand or
2009,fall together with the whole theory of natural selection.
2009,
2009,"Some species of Molothrus, a widely distinct genus of American birds,"
2009,"allied to our starlings, have parasitic habits like those of the cuckoo;"
2009,and the species present an interesting gradation in the perfection
2009,of their instincts. The sexes of Molothrus badius are stated by an
2009,"excellent observer, Mr. Hudson, sometimes to live promiscuously together"
2009,"in flocks, and sometimes to pair. They either build a nest of their own"
2009,"or seize on one belonging to some other bird, occasionally throwing out"
2009,the nestlings of the stranger. They either lay their eggs in the nest
2009,"thus appropriated, or oddly enough build one for themselves on the top"
2009,of it. They usually sit on their own eggs and rear their own young; but
2009,"Mr. Hudson says it is probable that they are occasionally parasitic, for"
2009,he has seen the young of this species following old birds of a distinct
2009,kind and clamouring to be fed by them. The parasitic habits of another
2009,"species of Molothrus, the M. bonariensis, are much more highly developed"
2009,"than those of the last, but are still far from perfect. This bird, as"
2009,"far as it is known, invariably lays its eggs in the nests of strangers;"
2009,but it is remarkable that several together sometimes commence to build
2009,"an irregular untidy nest of their own, placed in singular ill-adapted"
2009,"situations, as on the leaves of a large thistle. They never, however, as"
2009,"far as Mr. Hudson has ascertained, complete a nest for themselves. They"
2009,"often lay so many eggs--from fifteen to twenty--in the same foster-nest,"
2009,"that few or none can possibly be hatched. They have, moreover, the"
2009,"extraordinary habit of pecking holes in the eggs, whether of their own"
2009,"species or of their foster parents, which they find in the appropriated"
2009,"nests. They drop also many eggs on the bare ground, which are thus"
2009,"wasted. A third species, the M. pecoris of North America, has acquired"
2009,"instincts as perfect as those of the cuckoo, for it never lays more than"
2009,"one egg in a foster-nest, so that the young bird is securely reared. Mr."
2009,"Hudson is a strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been"
2009,so much struck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus bonariensis
2009,"that he quotes my words, and asks, ""Must we consider these habits, not"
2009,"as especially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of"
2009,"one general law, namely, transition?"""
2009,
2009,"Various birds, as has already been remarked, occasionally lay their eggs"
2009,in the nests of other birds. This habit is not very uncommon with the
2009,"Gallinaceae, and throws some light on the singular instinct of the"
2009,ostrich. In this family several hen birds unite and lay first a few eggs
2009,in one nest and then in another; and these are hatched by the males.
2009,This instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the hens
2009,"laying a large number of eggs, but, as with the cuckoo, at intervals of"
2009,"two or three days. The instinct, however, of the American ostrich, as"
2009,"in the case of the Molothrus bonariensis, has not as yet been perfected;"
2009,"for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains, so that in"
2009,one day's hunting I picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs.
2009,
2009,"Many bees are parasitic, and regularly lay their eggs in the nests"
2009,of other kinds of bees. This case is more remarkable than that of the
2009,cuckoo; for these bees have not only had their instincts but their
2009,structure modified in accordance with their parasitic habits; for they
2009,do not possess the pollen-collecting apparatus which would have been
2009,indispensable if they had stored up food for their own young. Some
2009,species of Sphegidae (wasp-like insects) are likewise parasitic; and
2009,"M. Fabre has lately shown good reason for believing that, although"
2009,the Tachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with
2009,"paralysed prey for its own larvae, yet that, when this insect finds a"
2009,"burrow already made and stored by another sphex, it takes advantage of"
2009,"the prize, and becomes for the occasion parasitic. In this case, as"
2009,"with that of the Molothrus or cuckoo, I can see no difficulty in natural"
2009,"selection making an occasional habit permanent, if of advantage to the"
2009,"species, and if the insect whose nest and stored food are feloniously"
2009,"appropriated, be not thus exterminated."
2009,
2009,SLAVE-MAKING INSTINCT.
2009,
2009,This remarkable instinct was first discovered in the Formica (Polyerges)
2009,"rufescens by Pierre Huber, a better observer even than his celebrated"
2009,father. This ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves; without their
2009,"aid, the species would certainly become extinct in a single year. The"
2009,"males and fertile females do no work of any kind, and the workers or"
2009,"sterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing"
2009,"slaves, do no other work. They are incapable of making their own nests,"
2009,"or of feeding their own larvae. When the old nest is found inconvenient,"
2009,"and they have to migrate, it is the slaves which determine the"
2009,"migration, and actually carry their masters in their jaws. So utterly"
2009,"helpless are the masters, that when Huber shut up thirty of them without"
2009,"a slave, but with plenty of the food which they like best, and with"
2009,"their larvae and pupae to stimulate them to work, they did nothing; they"
2009,"could not even feed themselves, and many perished of hunger. Huber then"
2009,"introduced a single slave (F. fusca), and she instantly set to work, fed"
2009,"and saved the survivors; made some cells and tended the larvae, and"
2009,put all to rights. What can be more extraordinary than these
2009,well-ascertained facts? If we had not known of any other slave-making
2009,"ant, it would have been hopeless to speculate how so wonderful an"
2009,instinct could have been perfected.
2009,
2009,"Another species, Formica sanguinea, was likewise first discovered by P."
2009,Huber to be a slave-making ant. This species is found in the southern
2009,"parts of England, and its habits have been attended to by Mr. F. Smith,"
2009,"of the British Museum, to whom I am much indebted for information on"
2009,this and other subjects. Although fully trusting to the statements of
2009,"Huber and Mr. Smith, I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical"
2009,"frame of mind, as any one may well be excused for doubting the existence"
2009,"of so extraordinary an instinct as that of making slaves. Hence, I"
2009,will give the observations which I made in some little detail. I opened
2009,"fourteen nests of F. sanguinea, and found a few slaves in all. Males and"
2009,fertile females of the slave-species (F. fusca) are found only in their
2009,"own proper communities, and have never been observed in the nests of F."
2009,sanguinea. The slaves are black and not above half the size of their
2009,"red masters, so that the contrast in their appearance is great. When the"
2009,"nest is slightly disturbed, the slaves occasionally come out, and like"
2009,their masters are much agitated and defend the nest: when the nest is
2009,"much disturbed, and the larvae and pupae are exposed, the slaves work"
2009,energetically together with their masters in carrying them away to a
2009,"place of safety. Hence, it is clear that the slaves feel quite at home."
2009,"During the months of June and July, on three successive years, I watched"
2009,"for many hours several nests in Surrey and Sussex, and never saw a slave"
2009,"either leave or enter a nest. As, during these months, the slaves are"
2009,"very few in number, I thought that they might behave differently when"
2009,more numerous; but Mr. Smith informs me that he has watched the nests at
2009,"various hours during May, June and August, both in Surrey and Hampshire,"
2009,"and has never seen the slaves, though present in large numbers in"
2009,"August, either leave or enter the nest. Hence, he considers them as"
2009,"strictly household slaves. The masters, on the other hand, may be"
2009,"constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest, and food of all"
2009,"kinds. During the year , however, in the month of July, I came"
2009,"across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves, and I"
2009,"observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest, and"
2009,"marching along the same road to a tall Scotch-fir tree, twenty-five"
2009,"yards distant, which they ascended together, probably in search of"
2009,"aphides or cocci. According to Huber, who had ample opportunities"
2009,"for observation, the slaves in Switzerland habitually work with their"
2009,"masters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in"
2009,"the morning and evening; and, as Huber expressly states, their principal"
2009,office is to search for aphides. This difference in the usual habits of
2009,"the masters and slaves in the two countries, probably depends merely"
2009,on the slaves being captured in greater numbers in Switzerland than in
2009,England.
2009,
2009,One day I fortunately witnessed a migration of F. sanguinea from one
2009,"nest to another, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the"
2009,masters carefully carrying their slaves in their jaws instead of
2009,"being carried by them, as in the case of F. rufescens. Another day my"
2009,attention was struck by about a score of the slave-makers haunting the
2009,"same spot, and evidently not in search of food; they approached and were"
2009,vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave species (F.
2009,fusca); sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging to the legs of
2009,the slave-making F. sanguinea. The latter ruthlessly killed their
2009,"small opponents and carried their dead bodies as food to their nest,"
2009,twenty-nine yards distant; but they were prevented from getting any
2009,pupae to rear as slaves. I then dug up a small parcel of the pupae of F.
2009,"fusca from another nest, and put them down on a bare spot near the place"
2009,"of combat; they were eagerly seized and carried off by the tyrants, who"
2009,"perhaps fancied that, after all, they had been victorious in their late"
2009,combat.
2009,
2009,At the same time I laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupae of
2009,"another species, F. flava, with a few of these little yellow ants still"
2009,"clinging to the fragments of their nest. This species is sometimes,"
2009,"though rarely, made into slaves, as has been described by Mr. Smith."
2009,"Although so small a species, it is very courageous, and I have seen it"
2009,ferociously attack other ants. In one instance I found to my surprise
2009,an independent community of F. flava under a stone beneath a nest of the
2009,slave-making F. sanguinea; and when I had accidentally disturbed both
2009,"nests, the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprising"
2009,courage. Now I was curious to ascertain whether F. sanguinea could
2009,"distinguish the pupae of F. fusca, which they habitually make into"
2009,"slaves, from those of the little and furious F. flava, which they rarely"
2009,"capture, and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them;"
2009,for we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupae of F.
2009,"fusca, whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pupae,"
2009,"or even the earth from the nest, of F. flava, and quickly ran away; but"
2009,"in about a quarter of an hour, shortly after all the little yellow ants"
2009,"had crawled away, they took heart and carried off the pupae."
2009,
2009,"One evening I visited another community of F. sanguinea, and found a"
2009,"number of these ants returning home and entering their nests, carrying"
2009,the dead bodies of F. fusca (showing that it was not a migration) and
2009,"numerous pupae. I traced a long file of ants burdened with booty, for"
2009,"about forty yards back, to a very thick clump of heath, whence I saw the"
2009,"last individual of F. sanguinea emerge, carrying a pupa; but I was not"
2009,"able to find the desolated nest in the thick heath. The nest, however,"
2009,"must have been close at hand, for two or three individuals of F. fusca"
2009,"were rushing about in the greatest agitation, and one was perched"
2009,motionless with its own pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of
2009,"heath, an image of despair over its ravaged home."
2009,
2009,"Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in"
2009,regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves. Let it be observed
2009,what a contrast the instinctive habits of F. sanguinea present with
2009,those of the continental F. rufescens. The latter does not build its own
2009,"nest, does not determine its own migrations, does not collect food"
2009,"for itself or its young, and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely"
2009,"dependent on its numerous slaves. Formica sanguinea, on the other"
2009,"hand, possesses much fewer slaves, and in the early part of the summer"
2009,extremely few. The masters determine when and where a new nest shall
2009,"be formed, and when they migrate, the masters carry the slaves. Both in"
2009,Switzerland and England the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of
2009,"the larvae, and the masters alone go on slave-making expeditions. In"
2009,"Switzerland the slaves and masters work together, making and bringing"
2009,"materials for the nest: both, but chiefly the slaves, tend and milk"
2009,"as it may be called, their aphides; and thus both collect food for"
2009,the community. In England the masters alone usually leave the nest to
2009,"collect building materials and food for themselves, their slaves and"
2009,larvae. So that the masters in this country receive much less service
2009,from their slaves than they do in Switzerland.
2009,
2009,By what steps the instinct of F. sanguinea originated I will not pretend
2009,"to conjecture. But as ants which are not slave-makers, will, as I have"
2009,"seen, carry off pupae of other species, if scattered near their nests,"
2009,it is possible that such pupae originally stored as food might become
2009,developed; and the foreign ants thus unintentionally reared would then
2009,"follow their proper instincts, and do what work they could. If their"
2009,presence proved useful to the species which had seized them--if it were
2009,"more advantageous to this species, to capture workers than to procreate"
2009,"them--the habit of collecting pupae, originally for food, might by"
2009,natural selection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the
2009,very different purpose of raising slaves. When the instinct was once
2009,"acquired, if carried out to a much less extent even than in our British"
2009,"F. sanguinea, which, as we have seen, is less aided by its slaves than"
2009,"the same species in Switzerland, natural selection might increase and"
2009,modify the instinct--always supposing each modification to be of use to
2009,the species--until an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves
2009,as is the Formica rufescens.
2009,
2009,CELL-MAKING INSTINCT OF THE HIVE-BEE.
2009,
2009,"I will not here enter on minute details on this subject, but will merely"
2009,give an outline of the conclusions at which I have arrived. He must be
2009,"a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb, so"
2009,"beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration. We"
2009,hear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite
2009,"problem, and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the"
2009,"greatest possible amount of honey, with the least possible consumption"
2009,of precious wax in their construction. It has been remarked that a
2009,"skilful workman, with fitting tools and measures, would find it very"
2009,"difficult to make cells of wax of the true form, though this is effected"
2009,by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive. Granting whatever instincts
2009,"you please, it seems at first quite inconceivable how they can make"
2009,"all the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive when they are"
2009,correctly made. But the difficulty is not nearly so great as at first
2009,"appears: all this beautiful work can be shown, I think, to follow from a"
2009,few simple instincts.
2009,
2009,"I was led to investigate this subject by Mr. Waterhouse, who has shown"
2009,that the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of
2009,"adjoining cells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only"
2009,as a modification of his theory. Let us look to the great principle of
2009,"gradation, and see whether Nature does not reveal to us her method of"
2009,"work. At one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their"
2009,"old cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax,"
2009,and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax. At
2009,"the other end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in"
2009,"a double layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism,"
2009,with the basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join an inverted
2009,"pyramid, of three rhombs. These rhombs have certain angles, and the"
2009,three which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the
2009,"comb, enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells"
2009,on the opposite side. In the series between the extreme perfection of
2009,"the cells of the hive-bee and the simplicity of those of the humble-bee,"
2009,"we have the cells of the Mexican Melipona domestica, carefully described"
2009,and figured by Pierre Huber. The Melipona itself is intermediate in
2009,"structure between the hive and humble bee, but more nearly related to"
2009,"the latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells,"
2009,"in which the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of"
2009,wax for holding honey. These latter cells are nearly spherical and of
2009,"nearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an irregular mass. But the"
2009,"important point to notice is, that these cells are always made at that"
2009,degree of nearness to each other that they would have intersected or
2009,broken into each other if the spheres had been completed; but this is
2009,"never permitted, the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between"
2009,"the spheres which thus tend to intersect. Hence, each cell consists of"
2009,"an outer spherical portion, and of two, three, or more flat surfaces,"
2009,"according as the cell adjoins two, three or more other cells. When one"
2009,"cell rests on three other cells, which, from the spheres being nearly"
2009,"of the same size, is very frequently and necessarily the case, the three"
2009,"flat surfaces are united into a pyramid; and this pyramid, as Huber has"
2009,"remarked, is manifestly a gross imitation of the three-sided pyramidal"
2009,"base of the cell of the hive-bee. As in the cells of the hive-bee, so"
2009,"here, the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into"
2009,the construction of three adjoining cells. It is obvious that the
2009,"Melipona saves wax, and what is more important, labour, by this manner"
2009,of building; for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not
2009,"double, but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions,"
2009,and yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells.
2009,
2009,"Reflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the Melipona had made"
2009,"its spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made them of"
2009,"equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer,"
2009,the resulting structure would have been as perfect as the comb of the
2009,"hive-bee. Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller, of Cambridge, and"
2009,"this geometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up"
2009,"from his information, and tells me that it is strictly correct:--"
2009,
2009,If a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in
2009,two parallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at the distance of
2009,"radius x sqrt() or radius x . (or at some lesser distance), from"
2009,the centres of the six surrounding spheres in the same layer; and at the
2009,same distance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and
2009,"parallel layer; then, if planes of intersection between the several"
2009,"spheres in both layers be formed, there will result a double layer of"
2009,hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three
2009,rhombs; and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have
2009,every angle identically the same with the best measurements which have
2009,"been made of the cells of the hive-bee. But I hear from Professor Wyman,"
2009,"who has made numerous careful measurements, that the accuracy of the"
2009,"workmanship of the bee has been greatly exaggerated; so much so, that"
2009,"whatever the typical form of the cell may be, it is rarely, if ever,"
2009,realised.
2009,
2009,"Hence we may safely conclude that, if we could slightly modify the"
2009,"instincts already possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves not very"
2009,"wonderful, this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as"
2009,that of the hive-bee. We must suppose the Melipona to have the power of
2009,"forming her cells truly spherical, and of equal sizes; and this would"
2009,"not be very surprising, seeing that she already does so to a certain"
2009,"extent, and seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows many insects make"
2009,"in wood, apparently by turning round on a fixed point. We must suppose"
2009,"the Melipona to arrange her cells in level layers, as she already does"
2009,"her cylindrical cells; and we must further suppose, and this is the"
2009,"greatest difficulty, that she can somehow judge accurately at what"
2009,distance to stand from her fellow-labourers when several are making
2009,"their spheres; but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance,"
2009,that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect to a certain
2009,extent; and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat
2009,surfaces. By such modifications of instincts which in themselves are not
2009,very wonderful--hardly more wonderful than those which guide a bird to
2009,"make its nest--I believe that the hive-bee has acquired, through natural"
2009,"selection, her inimitable architectural powers."
2009,
2009,But this theory can be tested by experiment. Following the example of
2009,"Mr. Tegetmeier, I separated two combs, and put between them a long,"
2009,"thick, rectangular strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate"
2009,"minute circular pits in it; and as they deepened these little pits, they"
2009,"made them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins,"
2009,"appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of"
2009,"about the diameter of a cell. It was most interesting to observe that,"
2009,"wherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together,"
2009,they had begun their work at such a distance from each other that by
2009,the time the basins had acquired the above stated width (i.e. about the
2009,"width of an ordinary cell), and were in depth about one sixth of the"
2009,"diameter of the sphere of which they formed a part, the rims of the"
2009,"basins intersected or broke into each other. As soon as this occurred,"
2009,"the bees ceased to excavate, and began to build up flat walls of wax"
2009,"on the lines of intersection between the basins, so that each hexagonal"
2009,"prism was built upon the scalloped edge of a smooth basin, instead of on"
2009,the straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as in the case of ordinary
2009,cells.
2009,
2009,"I then put into the hive, instead of a thick, rectangular piece of wax,"
2009,"a thin and narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with vermilion. The bees"
2009,instantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each
2009,"other, in the same way as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin, that"
2009,"the bottoms of the basins, if they had been excavated to the same depth"
2009,"as in the former experiment, would have broken into each other from the"
2009,"opposite sides. The bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and"
2009,"they stopped their excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon"
2009,"as they had been a little deepened, came to have flat bases; and these"
2009,"flat bases, formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax left"
2009,"ungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge, exactly along"
2009,the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite
2009,"side of the ridge of wax. In some parts, only small portions, in other"
2009,"parts, large portions of a rhombic plate were thus left between the"
2009,"opposed basins, but the work, from the unnatural state of things, had"
2009,not been neatly performed. The bees must have worked at very nearly the
2009,same rate in circularly gnawing away and deepening the basins on both
2009,"sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, in order to have thus succeeded in"
2009,"leaving flat plates between the basins, by stopping work at the planes"
2009,of intersection.
2009,
2009,"Considering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is any"
2009,"difficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip"
2009,"of wax, perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper"
2009,"thinness, and then stopping their work. In ordinary combs it has"
2009,appeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly
2009,the same rate from the opposite sides; for I have noticed half-completed
2009,"rhombs at the base of a just-commenced cell, which were slightly concave"
2009,"on one side, where I suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly,"
2009,and convex on the opposed side where the bees had worked less quickly.
2009,"In one well-marked instance, I put the comb back into the hive, and"
2009,"allowed the bees to go on working for a short time, and again examined"
2009,"the cell, and I found that the rhombic plate had been completed, and had"
2009,"become PERFECTLY FLAT: it was absolutely impossible, from the extreme"
2009,"thinness of the little plate, that they could have effected this by"
2009,gnawing away the convex side; and I suspect that the bees in such cases
2009,stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm wax
2009,(which as I have tried is easily done) into its proper intermediate
2009,"plane, and thus flatten it."
2009,
2009,"From the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can see that, if"
2009,"the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they could"
2009,"make their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper distance"
2009,"from each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by endeavouring to"
2009,"make equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the spheres to break"
2009,"into each other. Now bees, as may be clearly seen by examining the edge"
2009,"of a growing comb, do make a rough, circumferential wall or rim all"
2009,"round the comb; and they gnaw this away from the opposite sides, always"
2009,working circularly as they deepen each cell. They do not make the whole
2009,"three-sided pyramidal base of any one cell at the same time, but only"
2009,"that one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme growing margin, or"
2009,"the two plates, as the case may be; and they never complete the upper"
2009,"edges of the rhombic plates, until the hexagonal walls are commenced."
2009,Some of these statements differ from those made by the justly celebrated
2009,"elder Huber, but I am convinced of their accuracy; and if I had space, I"
2009,could show that they are conformable with my theory.
2009,
2009,"Huber's statement, that the very first cell is excavated out of a little"
2009,"parallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as I have seen, strictly"
2009,correct; the first commencement having always been a little hood of
2009,wax; but I will not here enter on details. We see how important a part
2009,excavation plays in the construction of the cells; but it would be a
2009,great error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax
2009,"in the proper position--that is, along the plane of intersection between"
2009,two adjoining spheres. I have several specimens showing clearly that
2009,they can do this. Even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax
2009,"round a growing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding"
2009,in position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells.
2009,"But the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being"
2009,largely gnawed away on both sides. The manner in which the bees build is
2009,curious; they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times
2009,"thicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell, which will"
2009,"ultimately be left. We shall understand how they work, by supposing"
2009,"masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement, and then to begin"
2009,"cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground, till a smooth,"
2009,very thin wall is left in the middle; the masons always piling up the
2009,"cut-away cement, and adding fresh cement on the summit of the ridge. We"
2009,shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward but always crowned
2009,"by a gigantic coping. From all the cells, both those just commenced and"
2009,"those completed, being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax, the"
2009,bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate
2009,"hexagonal walls. These walls, as Professor Miller has kindly ascertained"
2009,"for me, vary greatly in thickness; being, on an average of twelve"
2009,"measurements made near the border of the comb, / of an inch in"
2009,"thickness; whereas the basal rhomboidal plates are thicker, nearly in"
2009,"the proportion of three to two, having a mean thickness, from twenty-one"
2009,"measurements, of / of an inch. By the above singular manner of"
2009,"building, strength is continually given to the comb, with the utmost"
2009,ultimate economy of wax.
2009,
2009,It seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the
2009,"cells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee"
2009,"after working a short time at one cell going to another, so that, as"
2009,"Huber has stated, a score of individuals work even at the commencement"
2009,"of the first cell. I was able practically to show this fact, by covering"
2009,"the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the extreme margin"
2009,"of the circumferential rim of a growing comb, with an extremely thin"
2009,layer of melted vermilion wax; and I invariably found that the colour
2009,was most delicately diffused by the bees--as delicately as a painter
2009,could have done it with his brush--by atoms of the coloured wax having
2009,"been taken from the spot on which it had been placed, and worked into"
2009,the growing edges of the cells all round. The work of construction seems
2009,"to be a sort of balance struck between many bees, all instinctively"
2009,"standing at the same relative distance from each other, all trying to"
2009,"sweep equal spheres, and then building up, or leaving ungnawed, the"
2009,planes of intersection between these spheres. It was really curious to
2009,"note in cases of difficulty, as when two pieces of comb met at an angle,"
2009,how often the bees would pull down and rebuild in different ways the
2009,"same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at first"
2009,rejected.
2009,
2009,When bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions
2009,"for working--for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly under the"
2009,"middle of a comb growing downwards, so that the comb has to be built"
2009,over one face of the slip--in this case the bees can lay the foundations
2009,"of one wall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place, projecting"
2009,beyond the other completed cells. It suffices that the bees should be
2009,enabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other
2009,"and from the walls of the last completed cells, and then, by striking"
2009,"imaginary spheres, they can build up a wall intermediate between two"
2009,"adjoining spheres; but, as far as I have seen, they never gnaw away and"
2009,finish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and
2009,of the adjoining cells has been built. This capacity in bees of laying
2009,down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place
2009,"between two just-commenced cells, is important, as it bears on a fact,"
2009,"which seems at first subversive of the foregoing theory; namely, that"
2009,the cells on the extreme margin of wasp-combs are sometimes strictly
2009,hexagonal; but I have not space here to enter on this subject. Nor does
2009,there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect (as in the case
2009,"of a queen-wasp) making hexagonal cells, if she were to work alternately"
2009,on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at the same
2009,"time, always standing at the proper relative distance from the parts"
2009,"of the cells just begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and building up"
2009,intermediate planes.
2009,
2009,As natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight
2009,"modifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the"
2009,"individual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how"
2009,"a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts,"
2009,"all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction, could"
2009,have profited the progenitors of the hive-bee? I think the answer is not
2009,difficult: cells constructed like those of the bee or the wasp gain in
2009,"strength, and save much in labour and space, and in the materials of"
2009,"which they are constructed. With respect to the formation of wax, it is"
2009,known that bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and
2009,I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been experimentally proved
2009,that from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a
2009,hive of bees for the secretion of a pound of wax; so that a prodigious
2009,quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in
2009,a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction
2009,"of their combs. Moreover, many bees have to remain idle for many days"
2009,during the process of secretion. A large store of honey is indispensable
2009,to support a large stock of bees during the winter; and the security
2009,of the hive is known mainly to depend on a large number of bees being
2009,"supported. Hence the saving of wax by largely saving honey, and the"
2009,"time consumed in collecting the honey, must be an important element of"
2009,success any family of bees. Of course the success of the species may
2009,"be dependent on the number of its enemies, or parasites, or on quite"
2009,"distinct causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of"
2009,honey which the bees can collect. But let us suppose that this latter
2009,"circumstance determined, as it probably often has determined, whether"
2009,a bee allied to our humble-bees could exist in large numbers in any
2009,country; and let us further suppose that the community lived through the
2009,"winter, and consequently required a store of honey: there can in"
2009,this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our imaginary
2009,humble-bee if a slight modification of her instincts led her to make her
2009,"waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little; for a wall in"
2009,common even to two adjoining cells would save some little labour and
2009,"wax. Hence, it would continually be more and more advantageous to our"
2009,"humble-bees, if they were to make their cells more and more regular,"
2009,"nearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the cells of the"
2009,Melipona; for in this case a large part of the bounding surface of each
2009,"cell would serve to bound the adjoining cells, and much labour and wax"
2009,"would be saved. Again, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to"
2009,"the Melipona, if she were to make her cells closer together, and more"
2009,"regular in every way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the"
2009,spherical surfaces would wholly disappear and be replaced by plane
2009,surfaces; and the Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of
2009,"the hive-bee. Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, natural"
2009,"selection could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can"
2009,"see, is absolutely perfect in economising labour and wax."
2009,
2009,"Thus, as I believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that"
2009,"of the hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken"
2009,"advantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler"
2009,"instincts; natural selection having, by slow degrees, more and more"
2009,perfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from
2009,"each other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax along"
2009,"the planes of intersection. The bees, of course, no more knowing that"
2009,"they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other,"
2009,than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and
2009,of the basal rhombic plates; the motive power of the process of natural
2009,selection having been the construction of cells of due strength and of
2009,"the proper size and shape for the larvae, this being effected with the"
2009,greatest possible economy of labour and wax; that individual swarm which
2009,"thus made the best cells with least labour, and least waste of honey"
2009,"in the secretion of wax, having succeeded best, and having transmitted"
2009,"their newly-acquired economical instincts to new swarms, which in their"
2009,turn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for
2009,existence.
2009,
2009,OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION AS APPLIED TO INSTINCTS:
2009,NEUTER AND STERILE INSECTS.
2009,
2009,It has been objected to the foregoing view of the origin of instincts
2009,"that ""the variations of structure and of instinct must have been"
2009,"simultaneous and accurately adjusted to each other, as a modification"
2009,in the one without an immediate corresponding change in the other would
2009,"have been fatal."" The force of this objection rests entirely on the"
2009,assumption that the changes in the instincts and structure are abrupt.
2009,"To take as an illustration the case of the larger titmouse, (Parus"
2009,major) alluded to in a previous chapter; this bird often holds the seeds
2009,"of the yew between its feet on a branch, and hammers with its beak till"
2009,it gets at the kernel. Now what special difficulty would there be in
2009,natural selection preserving all the slight individual variations in the
2009,"shape of the beak, which were better and better adapted to break open"
2009,"the seeds, until a beak was formed, as well constructed for this purpose"
2009,"as that of the nuthatch, at the same time that habit, or compulsion, or"
2009,"spontaneous variations of taste, led the bird to become more and more of"
2009,a seed-eater? In this case the beak is supposed to be slowly modified
2009,"by natural selection, subsequently to, but in accordance with, slowly"
2009,changing habits or taste; but let the feet of the titmouse vary and grow
2009,"larger from correlation with the beak, or from any other unknown cause,"
2009,and it is not improbable that such larger feet would lead the bird to
2009,climb more and more until it acquired the remarkable climbing instinct
2009,and power of the nuthatch. In this case a gradual change of structure is
2009,supposed to lead to changed instinctive habits. To take one more case:
2009,few instincts are more remarkable than that which leads the swift of
2009,the Eastern Islands to make its nest wholly of inspissated saliva. Some
2009,"birds build their nests of mud, believed to be moistened with saliva;"
2009,and one of the swifts of North America makes its nest (as I have
2009,"seen) of sticks agglutinated with saliva, and even with flakes of this"
2009,substance. Is it then very improbable that the natural selection of
2009,"individual swifts, which secreted more and more saliva, should at last"
2009,produce a species with instincts leading it to neglect other materials
2009,and to make its nest exclusively of inspissated saliva? And so in other
2009,"cases. It must, however, be admitted that in many instances we cannot"
2009,conjecture whether it was instinct or structure which first varied.
2009,
2009,No doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed
2009,"to the theory of natural selection--cases, in which we cannot see how"
2009,"an instinct could have originated; cases, in which no intermediate"
2009,gradations are known to exist; cases of instincts of such trifling
2009,"importance, that they could hardly have been acted on by natural"
2009,selection; cases of instincts almost identically the same in animals
2009,so remote in the scale of nature that we cannot account for their
2009,"similarity by inheritance from a common progenitor, and consequently"
2009,must believe that they were independently acquired through natural
2009,"selection. I will not here enter on these several cases, but will"
2009,"confine myself to one special difficulty, which at first appeared to"
2009,"me insuperable, and actually fatal to the whole theory. I allude to"
2009,the neuters or sterile females in insect communities: for these neuters
2009,often differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males
2009,"and fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate"
2009,their kind.
2009,
2009,"The subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but I will"
2009,"here take only a single case, that of working or sterile ants. How the"
2009,workers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not much greater
2009,than that of any other striking modification of structure; for it can
2009,be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of
2009,"nature occasionally become sterile; and if such insects had been social,"
2009,and it had been profitable to the community that a number should have
2009,"been annually born capable of work, but incapable of procreation, I can"
2009,see no especial difficulty in this having been effected through natural
2009,selection. But I must pass over this preliminary difficulty. The great
2009,difficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the males
2009,"and the fertile females in structure, as in the shape of the thorax, and"
2009,"in being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes, and in instinct. As"
2009,"far as instinct alone is concerned, the wonderful difference in this"
2009,respect between the workers and the perfect females would have been
2009,better exemplified by the hive-bee. If a working ant or other neuter
2009,"insect had been an ordinary animal, I should have unhesitatingly"
2009,assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired through
2009,"natural selection; namely, by individuals having been born with slight"
2009,"profitable modifications, which were inherited by the offspring, and"
2009,"that these again varied and again were selected, and so onwards. But"
2009,with the working ant we have an insect differing greatly from its
2009,"parents, yet absolutely sterile; so that it could never have transmitted"
2009,successively acquired modifications of structure or instinct to its
2009,progeny. It may well be asked how it is possible to reconcile this case
2009,with the theory of natural selection?
2009,
2009,"First, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in"
2009,"our domestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all sorts"
2009,of differences of inherited structure which are correlated with certain
2009,ages and with either sex. We have differences correlated not only with
2009,"one sex, but with that short period when the reproductive system is"
2009,"active, as in the nuptial plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws"
2009,of the male salmon. We have even slight differences in the horns of
2009,different breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect
2009,state of the male sex; for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than
2009,"the oxen of other breeds, relatively to the length of the horns in"
2009,"both the bulls and cows of these same breeds. Hence, I can see no"
2009,great difficulty in any character becoming correlated with the sterile
2009,condition of certain members of insect communities; the difficulty lies
2009,in understanding how such correlated modifications of structure could
2009,have been slowly accumulated by natural selection.
2009,
2009,"This difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I"
2009,"believe, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied"
2009,"to the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the"
2009,desired end. Breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well
2009,"marbled together. An animal thus characterized has been slaughtered,"
2009,but the breeder has gone with confidence to the same stock and has
2009,succeeded. Such faith may be placed in the power of selection that a
2009,"breed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns,"
2009,"could, it is probable, be formed by carefully watching which individual"
2009,"bulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and"
2009,yet no one ox would ever have propagated its kind. Here is a better and
2009,"real illustration: According to M. Verlot, some varieties of the double"
2009,"annual stock, from having been long and carefully selected to the right"
2009,"degree, always produce a large proportion of seedlings bearing double"
2009,"and quite sterile flowers, but they likewise yield some single and"
2009,"fertile plants. These latter, by which alone the variety can be"
2009,"propagated, may be compared with the fertile male and female ants, and"
2009,the double sterile plants with the neuters of the same community. As
2009,"with the varieties of the stock, so with social insects, selection has"
2009,"been applied to the family, and not to the individual, for the sake"
2009,"of gaining a serviceable end. Hence, we may conclude that slight"
2009,"modifications of structure or of instinct, correlated with the sterile"
2009,"condition of certain members of the community, have proved advantageous;"
2009,"consequently the fertile males and females have flourished, and"
2009,transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to produce sterile
2009,members with the same modifications. This process must have been
2009,"repeated many times, until that prodigious amount of difference between"
2009,the fertile and sterile females of the same species has been produced
2009,which we see in many social insects.
2009,
2009,"But we have not as yet touched on the acme of the difficulty; namely,"
2009,"the fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the"
2009,"fertile females and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost"
2009,"incredible degree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes."
2009,"The castes, moreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but are"
2009,perfectly well defined; being as distinct from each other as are any
2009,"two species of the same genus, or rather as any two genera of the same"
2009,"family. Thus, in Eciton, there are working and soldier neuters, with"
2009,"jaws and instincts extraordinarily different: in Cryptocerus, the"
2009,workers of one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their
2009,"heads, the use of which is quite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus,"
2009,the workers of one caste never leave the nest; they are fed by the
2009,"workers of another caste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen"
2009,"which secretes a sort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted"
2009,"by the aphides, or the domestic cattle as they may be called, which our"
2009,European ants guard and imprison.
2009,
2009,It will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the
2009,"principle of natural selection, when I do not admit that such wonderful"
2009,and well-established facts at once annihilate the theory. In the simpler
2009,"case of neuter insects all of one caste, which, as I believe, have been"
2009,rendered different from the fertile males and females through natural
2009,"selection, we may conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations, that"
2009,"the successive, slight, profitable modifications did not first arise in"
2009,"all the neuters in the same nest, but in some few alone; and that by"
2009,the survival of the communities with females which produced most neuters
2009,"having the advantageous modification, all the neuters ultimately came to"
2009,be thus characterized. According to this view we ought occasionally
2009,"to find in the same nest neuter-insects, presenting gradations of"
2009,"structure; and this we do find, even not rarely, considering how few"
2009,neuter-insects out of Europe have been carefully examined. Mr. F. Smith
2009,has shown that the neuters of several British ants differ surprisingly
2009,from each other in size and sometimes in colour; and that the extreme
2009,forms can be linked together by individuals taken out of the same nest:
2009,I have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind. It sometimes
2009,happens that the larger or the smaller sized workers are the most
2009,"numerous; or that both large and small are numerous, while those of an"
2009,intermediate size are scanty in numbers. Formica flava has larger
2009,"and smaller workers, with some few of intermediate size; and, in this"
2009,"species, as Mr. F. Smith has observed, the larger workers have simple"
2009,"eyes (ocelli), which, though small, can be plainly distinguished,"
2009,whereas the smaller workers have their ocelli rudimentary. Having
2009,"carefully dissected several specimens of these workers, I can affirm"
2009,that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can
2009,be accounted for merely by their proportionately lesser size; and I
2009,"fully believe, though I dare not assert so positively, that the workers"
2009,of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate
2009,condition. So that here we have two bodies of sterile workers in the
2009,"same nest, differing not only in size, but in their organs of vision,"
2009,yet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition. I may
2009,"digress by adding, that if the smaller workers had been the most useful"
2009,"to the community, and those males and females had been continually"
2009,"selected, which produced more and more of the smaller workers, until all"
2009,the workers were in this condition; we should then have had a species of
2009,ant with neuters in nearly the same condition as those of Myrmica. For
2009,"the workers of Myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli, though the"
2009,male and female ants of this genus have well-developed ocelli.
2009,
2009,I may give one other case: so confidently did I expect occasionally to
2009,find gradations of important structures between the different castes
2009,"of neuters in the same species, that I gladly availed myself of Mr. F."
2009,Smith's offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver
2009,ant (Anomma) of West Africa. The reader will perhaps best appreciate
2009,"the amount of difference in these workers by my giving, not the actual"
2009,"measurements, but a strictly accurate illustration: the difference was"
2009,"the same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house, of whom"
2009,"many were five feet four inches high, and many sixteen feet high; but we"
2009,must in addition suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead
2009,"of three times as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws nearly five"
2009,"times as big. The jaws, moreover, of the working ants of the several"
2009,"sizes differed wonderfully in shape, and in the form and number of the"
2009,"teeth. But the important fact for us is that, though the workers can"
2009,"be grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they graduate insensibly"
2009,"into each other, as does the widely-different structure of their jaws. I"
2009,"speak confidently on this latter point, as Sir J. Lubbock made drawings"
2009,"for me, with the camera lucida, of the jaws which I dissected from the"
2009,"workers of the several sizes. Mr. Bates, in his interesting ""Naturalist"
2009,"on the Amazons,"" has described analogous cases."
2009,
2009,"With these facts before me, I believe that natural selection, by acting"
2009,"on the fertile ants or parents, could form a species which should"
2009,"regularly produce neuters, all of large size with one form of jaw, or"
2009,"all of small size with widely different jaws; or lastly, and this is the"
2009,"greatest difficulty, one set of workers of one size and structure, and"
2009,simultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structure;
2009,"a graduated series having first been formed, as in the case of the"
2009,"driver ant, and then the extreme forms having been produced in greater"
2009,"and greater numbers, through the survival of the parents which generated"
2009,"them, until none with an intermediate structure were produced."
2009,
2009,"An analogous explanation has been given by Mr. Wallace, of the equally"
2009,"complex case, of certain Malayan butterflies regularly appearing under"
2009,"two or even three distinct female forms; and by Fritz Muller, of certain"
2009,Brazilian crustaceans likewise appearing under two widely distinct male
2009,forms. But this subject need not here be discussed.
2009,
2009,"I have now explained how, I believe, the wonderful fact of two"
2009,distinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same
2009,"nest, both widely different from each other and from their parents, has"
2009,originated. We can see how useful their production may have been to a
2009,"social community of ants, on the same principle that the division of"
2009,"labour is useful to civilised man. Ants, however, work by inherited"
2009,"instincts and by inherited organs or tools, while man works by acquired"
2009,"knowledge and manufactured instruments. But I must confess, that, with"
2009,"all my faith in natural selection, I should never have anticipated that"
2009,"this principle could have been efficient in so high a degree, had not"
2009,"the case of these neuter insects led me to this conclusion. I have,"
2009,"therefore, discussed this case, at some little but wholly insufficient"
2009,"length, in order to show the power of natural selection, and likewise"
2009,because this is by far the most serious special difficulty which my
2009,"theory has encountered. The case, also, is very interesting, as it"
2009,"proves that with animals, as with plants, any amount of modification"
2009,"may be effected by the accumulation of numerous, slight, spontaneous"
2009,"variations, which are in any way profitable, without exercise or habit"
2009,"having been brought into play. For peculiar habits, confined to the"
2009,"workers of sterile females, however long they might be followed, could"
2009,"not possibly affect the males and fertile females, which alone leave"
2009,descendants. I am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative
2009,"case of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of inherited"
2009,"habit, as advanced by Lamarck."
2009,
2009,SUMMARY.
2009,
2009,I have endeavoured in this chapter briefly to show that the mental
2009,"qualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations are"
2009,inherited. Still more briefly I have attempted to show that instincts
2009,vary slightly in a state of nature. No one will dispute that instincts
2009,"are of the highest importance to each animal. Therefore, there is no"
2009,"real difficulty, under changing conditions of life, in natural selection"
2009,accumulating to any extent slight modifications of instinct which are in
2009,any way useful. In many cases habit or use and disuse have probably
2009,come into play. I do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter
2009,strengthen in any great degree my theory; but none of the cases of
2009,"difficulty, to the best of my judgment, annihilate it. On the other"
2009,"hand, the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and are"
2009,liable to mistakes; that no instinct can be shown to have been produced
2009,"for the good of other animals, though animals take advantage of the"
2009,"instincts of others; that the canon in natural history, of ""Natura"
2009,"non facit saltum,"" is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal"
2009,"structure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is"
2009,otherwise inexplicable--all tend to corroborate the theory of natural
2009,selection.
2009,
2009,This theory is also strengthened by some few other facts in regard
2009,"to instincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but distinct,"
2009,"species, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living under"
2009,"considerably different conditions of life, yet often retaining nearly"
2009,"the same instincts. For instance, we can understand, on the principle of"
2009,"inheritance, how it is that the thrush of tropical South America lines"
2009,"its nest with mud, in the same peculiar manner as does our British"
2009,thrush; how it is that the Hornbills of Africa and India have the same
2009,extraordinary instinct of plastering up and imprisoning the females in a
2009,"hole in a tree, with only a small hole left in the plaster through which"
2009,the males feed them and their young when hatched; how it is that the
2009,"male wrens (Troglodytes) of North America, build ""cock-nests,"" to roost"
2009,"in, like the males of our Kitty-wrens,--a habit wholly unlike that of"
2009,"any other known bird. Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to"
2009,my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as
2009,"the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, ants making slaves, the"
2009,"larvae of ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars,"
2009,"not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences"
2009,of one general law leading to the advancement of all organic
2009,"beings--namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest"
2009,die.

2009,
2009,
2009,"The view commonly entertained by naturalists is that species, when"
2009,"intercrossed, have been specially endowed with sterility, in order"
2009,to prevent their confusion. This view certainly seems at first highly
2009,"probable, for species living together could hardly have been kept"
2009,distinct had they been capable of freely crossing. The subject is in
2009,"many ways important for us, more especially as the sterility of species"
2009,"when first crossed, and that of their hybrid offspring, cannot have been"
2009,"acquired, as I shall show, by the preservation of successive profitable"
2009,degrees of sterility. It is an incidental result of differences in the
2009,reproductive systems of the parent-species.
2009,
2009,"In treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent"
2009,"fundamentally different, have generally been confounded; namely, the"
2009,"sterility of species when first crossed, and the sterility of the"
2009,hybrids produced from them.
2009,
2009,Pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect
2009,"condition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no"
2009,"offspring. Hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive organs"
2009,"functionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of the"
2009,male element in both plants and animals; though the formative organs
2009,"themselves are perfect in structure, as far as the microscope reveals."
2009,In the first case the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo
2009,"are perfect; in the second case they are either not at all developed, or"
2009,"are imperfectly developed. This distinction is important, when the"
2009,"cause of the sterility, which is common to the two cases, has to be"
2009,"considered. The distinction probably has been slurred over, owing to the"
2009,"sterility in both cases being looked on as a special endowment, beyond"
2009,the province of our reasoning powers.
2009,
2009,"The fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or believed to be"
2009,"descended from common parents, when crossed, and likewise the fertility"
2009,"of their mongrel offspring, is, with reference to my theory, of equal"
2009,importance with the sterility of species; for it seems to make a broad
2009,and clear distinction between varieties and species.
2009,
2009,DEGREES OF STERILITY.
2009,
2009,"First, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid"
2009,offspring. It is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of
2009,"those two conscientious and admirable observers, Kolreuter and Gartner,"
2009,"who almost devoted their lives to this subject, without being deeply"
2009,impressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility.
2009,"Kolreuter makes the rule universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in"
2009,"ten cases in which he found two forms, considered by most authors as"
2009,"distinct species, quite fertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks them"
2009,"as varieties. Gartner, also, makes the rule equally universal; and he"
2009,disputes the entire fertility of Kolreuter's ten cases. But in these and
2009,"in many other cases, Gartner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in"
2009,order to show that there is any degree of sterility. He always compares
2009,"the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when first crossed,"
2009,"and the maximum produced by their hybrid offspring, with the average"
2009,number produced by both pure parent-species in a state of nature. But
2009,"causes of serious error here intervene: a plant, to be hybridised, must"
2009,"be castrated, and, what is often more important, must be secluded"
2009,in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by insects from other
2009,"plants. Nearly all the plants experimented on by Gartner were potted,"
2009,and were kept in a chamber in his house. That these processes are often
2009,injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted; for Gartner
2009,"gives in his table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated,"
2009,"and artificially fertilised with their own pollen, and (excluding"
2009,"all cases such as the Leguminosae, in which there is an acknowledged"
2009,difficulty in the manipulation) half of these twenty plants had their
2009,"fertility in some degree impaired. Moreover, as Gartner repeatedly"
2009,"crossed some forms, such as the common red and blue pimpernels"
2009,"(Anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the best botanists rank as"
2009,"varieties, and found them absolutely sterile, we may doubt whether many"
2009,"species are really so sterile, when intercrossed, as he believed."
2009,
2009,"It is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species"
2009,"when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly,"
2009,"and, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species is so easily"
2009,"affected by various circumstances, that for all practical purposes it is"
2009,most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins.
2009,I think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two
2009,"most experienced observers who have ever lived, namely Kolreuter and"
2009,"Gartner, arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to some"
2009,of the very same forms. It is also most instructive to compare--but I
2009,have not space here to enter on details--the evidence advanced by our
2009,best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be
2009,"ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced"
2009,"by different hybridisers, or by the same observer from experiments made"
2009,during different years. It can thus be shown that neither sterility nor
2009,fertility affords any certain distinction between species and varieties.
2009,"The evidence from this source graduates away, and is doubtful in the"
2009,same degree as is the evidence derived from other constitutional and
2009,structural differences.
2009,
2009,In regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though
2009,"Gartner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from a"
2009,"cross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for"
2009,"ten generations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never"
2009,"increases, but generally decreases greatly and suddenly. With respect"
2009,"to this decrease, it may first be noticed that when any deviation in"
2009,"structure or constitution is common to both parents, this is often"
2009,transmitted in an augmented degree to the offspring; and both sexual
2009,elements in hybrid plants are already affected in some degree. But I
2009,believe that their fertility has been diminished in nearly all these
2009,"cases by an independent cause, namely, by too close interbreeding. I"
2009,"have made so many experiments and collected so many facts, showing on"
2009,the one hand that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or
2009,"variety increases the vigour and fertility of the offspring, and on"
2009,the other hand that very close interbreeding lessens their vigour and
2009,"fertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this conclusion."
2009,Hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and as
2009,"the parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same"
2009,"garden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the"
2009,"flowering season: hence hybrids, if left to themselves, will generally"
2009,be fertilised during each generation by pollen from the same flower; and
2009,"this would probably be injurious to their fertility, already lessened"
2009,by their hybrid origin. I am strengthened in this conviction by a
2009,"remarkable statement repeatedly made by Gartner, namely, that if even"
2009,the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen
2009,"of the same kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill"
2009,"effects from manipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on"
2009,"increasing. Now, in the process of artificial fertilisation, pollen is"
2009,as often taken by chance (as I know from my own experience) from the
2009,"anthers of another flower, as from the anthers of the flower itself"
2009,"which is to be fertilised; so that a cross between two flowers, though"
2009,"probably often on the same plant, would be thus effected. Moreover,"
2009,"whenever complicated experiments are in progress, so careful an observer"
2009,"as Gartner would have castrated his hybrids, and this would have insured"
2009,"in each generation a cross with pollen from a distinct flower, either"
2009,from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature.
2009,"And thus, the strange fact of an increase of fertility in the successive"
2009,"generations of ARTIFICIALLY FERTILISED hybrids, in contrast with those"
2009,"spontaneously self-fertilised, may, as I believe, be accounted for by"
2009,too close interbreeding having been avoided.
2009,
2009,Now let us turn to the results arrived at by a third most experienced
2009,"hybridiser, namely, the Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert. He is as emphatic in"
2009,his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile--as fertile as
2009,the pure parent-species--as are Kolreuter and Gartner that some degree
2009,of sterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature.
2009,He experimented on some of the very same species as did Gartner. The
2009,"difference in their results may, I think, be in part accounted for by"
2009,"Herbert's great horticultural skill, and by his having hot-houses at his"
2009,command. Of his many important statements I will here give only a single
2009,"one as an example, namely, that ""every ovule in a pod of Crinum capense"
2009,"fertilised by C. revolutum produced a plant, which I never saw to occur"
2009,"in a case of its natural fecundation."" So that here we have perfect, or"
2009,"even more than commonly perfect fertility, in a first cross between two"
2009,distinct species.
2009,
2009,"This case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a singular fact, namely,"
2009,"that individual plants of certain species of Lobelia, Verbascum and"
2009,"Passiflora, can easily be fertilised by the pollen from a distinct"
2009,"species, but not by pollen from the same plant, though this pollen can"
2009,be proved to be perfectly sound by fertilising other plants or species.
2009,"In the genus Hippeastrum, in Corydalis as shown by Professor Hildebrand,"
2009,"in various orchids as shown by Mr. Scott and Fritz Muller, all the"
2009,"individuals are in this peculiar condition. So that with some species,"
2009,"certain abnormal individuals, and in other species all the individuals,"
2009,can actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be fertilised
2009,"by pollen from the same individual plant! To give one instance, a bulb"
2009,of Hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers; three were fertilised
2009,"by Herbert with their own pollen, and the fourth was subsequently"
2009,fertilised by the pollen of a compound hybrid descended from three
2009,"distinct species: the result was that ""the ovaries of the three first"
2009,"flowers soon ceased to grow, and after a few days perished entirely,"
2009,whereas the pod impregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous
2009,"growth and rapid progress to maturity, and bore good seed, which"
2009,"vegetated freely."" Mr. Herbert tried similar experiments during many"
2009,"years, and always with the same result. These cases serve to show on"
2009,what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of a
2009,species sometimes depends.
2009,
2009,"The practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with"
2009,"scientific precision, deserve some notice. It is notorious in how"
2009,"complicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia, Calceolaria,"
2009,"Petunia, Rhododendron, etc., have been crossed, yet many of these"
2009,"hybrids seed freely. For instance, Herbert asserts that a hybrid from"
2009,"Calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely dissimilar"
2009,"in general habit, ""reproduces itself as perfectly as if it had been a"
2009,"natural species from the mountains of Chile."" I have taken some pains"
2009,to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of
2009,"Rhododendrons, and I am assured that many of them are perfectly fertile."
2009,"Mr. C. Noble, for instance, informs me that he raises stocks for"
2009,"grafting from a hybrid between Rhod. ponticum and catawbiense, and that"
2009,"this hybrid ""seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine."" Had hybrids,"
2009,"when fairly treated, always gone on decreasing in fertility in each"
2009,"successive generation, as Gartner believed to be the case, the fact"
2009,would have been notorious to nurserymen. Horticulturists raise large
2009,"beds of the same hybrid, and such alone are fairly treated, for by"
2009,insect agency the several individuals are allowed to cross freely with
2009,"each other, and the injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus"
2009,prevented. Any one may readily convince himself of the efficiency of
2009,insect agency by examining the flowers of the more sterile kinds of
2009,"hybrid Rhododendrons, which produce no pollen, for he will find on their"
2009,stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers.
2009,
2009,"In regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully tried"
2009,"than with plants. If our systematic arrangements can be trusted, that"
2009,"is, if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other as are the"
2009,"genera of plants, then we may infer that animals more widely distinct"
2009,in the scale of nature can be crossed more easily than in the case
2009,"of plants; but the hybrids themselves are, I think, more sterile. It"
2009,"should, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few animals breeding"
2009,"freely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly tried: for"
2009,"instance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine distinct species of"
2009,"finches, but, as not one of these breeds freely in confinement, we have"
2009,"no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the canary,"
2009,"or that their hybrids, should be perfectly fertile. Again, with respect"
2009,to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid
2009,"animals, I hardly know of an instance in which two families of the same"
2009,"hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents, so"
2009,"as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. On the contrary,"
2009,brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each successive
2009,"generation, in opposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every"
2009,"breeder. And in this case, it is not at all surprising that the inherent"
2009,sterility in the hybrids should have gone on increasing.
2009,
2009,Although I know of hardly any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of
2009,"perfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have reason to believe that the"
2009,"hybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii, and from Phasianus"
2009,"colchicus with P. torquatus, are perfectly fertile. M. Quatrefages"
2009,states that the hybrids from two moths (Bombyx cynthia and arrindia)
2009,were proved in Paris to be fertile inter se for eight generations. It
2009,has lately been asserted that two such distinct species as the hare and
2009,"rabbit, when they can be got to breed together, produce offspring, which"
2009,are highly fertile when crossed with one of the parent-species. The
2009,"hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A. cygnoides), species which"
2009,"are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera, have"
2009,"often bred in this country with either pure parent, and in one single"
2009,"instance they have bred inter se. This was effected by Mr. Eyton, who"
2009,"raised two hybrids from the same parents, but from different hatches;"
2009,and from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids
2009,"(grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. In India, however,"
2009,these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am assured by
2009,"two eminently capable judges, namely Mr. Blyth and Captain Hutton, that"
2009,whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of
2009,"the country; and as they are kept for profit, where neither pure"
2009,"parent-species exists, they must certainly be highly or perfectly"
2009,fertile.
2009,
2009,"With our domesticated animals, the various races when crossed together"
2009,are quite fertile; yet in many cases they are descended from two or more
2009,wild species. From this fact we must conclude either that the aboriginal
2009,"parent-species at first produced perfectly fertile hybrids, or that the"
2009,hybrids subsequently reared under domestication became quite fertile.
2009,"This latter alternative, which was first propounded by Pallas, seems by"
2009,"far the most probable, and can, indeed, hardly be doubted. It is, for"
2009,"instance, almost certain that our dogs are descended from several wild"
2009,"stocks; yet, with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic"
2009,"dogs of South America, all are quite fertile together; but analogy makes"
2009,"me greatly doubt, whether the several aboriginal species would at first"
2009,have freely bred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids.
2009,So again I have lately acquired decisive evidence that the crossed
2009,offspring from the Indian humped and common cattle are inter se
2009,perfectly fertile; and from the observations by Rutimeyer on their
2009,"important osteological differences, as well as from those by Mr. Blyth"
2009,"on their differences in habits, voice, constitution, etc., these two"
2009,forms must be regarded as good and distinct species. The same remarks
2009,"may be extended to the two chief races of the pig. We must, therefore,"
2009,either give up the belief of the universal sterility of species when
2009,"crossed; or we must look at this sterility in animals, not as an"
2009,"indelible characteristic, but as one capable of being removed by"
2009,domestication.
2009,
2009,"Finally, considering all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of"
2009,"plants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of sterility,"
2009,"both in first crosses and in hybrids, is an extremely general result;"
2009,"but that it cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered"
2009,as absolutely universal.
2009,
2009,LAWS GOVERNING THE STERILITY OF FIRST CROSSES AND OF HYBRIDS.
2009,
2009,We will now consider a little more in detail the laws governing the
2009,sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. Our chief object will be to
2009,see whether or not these laws indicate that species have been specially
2009,"endowed with this quality, in order to prevent their crossing and"
2009,blending together in utter confusion. The following conclusions are
2009,drawn up chiefly from Gartner's admirable work on the hybridisation
2009,of plants. I have taken much pains to ascertain how far they apply
2009,"to animals, and, considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to"
2009,"hybrid animals, I have been surprised to find how generally the same"
2009,rules apply to both kingdoms.
2009,
2009,"It has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of"
2009,"first crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect fertility."
2009,It is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown;
2009,but only the barest outline of the facts can here be given. When pollen
2009,from a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a
2009,"distinct family, it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic"
2009,"dust. From this absolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different"
2009,"species applied to the stigma of some one species of the same genus,"
2009,"yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced, up to nearly"
2009,"complete or even quite complete fertility; and, as we have seen, in"
2009,"certain abnormal cases, even to an excess of fertility, beyond that"
2009,"which the plant's own pollen produces. So in hybrids themselves, there"
2009,"are some which never have produced, and probably never would produce,"
2009,"even with the pollen of the pure parents, a single fertile seed: but in"
2009,"some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected, by"
2009,the pollen of one of the pure parent-species causing the flower of the
2009,hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have done; and the
2009,early withering of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient
2009,fertilisation. From this extreme degree of sterility we have
2009,self-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of seeds
2009,up to perfect fertility.
2009,
2009,"The hybrids raised from two species which are very difficult to cross,"
2009,"and which rarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but"
2009,"the parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the"
2009,sterility of the hybrids thus produced--two classes of facts which are
2009,generally confounded together--is by no means strict. There are many
2009,"cases, in which two pure species, as in the genus Verbascum, can be"
2009,"united with unusual facility, and produce numerous hybrid offspring,"
2009,"yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile. On the other hand, there are"
2009,"species which can be crossed very rarely, or with extreme difficulty,"
2009,"but the hybrids, when at last produced, are very fertile. Even within"
2009,"the limits of the same genus, for instance in Dianthus, these two"
2009,opposite cases occur.
2009,
2009,"The fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more easily"
2009,"affected by unfavourable conditions, than is that of pure species. But"
2009,the fertility of first crosses is likewise innately variable; for it
2009,is not always the same in degree when the same two species are crossed
2009,under the same circumstances; it depends in part upon the constitution
2009,of the individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment.
2009,"So it is with hybrids, for their degree of fertility is often found to"
2009,differ greatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the
2009,same capsule and exposed to the same conditions.
2009,
2009,"By the term systematic affinity is meant, the general resemblance"
2009,between species in structure and constitution. Now the fertility
2009,"of first crosses, and of the hybrids produced from them, is largely"
2009,governed by their systematic affinity. This is clearly shown by hybrids
2009,never having been raised between species ranked by systematists in
2009,"distinct families; and on the other hand, by very closely allied"
2009,species generally uniting with facility. But the correspondence between
2009,systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict.
2009,A multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species which
2009,"will not unite, or only with extreme difficulty; and on the other hand"
2009,of very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility. In
2009,"the same family there may be a genus, as Dianthus, in which very many"
2009,"species can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as Silene,"
2009,in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between
2009,extremely close species a single hybrid. Even within the limits of the
2009,"same genus, we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many"
2009,species of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of
2009,"almost any other genus; but Gartner found that N. acuminata, which is"
2009,"not a particularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or"
2009,"to be fertilised, by no less than eight other species of Nicotiana. Many"
2009,analogous facts could be given.
2009,
2009,No one has been able to point out what kind or what amount of
2009,"difference, in any recognisable character, is sufficient to prevent two"
2009,species crossing. It can be shown that plants most widely different in
2009,"habit and general appearance, and having strongly marked differences in"
2009,"every part of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in the"
2009,"cotyledons, can be crossed. Annual and perennial plants, deciduous and"
2009,"evergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for"
2009,"extremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease."
2009,
2009,"By a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for"
2009,"instance, of a female-ass being first crossed by a stallion, and then"
2009,a mare by a male-ass: these two species may then be said to have been
2009,reciprocally crossed. There is often the widest possible difference
2009,in the facility of making reciprocal crosses. Such cases are highly
2009,"important, for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross"
2009,"is often completely independent of their systematic affinity, that is"
2009,"of any difference in their structure or constitution, excepting in their"
2009,reproductive systems. The diversity of the result in reciprocal crosses
2009,between the same two species was long ago observed by Kolreuter. To give
2009,an instance: Mirabilis jalapa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of
2009,"M. longiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile;"
2009,"but Kolreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight following"
2009,"years, to fertilise reciprocally M. longiflora with the pollen of M."
2009,"jalapa, and utterly failed. Several other equally striking cases could"
2009,be given. Thuret has observed the same fact with certain sea-weeds
2009,"or Fuci. Gartner, moreover, found that this difference of facility in"
2009,making reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree. He has
2009,observed it even between closely related forms (as Matthiola annua
2009,and glabra) which many botanists rank only as varieties. It is also a
2009,"remarkable fact that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though of"
2009,"course compounded of the very same two species, the one species having"
2009,"first been used as the father and then as the mother, though they rarely"
2009,"differ in external characters, yet generally differ in fertility in a"
2009,"small, and occasionally in a high degree."
2009,
2009,"Several other singular rules could be given from Gartner: for instance,"
2009,some species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species;
2009,other species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing
2009,their likeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two powers do not at
2009,"all necessarily go together. There are certain hybrids which, instead"
2009,"of having, as is usual, an intermediate character between their two"
2009,"parents, always closely resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though"
2009,"externally so like one of their pure parent-species, are with rare"
2009,exceptions extremely sterile. So again among hybrids which are usually
2009,"intermediate in structure between their parents, exceptional and"
2009,"abnormal individuals sometimes are born, which closely resemble one of"
2009,"their pure parents; and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile,"
2009,even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have
2009,a considerable degree of fertility. These facts show how completely the
2009,fertility of a hybrid may be independent of its external resemblance to
2009,either pure parent.
2009,
2009,"Considering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility"
2009,"of first crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be"
2009,"considered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility"
2009,"graduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under"
2009,"certain conditions in excess; that their fertility, besides being"
2009,"eminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is"
2009,innately variable; that it is by no means always the same in degree in
2009,the first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross; that the
2009,fertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble
2009,"in external appearance either parent; and lastly, that the facility of"
2009,making a first cross between any two species is not always governed by
2009,their systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other. This
2009,latter statement is clearly proved by the difference in the result of
2009,"reciprocal crosses between the same two species, for, according as the"
2009,"one species or the other is used as the father or the mother, there"
2009,"is generally some difference, and occasionally the widest possible"
2009,"difference, in the facility of effecting an union. The hybrids,"
2009,"moreover, produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility."
2009,
2009,Now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been
2009,endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded
2009,in nature? I think not. For why should the sterility be so extremely
2009,"different in degree, when various species are crossed, all of which"
2009,we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending
2009,together? Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in
2009,the individuals of the same species? Why should some species cross with
2009,facility and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and other species cross
2009,"with extreme difficulty, and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids?"
2009,Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a
2009,"reciprocal cross between the same two species? Why, it may even be"
2009,"asked, has the production of hybrids been permitted? To grant to species"
2009,"the special power of producing hybrids, and then to stop their further"
2009,"propagation by different degrees of sterility, not strictly related to"
2009,"the facility of the first union between their parents, seems a strange"
2009,arrangement.
2009,
2009,"The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me clearly"
2009,"to indicate that the sterility, both of first crosses and of hybrids,"
2009,is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences in their
2009,reproductive systems; the differences being of so peculiar and limited
2009,"a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses between the same two species,"
2009,the male sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female
2009,"sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed direction. It will be"
2009,"advisable to explain a little more fully, by an example, what I mean"
2009,"by sterility being incidental on other differences, and not a specially"
2009,endowed quality. As the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on
2009,"another is unimportant for their welfare in a state of nature, I presume"
2009,that no one will suppose that this capacity is a SPECIALLY endowed
2009,"quality, but will admit that it is incidental on differences in the laws"
2009,of growth of the two plants. We can sometimes see the reason why one
2009,"tree will not take on another from differences in their rate of growth,"
2009,"in the hardness of their wood, in the period of the flow or nature of"
2009,"their sap, etc.; but in a multitude of cases we can assign no reason"
2009,"whatever. Great diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody and"
2009,"the other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous, and"
2009,"adaptation to widely different climates, does not always prevent the two"
2009,"grafting together. As in hybridisation, so with grafting, the capacity"
2009,"is limited by systematic affinity, for no one has been able to graft"
2009,"together trees belonging to quite distinct families; and, on the other"
2009,"hand, closely allied species and varieties of the same species, can"
2009,"usually, but not invariably, be grafted with ease. But this capacity,"
2009,"as in hybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed by systematic"
2009,affinity. Although many distinct genera within the same family have been
2009,"grafted together, in other cases species of the same genus will not take"
2009,"on each other. The pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince,"
2009,"which is ranked as a distinct genus, than on the apple, which is a"
2009,member of the same genus. Even different varieties of the pear take with
2009,different degrees of facility on the quince; so do different varieties
2009,of the apricot and peach on certain varieties of the plum.
2009,
2009,As Gartner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in
2009,different INDIVIDUALS of the same two species in crossing; so Sagaret
2009,believes this to be the case with different individuals of the same
2009,"two species in being grafted together. As in reciprocal crosses, the"
2009,"facility of effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it"
2009,"sometimes is in grafting. The common gooseberry, for instance, cannot"
2009,"be grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with"
2009,"difficulty, on the gooseberry."
2009,
2009,We have seen that the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive
2009,"organs in an imperfect condition, is a different case from the"
2009,"difficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their reproductive"
2009,organs perfect; yet these two distinct classes of cases run to a large
2009,extent parallel. Something analogous occurs in grafting; for Thouin
2009,"found that three species of Robinia, which seeded freely on their own"
2009,"roots, and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on a fourth"
2009,"species, when thus grafted were rendered barren. On the other hand,"
2009,"certain species of Sorbus, when grafted on other species, yielded twice"
2009,as much fruit as when on their own roots. We are reminded by this latter
2009,"fact of the extraordinary cases of Hippeastrum, Passiflora, etc., which"
2009,seed much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of a distinct
2009,species than when fertilised with pollen from the same plant.
2009,
2009,"We thus see that, although there is a clear and great difference between"
2009,the mere adhesion of grafted stocks and the union of the male and female
2009,"elements in the act of reproduction, yet that there is a rude degree of"
2009,parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species.
2009,And as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the
2009,facility with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on
2009,"unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so I believe that the"
2009,still more complex laws governing the facility of first crosses are
2009,incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. These
2009,"differences in both cases follow, to a certain extent, as might"
2009,"have been expected, systematic affinity, by which term every kind of"
2009,resemblance and dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be
2009,expressed. The facts by no means seem to indicate that the greater or
2009,lesser difficulty of either grafting or crossing various species
2009,"has been a special endowment; although in the case of crossing, the"
2009,difficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific
2009,forms as in the case of grafting it is unimportant for their welfare.
2009,
2009,ORIGIN AND CAUSES OF THE STERILITY OF FIRST CROSSES AND OF HYBRIDS.
2009,
2009,"At one time it appeared to me probable, as it has to others, that"
2009,the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids might have been slowly
2009,acquired through the natural selection of slightly lessened degrees of
2009,"fertility, which, like any other variation, spontaneously appeared in"
2009,certain individuals of one variety when crossed with those of another
2009,variety. For it would clearly be advantageous to two varieties or
2009,"incipient species if they could be kept from blending, on the same"
2009,"principle that, when man is selecting at the same time two varieties, it"
2009,"is necessary that he should keep them separate. In the first place,"
2009,it may be remarked that species inhabiting distinct regions are often
2009,sterile when crossed; now it could clearly have been of no advantage
2009,"to such separated species to have been rendered mutually sterile,"
2009,and consequently this could not have been effected through natural
2009,"selection; but it may perhaps be argued, that, if a species was rendered"
2009,"sterile with some one compatriot, sterility with other species would"
2009,"follow as a necessary contingency. In the second place, it is almost as"
2009,much opposed to the theory of natural selection as to that of special
2009,"creation, that in reciprocal crosses the male element of one form should"
2009,"have been rendered utterly impotent on a second form, while at the same"
2009,time the male element of this second form is enabled freely to fertilise
2009,the first form; for this peculiar state of the reproductive system could
2009,hardly have been advantageous to either species.
2009,
2009,In considering the probability of natural selection having come into
2009,"action, in rendering species mutually sterile, the greatest difficulty"
2009,"will be found to lie in the existence of many graduated steps, from"
2009,slightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility. It may be admitted
2009,"that it would profit an incipient species, if it were rendered in some"
2009,slight degree sterile when crossed with its parent form or with some
2009,other variety; for thus fewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring
2009,would be produced to commingle their blood with the new species in
2009,process of formation. But he who will take the trouble to reflect on the
2009,steps by which this first degree of sterility could be increased through
2009,natural selection to that high degree which is common with so
2009,"many species, and which is universal with species which have been"
2009,"differentiated to a generic or family rank, will find the subject"
2009,"extraordinarily complex. After mature reflection, it seems to me that"
2009,this could not have been effected through natural selection. Take the
2009,"case of any two species which, when crossed, produced few and sterile"
2009,"offspring; now, what is there which could favour the survival of those"
2009,individuals which happened to be endowed in a slightly higher degree
2009,"with mutual infertility, and which thus approached by one small step"
2009,"towards absolute sterility? Yet an advance of this kind, if the theory"
2009,"of natural selection be brought to bear, must have incessantly occurred"
2009,"with many species, for a multitude are mutually quite barren. With"
2009,sterile neuter insects we have reason to believe that modifications in
2009,their structure and fertility have been slowly accumulated by natural
2009,"selection, from an advantage having been thus indirectly given to the"
2009,community to which they belonged over other communities of the same
2009,"species; but an individual animal not belonging to a social community,"
2009,"if rendered slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety, would"
2009,not thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any advantage
2009,"to the other individuals of the same variety, thus leading to their"
2009,preservation.
2009,
2009,But it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail: for with
2009,plants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of crossed species
2009,"must be due to some principle, quite independent of natural selection."
2009,Both Gartner and Kolreuter have proved that in genera including numerous
2009,"species, a series can be formed from species which when crossed yield"
2009,"fewer and fewer seeds, to species which never produce a single seed, but"
2009,"yet are affected by the pollen of certain other species, for the germen"
2009,swells. It is here manifestly impossible to select the more sterile
2009,"individuals, which have already ceased to yield seeds; so that this acme"
2009,"of sterility, when the germen alone is effected, cannot have been gained"
2009,through selection; and from the laws governing the various grades of
2009,"sterility being so uniform throughout the animal and vegetable kingdoms,"
2009,"we may infer that the cause, whatever it may be, is the same or nearly"
2009,the same in all cases.
2009,
2009,We will now look a little closer at the probable nature of the
2009,differences between species which induce sterility in first crosses and
2009,"in hybrids. In the case of first crosses, the greater or less difficulty"
2009,in effecting a union and in obtaining offspring apparently depends
2009,on several distinct causes. There must sometimes be a physical
2009,"impossibility in the male element reaching the ovule, as would be the"
2009,case with a plant having a pistil too long for the pollen-tubes to
2009,reach the ovarium. It has also been observed that when the pollen of one
2009,"species is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species, though"
2009,"the pollen-tubes protrude, they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface."
2009,"Again, the male element may reach the female element, but be incapable"
2009,"of causing an embryo to be developed, as seems to have been the case"
2009,with some of Thuret's experiments on Fuci. No explanation can be given
2009,"of these facts, any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on"
2009,"others. Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and then perish at an early"
2009,period. This latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended to;
2009,"but I believe, from observations communicated to me by Mr. Hewitt, who"
2009,"has had great experience in hybridising pheasants and fowls, that the"
2009,early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first
2009,crosses. Mr. Salter has recently given the results of an examination of
2009,about  eggs produced from various crosses between three species
2009,of Gallus and their hybrids; the majority of these eggs had been
2009,"fertilised; and in the majority of the fertilised eggs, the embryos had"
2009,"either been partially developed and had then perished, or had become"
2009,"nearly mature, but the young chickens had been unable to break through"
2009,"the shell. Of the chickens which were born, more than four-fifths died"
2009,"within the first few days, or at latest weeks, ""without any obvious"
2009,"cause, apparently from mere inability to live;"" so that from the "
2009,"eggs only twelve chickens were reared. With plants, hybridized embryos"
2009,probably often perish in a like manner; at least it is known that
2009,hybrids raised from very distinct species are sometimes weak and
2009,"dwarfed, and perish at an early age; of which fact Max Wichura has"
2009,recently given some striking cases with hybrid willows. It may be here
2009,"worth noticing that in some cases of parthenogenesis, the embryos within"
2009,"the eggs of silk moths which had not been fertilised, pass through their"
2009,early stages of development and then perish like the embryos produced by
2009,a cross between distinct species. Until becoming acquainted with these
2009,"facts, I was unwilling to believe in the frequent early death of"
2009,"hybrid embryos; for hybrids, when once born, are generally healthy and"
2009,"long-lived, as we see in the case of the common mule. Hybrids, however,"
2009,are differently circumstanced before and after birth: when born and
2009,"living in a country where their two parents live, they are generally"
2009,placed under suitable conditions of life. But a hybrid partakes of only
2009,"half of the nature and constitution of its mother; it may therefore,"
2009,"before birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother's womb, or"
2009,"within the egg or seed produced by the mother, be exposed to conditions"
2009,"in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to perish at an"
2009,early period; more especially as all very young beings are eminently
2009,"sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life. But after all,"
2009,the cause more probably lies in some imperfection in the original act
2009,"of impregnation, causing the embryo to be imperfectly developed, rather"
2009,than in the conditions to which it is subsequently exposed.
2009,
2009,"In regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are"
2009,"imperfectly developed, the case is somewhat different. I have more than"
2009,"once alluded to a large body of facts showing that, when animals and"
2009,"plants are removed from their natural conditions, they are extremely"
2009,"liable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected. This,"
2009,"in fact, is the great bar to the domestication of animals. Between the"
2009,"sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids, there are many points"
2009,of similarity. In both cases the sterility is independent of general
2009,"health, and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance."
2009,"In both cases the sterility occurs in various degrees; in both, the male"
2009,element is the most liable to be affected; but sometimes the female
2009,"more than the male. In both, the tendency goes to a certain extent with"
2009,"systematic affinity, for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered"
2009,impotent by the same unnatural conditions; and whole groups of species
2009,"tend to produce sterile hybrids. On the other hand, one species in a"
2009,group will sometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired
2009,fertility; and certain species in a group will produce unusually fertile
2009,"hybrids. No one can tell till he tries, whether any particular animal"
2009,"will breed under confinement, or any exotic plant seed freely under"
2009,"culture; nor can he tell till he tries, whether any two species of a"
2009,"genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids. Lastly, when organic"
2009,beings are placed during several generations under conditions not
2009,"natural to them, they are extremely liable to vary, which seems to be"
2009,"partly due to their reproductive systems having been specially affected,"
2009,though in a lesser degree than when sterility ensues. So it is with
2009,"hybrids, for their offspring in successive generations are eminently"
2009,"liable to vary, as every experimentalist has observed."
2009,
2009,Thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural
2009,"conditions, and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing of"
2009,"two species, the reproductive system, independently of the general state"
2009,"of health, is affected in a very similar manner. In the one case, the"
2009,"conditions of life have been disturbed, though often in so slight a"
2009,"degree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case, or that of"
2009,"hybrids, the external conditions have remained the same, but the"
2009,organisation has been disturbed by two distinct structures and
2009,"constitutions, including of course the reproductive systems, having been"
2009,blended into one. For it is scarcely possible that two organisations
2009,"should be compounded into one, without some disturbance occurring in the"
2009,"development, or periodical action, or mutual relations of the different"
2009,parts and organs one to another or to the conditions of life. When
2009,"hybrids are able to breed inter se, they transmit to their offspring"
2009,"from generation to generation the same compounded organisation, and"
2009,"hence we need not be surprised that their sterility, though in some"
2009,"degree variable, does not diminish; it is even apt to increase,"
2009,"this being generally the result, as before explained, of too close"
2009,interbreeding. The above view of the sterility of hybrids being caused
2009,by two constitutions being compounded into one has been strongly
2009,maintained by Max Wichura.
2009,
2009,"It must, however, be owned that we cannot understand, on the above or"
2009,"any other view, several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids;"
2009,"for instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal"
2009,crosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally
2009,and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent. Nor do I pretend
2009,that the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter: no explanation
2009,"is offered why an organism, when placed under unnatural conditions,"
2009,"is rendered sterile. All that I have attempted to show is, that in two"
2009,"cases, in some respects allied, sterility is the common result--in the"
2009,"one case from the conditions of life having been disturbed, in the other"
2009,case from the organisation having been disturbed by two organisations
2009,being compounded into one.
2009,
2009,A similar parallelism holds good with an allied yet very different
2009,"class of facts. It is an old and almost universal belief, founded on a"
2009,"considerable body of evidence, which I have elsewhere given, that slight"
2009,changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all living things.
2009,We see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their frequent
2009,"exchanges of seed, tubers, etc., from one soil or climate to another,"
2009,"and back again. During the convalescence of animals, great benefit is"
2009,"derived from almost any change in their habits of life. Again, both with"
2009,"plants and animals, there is the clearest evidence that a cross between"
2009,"individuals of the same species, which differ to a certain extent, gives"
2009,vigour and fertility to the offspring; and that close interbreeding
2009,"continued during several generations between the nearest relations, if"
2009,"these be kept under the same conditions of life, almost always leads to"
2009,"decreased size, weakness, or sterility."
2009,
2009,"Hence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions"
2009,"of life benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand, that slight"
2009,"crosses, that is, crosses between the males and females of the same"
2009,"species, which have been subjected to slightly different conditions, or"
2009,"which have slightly varied, give vigour and fertility to the offspring."
2009,"But, as we have seen, organic beings long habituated to certain"
2009,"uniform conditions under a state of nature, when subjected, as under"
2009,"confinement, to a considerable change in their conditions, very"
2009,frequently are rendered more or less sterile; and we know that a cross
2009,"between two forms that have become widely or specifically different,"
2009,produce hybrids which are almost always in some degree sterile. I am
2009,fully persuaded that this double parallelism is by no means an accident
2009,"or an illusion. He who is able to explain why the elephant, and a"
2009,"multitude of other animals, are incapable of breeding when kept under"
2009,"only partial confinement in their native country, will be able to"
2009,explain the primary cause of hybrids being so generally sterile. He will
2009,at the same time be able to explain how it is that the races of some of
2009,"our domesticated animals, which have often been subjected to new and"
2009,"not uniform conditions, are quite fertile together, although they are"
2009,"descended from distinct species, which would probably have been sterile"
2009,if aboriginally crossed. The above two parallel series of facts seem
2009,"to be connected together by some common but unknown bond, which is"
2009,"essentially related to the principle of life; this principle, according"
2009,"to Mr. Herbert Spencer, being that life depends on, or consists in, the"
2009,"incessant action and reaction of various forces, which, as throughout"
2009,"nature, are always tending towards an equilibrium; and when this"
2009,"tendency is slightly disturbed by any change, the vital forces gain in"
2009,power.

2009,"This subject may be here briefly discussed, and will be found to throw"
2009,some light on hybridism. Several plants belonging to distinct orders
2009,"present two forms, which exist in about equal numbers and which differ"
2009,in no respect except in their reproductive organs; one form having
2009,"a long pistil with short stamens, the other a short pistil with long"
2009,stamens; the two having differently sized pollen-grains. With trimorphic
2009,plants there are three forms likewise differing in the lengths of their
2009,"pistils and stamens, in the size and colour of the pollen-grains, and"
2009,in some other respects; and as in each of the three forms there are two
2009,"sets of stamens, the three forms possess altogether six sets of stamens"
2009,and three kinds of pistils. These organs are so proportioned in length
2009,to each other that half the stamens in two of the forms stand on a level
2009,"with the stigma of the third form. Now I have shown, and the result"
2009,"has been confirmed by other observers, that in order to obtain full"
2009,"fertility with these plants, it is necessary that the stigma of the"
2009,one form should be fertilised by pollen taken from the stamens of
2009,corresponding height in another form. So that with dimorphic species
2009,"two unions, which may be called legitimate, are fully fertile; and"
2009,"two, which may be called illegitimate, are more or less infertile. With"
2009,"trimorphic species six unions are legitimate, or fully fertile, and"
2009,"twelve are illegitimate, or more or less infertile."
2009,
2009,The infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and
2009,"trimorphic plants, when they are illegitimately fertilised, that is by"
2009,"pollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil,"
2009,"differs much in degree, up to absolute and utter sterility; just in the"
2009,same manner as occurs in crossing distinct species. As the degree
2009,of sterility in the latter case depends in an eminent degree on the
2009,"conditions of life being more or less favourable, so I have found it"
2009,with illegitimate unions. It is well known that if pollen of a distinct
2009,"species be placed on the stigma of a flower, and its own pollen be"
2009,"afterwards, even after a considerable interval of time, placed on the"
2009,"same stigma, its action is so strongly prepotent that it generally"
2009,annihilates the effect of the foreign pollen; so it is with the pollen
2009,"of the several forms of the same species, for legitimate pollen is"
2009,"strongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen, when both are placed on the"
2009,"same stigma. I ascertained this by fertilising several flowers, first"
2009,"illegitimately, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately, with"
2009,"pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety, and all the seedlings"
2009,"were similarly coloured; this shows that the legitimate pollen,"
2009,"though applied twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly destroyed"
2009,or prevented the action of the previously applied illegitimate pollen.
2009,"Again, as in making reciprocal crosses between the same two species,"
2009,"there is occasionally a great difference in the result, so the same"
2009,"thing occurs with trimorphic plants; for instance, the mid-styled form"
2009,of Lythrum salicaria was illegitimately fertilised with the greatest
2009,"ease by pollen from the longer stamens of the short-styled form, and"
2009,yielded many seeds; but the latter form did not yield a single seed when
2009,fertilised by the longer stamens of the mid-styled form.
2009,
2009,"In all these respects, and in others which might be added, the forms"
2009,"of the same undoubted species, when illegitimately united, behave in"
2009,exactly the same manner as do two distinct species when crossed. This
2009,"led me carefully to observe during four years many seedlings, raised"
2009,from several illegitimate unions. The chief result is that these
2009,"illegitimate plants, as they may be called, are not fully fertile. It"
2009,"is possible to raise from dimorphic species, both long-styled and"
2009,"short-styled illegitimate plants, and from trimorphic plants all three"
2009,illegitimate forms. These can then be properly united in a legitimate
2009,"manner. When this is done, there is no apparent reason why they"
2009,should not yield as many seeds as did their parents when legitimately
2009,"fertilised. But such is not the case. They are all infertile, in various"
2009,degrees; some being so utterly and incurably sterile that they did
2009,not yield during four seasons a single seed or even seed-capsule. The
2009,"sterility of these illegitimate plants, when united with each other in"
2009,"a legitimate manner, may be strictly compared with that of hybrids when"
2009,"crossed inter se. If, on the other hand, a hybrid is crossed with either"
2009,"pure parent-species, the sterility is usually much lessened: and so it"
2009,is when an illegitimate plant is fertilised by a legitimate plant. In
2009,the same manner as the sterility of hybrids does not always run
2009,parallel with the difficulty of making the first cross between the two
2009,"parent-species, so that sterility of certain illegitimate plants was"
2009,"unusually great, while the sterility of the union from which they"
2009,were derived was by no means great. With hybrids raised from the same
2009,"seed-capsule the degree of sterility is innately variable, so it is in a"
2009,"marked manner with illegitimate plants. Lastly, many hybrids are profuse"
2009,"and persistent flowerers, while other and more sterile hybrids produce"
2009,"few flowers, and are weak, miserable dwarfs; exactly similar cases occur"
2009,with the illegitimate offspring of various dimorphic and trimorphic
2009,plants.
2009,
2009,Altogether there is the closest identity in character and behaviour
2009,between illegitimate plants and hybrids. It is hardly an exaggeration
2009,"to maintain that illegitimate plants are hybrids, produced within the"
2009,"limits of the same species by the improper union of certain forms, while"
2009,ordinary hybrids are produced from an improper union between so-called
2009,distinct species. We have also already seen that there is the closest
2009,similarity in all respects between first illegitimate unions and first
2009,crosses between distinct species. This will perhaps be made more fully
2009,apparent by an illustration; we may suppose that a botanist found two
2009,well-marked varieties (and such occur) of the long-styled form of the
2009,"trimorphic Lythrum salicaria, and that he determined to try by crossing"
2009,whether they were specifically distinct. He would find that they yielded
2009,"only about one-fifth of the proper number of seed, and that they behaved"
2009,in all the other above specified respects as if they had been two
2009,"distinct species. But to make the case sure, he would raise plants from"
2009,"his supposed hybridised seed, and he would find that the seedlings were"
2009,"miserably dwarfed and utterly sterile, and that they behaved in all"
2009,other respects like ordinary hybrids. He might then maintain that he
2009,"had actually proved, in accordance with the common view, that his two"
2009,varieties were as good and as distinct species as any in the world; but
2009,he would be completely mistaken.
2009,
2009,"The facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are important,"
2009,"because they show us, first, that the physiological test of lessened"
2009,"fertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no safe criterion"
2009,"of specific distinction; secondly, because we may conclude that there is"
2009,some unknown bond which connects the infertility of illegitimate unions
2009,"with that of their illegitimate offspring, and we are led to extend the"
2009,"same view to first crosses and hybrids; thirdly, because we find, and"
2009,"this seems to me of especial importance, that two or three forms of the"
2009,"same species may exist and may differ in no respect whatever, either in"
2009,"structure or in constitution, relatively to external conditions, and yet"
2009,be sterile when united in certain ways. For we must remember that it is
2009,"the union of the sexual elements of individuals of the same form, for"
2009,"instance, of two long-styled forms, which results in sterility; while it"
2009,is the union of the sexual elements proper to two distinct forms which
2009,is fertile. Hence the case appears at first sight exactly the reverse
2009,"of what occurs, in the ordinary unions of the individuals of the same"
2009,"species and with crosses between distinct species. It is, however,"
2009,doubtful whether this is really so; but I will not enlarge on this
2009,obscure subject.
2009,
2009,"We may, however, infer as probable from the consideration of dimorphic"
2009,"and trimorphic plants, that the sterility of distinct species when"
2009,"crossed and of their hybrid progeny, depends exclusively on the nature"
2009,"of their sexual elements, and not on any difference in their structure"
2009,or general constitution. We are also led to this same conclusion by
2009,"considering reciprocal crosses, in which the male of one species cannot"
2009,"be united, or can be united with great difficulty, with the female of"
2009,"a second species, while the converse cross can be effected with perfect"
2009,"facility. That excellent observer, Gartner, likewise concluded that"
2009,species when crossed are sterile owing to differences confined to their
2009,reproductive systems.
2009,
2009,"FERTILITY OF VARIETIES WHEN CROSSED, AND OF THEIR MONGREL OFFSPRING, NOT"
2009,UNIVERSAL.
2009,
2009,It may be urged as an overwhelming argument that there must be some
2009,essential distinction between species and varieties inasmuch as the
2009,"latter, however much they may differ from each other in external"
2009,"appearance, cross with perfect facility, and yield perfectly fertile"
2009,"offspring. With some exceptions, presently to be given, I fully admit"
2009,"that this is the rule. But the subject is surrounded by difficulties,"
2009,"for, looking to varieties produced under nature, if two forms hitherto"
2009,"reputed to be varieties be found in any degree sterile together, they"
2009,"are at once ranked by most naturalists as species. For instance, the"
2009,"blue and red pimpernel, which are considered by most botanists as"
2009,"varieties, are said by Gartner to be quite sterile when crossed, and"
2009,he consequently ranks them as undoubted species. If we thus argue in
2009,"a circle, the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will"
2009,assuredly have to be granted.
2009,
2009,"If we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been produced,"
2009,"under domestication, we are still involved in some doubt. For when it"
2009,"is stated, for instance, that certain South American indigenous domestic"
2009,"dogs do not readily unite with European dogs, the explanation which will"
2009,"occur to everyone, and probably the true one, is that they are descended"
2009,from aboriginally distinct species. Nevertheless the perfect fertility
2009,"of so many domestic races, differing widely from each other in"
2009,"appearance, for instance, those of the pigeon, or of the cabbage, is a"
2009,remarkable fact; more especially when we reflect how many species there
2009,"are, which, though resembling each other most closely, are utterly"
2009,"sterile when intercrossed. Several considerations, however, render the"
2009,"fertility of domestic varieties less remarkable. In the first place,"
2009,it may be observed that the amount of external difference between two
2009,"species is no sure guide to their degree of mutual sterility, so that"
2009,similar differences in the case of varieties would be no sure guide. It
2009,is certain that with species the cause lies exclusively in differences
2009,in their sexual constitution. Now the varying conditions to which
2009,"domesticated animals and cultivated plants have been subjected, have had"
2009,so little tendency towards modifying the reproductive system in a manner
2009,"leading to mutual sterility, that we have good grounds for admitting"
2009,"the directly opposite doctrine of Pallas, namely, that such conditions"
2009,generally eliminate this tendency; so that the domesticated descendants
2009,"of species, which in their natural state probably would have been in"
2009,"some degree sterile when crossed, become perfectly fertile together."
2009,"With plants, so far is cultivation from giving a tendency towards"
2009,"sterility between distinct species, that in several well-authenticated"
2009,"cases already alluded to, certain plants have been affected in an"
2009,"opposite manner, for they have become self-impotent, while still"
2009,"retaining the capacity of fertilising, and being fertilised by, other"
2009,species. If the Pallasian doctrine of the elimination of sterility
2009,"through long-continued domestication be admitted, and it can hardly"
2009,"be rejected, it becomes in the highest degree improbable that similar"
2009,conditions long-continued should likewise induce this tendency; though
2009,"in certain cases, with species having a peculiar constitution, sterility"
2009,"might occasionally be thus caused. Thus, as I believe, we can understand"
2009,"why, with domesticated animals, varieties have not been produced"
2009,"which are mutually sterile; and why with plants only a few such cases,"
2009,"immediately to be given, have been observed."
2009,
2009,"The real difficulty in our present subject is not, as it appears to me,"
2009,"why domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile when crossed,"
2009,"but why this has so generally occurred with natural varieties, as soon"
2009,as they have been permanently modified in a sufficient degree to take
2009,rank as species. We are far from precisely knowing the cause; nor is
2009,"this surprising, seeing how profoundly ignorant we are in regard to the"
2009,normal and abnormal action of the reproductive system. But we can
2009,"see that species, owing to their struggle for existence with numerous"
2009,"competitors, will have been exposed during long periods of time to more"
2009,"uniform conditions, than have domestic varieties; and this may well make"
2009,a wide difference in the result. For we know how commonly wild animals
2009,"and plants, when taken from their natural conditions and subjected"
2009,"to captivity, are rendered sterile; and the reproductive functions of"
2009,organic beings which have always lived under natural conditions would
2009,probably in like manner be eminently sensitive to the influence of an
2009,"unnatural cross. Domesticated productions, on the other hand, which,"
2009,"as shown by the mere fact of their domestication, were not originally"
2009,"highly sensitive to changes in their conditions of life, and which can"
2009,now generally resist with undiminished fertility repeated changes of
2009,"conditions, might be expected to produce varieties, which would be"
2009,little liable to have their reproductive powers injuriously affected by
2009,the act of crossing with other varieties which had originated in a like
2009,manner.
2009,
2009,I have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were
2009,invariably fertile when intercrossed. But it is impossible to resist the
2009,evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the few
2009,"following cases, which I will briefly abstract. The evidence is at least"
2009,as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude of
2009,"species. The evidence is also derived from hostile witnesses, who in"
2009,all other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of
2009,"specific distinction. Gartner kept, during several years, a dwarf kind"
2009,"of maize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with red seeds growing"
2009,near each other in his garden; and although these plants have separated
2009,"sexes, they never naturally crossed. He then fertilised thirteen"
2009,flowers of the one kind with pollen of the other; but only a single
2009,"head produced any seed, and this one head produced only five grains."
2009,"Manipulation in this case could not have been injurious, as the plants"
2009,"have separated sexes. No one, I believe, has suspected that these"
2009,varieties of maize are distinct species; and it is important to notice
2009,that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves PERFECTLY fertile;
2009,so that even Gartner did not venture to consider the two varieties as
2009,specifically distinct.
2009,
2009,"Girou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like"
2009,"the maize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual"
2009,fertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences are
2009,"greater. How far these experiments may be trusted, I know not; but"
2009,"the forms experimented on are ranked by Sagaret, who mainly founds his"
2009,"classification by the test of infertility, as varieties, and Naudin has"
2009,come to the same conclusion.
2009,
2009,"The following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first"
2009,incredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments
2009,"made during many years on nine species of Verbascum, by so good an"
2009,"observer and so hostile a witness as Gartner: namely, that the yellow"
2009,and white varieties when crossed produce less seed than the similarly
2009,"coloured varieties of the same species. Moreover, he asserts that, when"
2009,yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow and
2009,"white varieties of a DISTINCT species, more seed is produced by the"
2009,"crosses between the similarly coloured flowers, than between those which"
2009,are differently coloured. Mr. Scott also has experimented on the species
2009,and varieties of Verbascum; and although unable to confirm Gartner's
2009,"results on the crossing of the distinct species, he finds that the"
2009,"dissimilarly coloured varieties of the same species yield fewer seeds,"
2009,"in the proportion of eighty-six to , than the similarly coloured"
2009,"varieties. Yet these varieties differ in no respect, except in the"
2009,colour of their flowers; and one variety can sometimes be raised from
2009,the seed of another.
2009,
2009,"Kolreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent"
2009,"observer, has proved the remarkable fact that one particular variety"
2009,"of the common tobacco was more fertile than the other varieties, when"
2009,crossed with a widely distinct species. He experimented on five forms
2009,"which are commonly reputed to be varieties, and which he tested by"
2009,"the severest trial, namely, by reciprocal crosses, and he found their"
2009,"mongrel offspring perfectly fertile. But one of these five varieties,"
2009,"when used either as the father or mother, and crossed with the Nicotiana"
2009,"glutinosa, always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were"
2009,produced from the four other varieties when crossed with N. glutinosa.
2009,Hence the reproductive system of this one variety must have been in some
2009,manner and in some degree modified.
2009,
2009,From these facts it can no longer be maintained that varieties when
2009,crossed are invariably quite fertile. From the great difficulty of
2009,"ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a"
2009,"supposed variety, if proved to be infertile in any degree, would almost"
2009,universally be ranked as a species; from man attending only to external
2009,"characters in his domestic varieties, and from such varieties not having"
2009,been exposed for very long periods to uniform conditions of life; from
2009,these several considerations we may conclude that fertility does not
2009,constitute a fundamental distinction between varieties and species when
2009,crossed. The general sterility of crossed species may safely be looked
2009,"at, not as a special acquirement or endowment, but as incidental on"
2009,changes of an unknown nature in their sexual elements.
2009,
2009,"HYBRIDS AND MONGRELS COMPARED, INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR FERTILITY."
2009,
2009,"Independently of the question of fertility, the offspring of species"
2009,and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several other respects.
2009,"Gartner, whose strong wish it was to draw a distinct line between"
2009,"species and varieties, could find very few, and, as it seems to me,"
2009,quite unimportant differences between the so-called hybrid offspring of
2009,"species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of varieties. And, on the"
2009,"other hand, they agree most closely in many important respects."
2009,
2009,I shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. The most
2009,"important distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are"
2009,more variable than hybrids; but Gartner admits that hybrids from
2009,species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first
2009,generation; and I have myself seen striking instances of this fact.
2009,Gartner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species
2009,are more variable than those from very distinct species; and this shows
2009,that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away.
2009,When mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several
2009,"generations, an extreme amount of variability in the offspring in both"
2009,cases is notorious; but some few instances of both hybrids and mongrels
2009,"long retaining a uniform character could be given. The variability,"
2009,"however, in the successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater"
2009,than in hybrids.
2009,
2009,This greater variability in mongrels than in hybrids does not seem at
2009,"all surprising. For the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly"
2009,domestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on natural
2009,"varieties), and this implies that there has been recent variability;"
2009,which would often continue and would augment that arising from the act
2009,"of crossing. The slight variability of hybrids in the first generation,"
2009,"in contrast with that in the succeeding generations, is a curious fact"
2009,and deserves attention. For it bears on the view which I have taken of
2009,"one of the causes of ordinary variability; namely, that the reproductive"
2009,"system, from being eminently sensitive to changed conditions of life,"
2009,fails under these circumstances to perform its proper function of
2009,producing offspring closely similar in all respects to the parent-form.
2009,"Now, hybrids in the first generation are descended from species"
2009,(excluding those long cultivated) which have not had their reproductive
2009,"systems in any way affected, and they are not variable; but hybrids"
2009,"themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected, and their"
2009,descendants are highly variable.
2009,
2009,But to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids: Gartner states
2009,that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either parent
2009,"form; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in degree."
2009,"Moreover, Gartner expressly states that the hybrids from long cultivated"
2009,plants are more subject to reversion than hybrids from species in their
2009,natural state; and this probably explains the singular difference in
2009,the results arrived at by different observers. Thus Max Wichura doubts
2009,"whether hybrids ever revert to their parent forms, and he experimented"
2009,"on uncultivated species of willows, while Naudin, on the other hand,"
2009,insists in the strongest terms on the almost universal tendency to
2009,"reversion in hybrids, and he experimented chiefly on cultivated plants."
2009,"Gartner further states that when any two species, although most closely"
2009,"allied to each other, are crossed with a third species, the hybrids are"
2009,widely different from each other; whereas if two very distinct varieties
2009,"of one species are crossed with another species, the hybrids do not"
2009,"differ much. But this conclusion, as far as I can make out, is founded"
2009,on a single experiment; and seems directly opposed to the results of
2009,several experiments made by Kolreuter.
2009,
2009,Such alone are the unimportant differences which Gartner is able to
2009,"point out between hybrid and mongrel plants. On the other hand, the"
2009,degrees and kinds of resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their
2009,"respective parents, more especially in hybrids produced from nearly"
2009,"related species, follow, according to Gartner the same laws. When two"
2009,"species are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing"
2009,its likeness on the hybrid. So I believe it to be with varieties of
2009,"plants; and with animals, one variety certainly often has this prepotent"
2009,power over another variety. Hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal
2009,"cross generally resemble each other closely, and so it is with mongrel"
2009,plants from a reciprocal cross. Both hybrids and mongrels can be
2009,"reduced to either pure parent form, by repeated crosses in successive"
2009,generations with either parent.
2009,
2009,These several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the
2009,"subject is here much complicated, partly owing to the existence of"
2009,secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency
2009,in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in
2009,"the other, both when one species is crossed with another and when one"
2009,"variety is crossed with another variety. For instance, I think those"
2009,authors are right who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over
2009,"the horse, so that both the mule and the hinny resemble more closely the"
2009,ass than the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the
2009,"male than in the female ass, so that the mule, which is an offspring of"
2009,"the male ass and mare, is more like an ass than is the hinny, which is"
2009,the offspring of the female-ass and stallion.
2009,
2009,"Much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that"
2009,it is only with mongrels that the offspring are not intermediate in
2009,"character, but closely resemble one of their parents; but this does"
2009,"sometimes occur with hybrids, yet I grant much less frequently than"
2009,with mongrels. Looking to the cases which I have collected of cross-bred
2009,"animals closely resembling one parent, the resemblances seem chiefly"
2009,"confined to characters almost monstrous in their nature, and which have"
2009,"suddenly appeared--such as albinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or"
2009,"horns, or additional fingers and toes; and do not relate to characters"
2009,which have been slowly acquired through selection. A tendency to sudden
2009,"reversions to the perfect character of either parent would, also,"
2009,"be much more likely to occur with mongrels, which are descended from"
2009,"varieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in character, than"
2009,"with hybrids, which are descended from species slowly and naturally"
2009,"produced. On the whole, I entirely agree with Dr. Prosper Lucas, who,"
2009,"after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals,"
2009,comes to the conclusion that the laws of resemblance of the child to its
2009,"parents are the same, whether the two parents differ little or much from"
2009,"each other, namely, in the union of individuals of the same variety, or"
2009,"of different varieties, or of distinct species."
2009,
2009,"Independently of the question of fertility and sterility, in all"
2009,other respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the
2009,"offspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties. If we look at"
2009,"species as having been specially created, and at varieties as having"
2009,"been produced by secondary laws, this similarity would be an astonishing"
2009,fact. But it harmonises perfectly with the view that there is no
2009,essential distinction between species and varieties.
2009,
2009,SUMMARY OF CHAPTER.
2009,
2009,"First crosses between forms, sufficiently distinct to be ranked as"
2009,"species, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not universally,"
2009,"sterile. The sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight that"
2009,the most careful experimentalists have arrived at diametrically opposite
2009,conclusions in ranking forms by this test. The sterility is innately
2009,"variable in individuals of the same species, and is eminently"
2009,susceptible to action of favourable and unfavourable conditions. The
2009,"degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but is"
2009,"governed by several curious and complex laws. It is generally different,"
2009,and sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the same
2009,two species. It is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in
2009,the hybrids produced from this cross.
2009,
2009,"In the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity in one species or"
2009,"variety to take on another, is incidental on differences, generally"
2009,"of an unknown nature, in their vegetative systems, so in crossing,"
2009,the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another is
2009,incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. There
2009,is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with
2009,various degrees of sterility to prevent their crossing and blending
2009,"in nature, than to think that trees have been specially endowed with"
2009,various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted
2009,together in order to prevent their inarching in our forests.
2009,
2009,The sterility of first crosses and of their hybrid progeny has not been
2009,acquired through natural selection. In the case of first crosses it
2009,seems to depend on several circumstances; in some instances in chief
2009,"part on the early death of the embryo. In the case of hybrids, it"
2009,apparently depends on their whole organisation having been disturbed by
2009,being compounded from two distinct forms; the sterility being closely
2009,"allied to that which so frequently affects pure species, when exposed to"
2009,new and unnatural conditions of life. He who will explain these latter
2009,cases will be able to explain the sterility of hybrids. This view is
2009,"strongly supported by a parallelism of another kind: namely, that,"
2009,"firstly, slight changes in the conditions of life add to the vigour"
2009,"and fertility of all organic beings; and secondly, that the crossing of"
2009,"forms, which have been exposed to slightly different conditions of life,"
2009,"or which have varied, favours the size, vigour and fertility of their"
2009,offspring. The facts given on the sterility of the illegitimate unions
2009,"of dimorphic and trimorphic plants and of their illegitimate progeny,"
2009,perhaps render it probable that some unknown bond in all cases connects
2009,the degree of fertility of first unions with that of their offspring.
2009,"The consideration of these facts on dimorphism, as well as of the"
2009,"results of reciprocal crosses, clearly leads to the conclusion that"
2009,the primary cause of the sterility of crossed species is confined to
2009,"differences in their sexual elements. But why, in the case of distinct"
2009,"species, the sexual elements should so generally have become more or"
2009,"less modified, leading to their mutual infertility, we do not know; but"
2009,it seems to stand in some close relation to species having been exposed
2009,for long periods of time to nearly uniform conditions of life.
2009,
2009,"It is not surprising that the difficulty in crossing any two species,"
2009,"and the sterility of their hybrid offspring, should in most cases"
2009,"correspond, even if due to distinct causes: for both depend on the"
2009,amount of difference between the species which are crossed. Nor is
2009,"it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross, and the"
2009,"fertility of the hybrids thus produced, and the capacity of being"
2009,grafted together--though this latter capacity evidently depends on
2009,"widely different circumstances--should all run, to a certain extent,"
2009,parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms subjected to
2009,experiment; for systematic affinity includes resemblances of all kinds.
2009,
2009,"First crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently alike"
2009,"to be considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are very"
2009,"generally, but not, as is so often stated, invariably fertile. Nor"
2009,"is this almost universal and perfect fertility surprising, when it"
2009,is remembered how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to
2009,varieties in a state of nature; and when we remember that the greater
2009,number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the
2009,"selection of mere external differences, and that they have not been long"
2009,exposed to uniform conditions of life. It should also be especially kept
2009,"in mind, that long-continued domestication tends to eliminate"
2009,"sterility, and is therefore little likely to induce this same quality."
2009,"Independently of the question of fertility, in all other respects there"
2009,"is the closest general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels, in"
2009,"their variability, in their power of absorbing each other by repeated"
2009,"crosses, and in their inheritance of characters from both parent-forms."
2009,"Finally, then, although we are as ignorant of the precise cause of the"
2009,sterility of first crosses and of hybrids as we are why animals and
2009,"plants removed from their natural conditions become sterile, yet the"
2009,facts given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to the belief that
2009,species aboriginally existed as varieties.

2009,CHAPTER X. ON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD.
2009,
2009, On the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day--On the
2009, nature of extinct intermediate varieties; on their number--On the lapse
2009," of time, as inferred from the rate of denudation and of deposition"
2009, number--On the lapse of time as estimated by years--On the poorness of
2009, our palaeontological collections--On the intermittence of geological
2009, formations--On the denudation of granitic areas--On the absence of
2009, intermediate varieties in any one formation--On the sudden appearance
2009, of groups of species--On their sudden appearance in the lowest known
2009, fossiliferous strata--Antiquity of the habitable earth.
2009,
2009,
2009,In the sixth chapter I enumerated the chief objections which might be
2009,justly urged against the views maintained in this volume. Most of them
2009,"have now been discussed. One, namely, the distinctness of specific forms"
2009,"and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links,"
2009,is a very obvious difficulty. I assigned reasons why such links do not
2009,commonly occur at the present day under the circumstances apparently
2009,"most favourable for their presence, namely, on an extensive and"
2009,continuous area with graduated physical conditions. I endeavoured to
2009,"show, that the life of each species depends in a more important manner"
2009,"on the presence of other already defined organic forms, than on climate,"
2009,"and, therefore, that the really governing conditions of life do not"
2009,"graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture. I endeavoured,"
2009,"also, to show that intermediate varieties, from existing in lesser"
2009,"numbers than the forms which they connect, will generally be beaten"
2009,out and exterminated during the course of further modification and
2009,"improvement. The main cause, however, of innumerable intermediate links"
2009,"not now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends, on the very"
2009,"process of natural selection, through which new varieties continually"
2009,take the places of and supplant their parent-forms. But just in
2009,proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous
2009,"scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly"
2009,"existed, be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation"
2009,and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly
2009,"does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this,"
2009,"perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged"
2009,"against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme"
2009,imperfection of the geological record.
2009,
2009,"In the first place, it should always be borne in mind what sort of"
2009,"intermediate forms must, on the theory, have formerly existed. I have"
2009,"found it difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing"
2009,to myself forms DIRECTLY intermediate between them. But this is a wholly
2009,false view; we should always look for forms intermediate between each
2009,species and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor
2009,will generally have differed in some respects from all its modified
2009,descendants. To give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter
2009,pigeons are both descended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all
2009,"the intermediate varieties which have ever existed, we should have an"
2009,extremely close series between both and the rock-pigeon; but we should
2009,have no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter;
2009,"none, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop"
2009,"somewhat enlarged, the characteristic features of these two breeds."
2009,"These two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that, if we"
2009,"had no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin, it would"
2009,not have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of
2009,"their structure with that of the rock-pigeon, C. livia, whether they had"
2009,"descended from this species or from some other allied species, such as"
2009,C. oenas.
2009,
2009,"So with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance"
2009,"to the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links directly"
2009,"intermediate between them ever existed, but between each and an unknown"
2009,common parent. The common parent will have had in its whole organisation
2009,much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse; but in some
2009,"points of structure may have differed considerably from both, even"
2009,"perhaps more than they differ from each other. Hence, in all such cases,"
2009,we should be unable to recognise the parent-form of any two or more
2009,"species, even if we closely compared the structure of the parent with"
2009,"that of its modified descendants, unless at the same time we had a"
2009,nearly perfect chain of the intermediate links.
2009,
2009,"It is just possible, by the theory, that one of two living forms might"
2009,"have descended from the other; for instance, a horse from a tapir; and"
2009,in this case DIRECT intermediate links will have existed between them.
2009,But such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long
2009,"period unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of"
2009,"change; and the principle of competition between organism and organism,"
2009,"between child and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all"
2009,cases the new and improved forms of life tend to supplant the old and
2009,unimproved forms.
2009,
2009,By the theory of natural selection all living species have been
2009,"connected with the parent-species of each genus, by differences not"
2009,greater than we see between the natural and domestic varieties of the
2009,"same species at the present day; and these parent-species, now generally"
2009,"extinct, have in their turn been similarly connected with more ancient"
2009,"forms; and so on backwards, always converging to the common ancestor of"
2009,each great class. So that the number of intermediate and transitional
2009,"links, between all living and extinct species, must have been"
2009,"inconceivably great. But assuredly, if this theory be true, such have"
2009,lived upon the earth.
2009,
2009,"ON THE LAPSE OF TIME, AS INFERRED FROM THE RATE OF DEPOSITION AND EXTENT"
2009,OF DENUDATION.
2009,
2009,Independently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitely
2009,"numerous connecting links, it may be objected that time cannot have"
2009,"sufficed for so great an amount of organic change, all changes having"
2009,been effected slowly. It is hardly possible for me to recall to the
2009,"reader who is not a practical geologist, the facts leading the mind"
2009,feebly to comprehend the lapse of time. He who can read Sir Charles
2009,"Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future"
2009,historian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural
2009,"science, and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of"
2009,"time, may at once close this volume. Not that it suffices to study"
2009,"the Principles of Geology, or to read special treatises by different"
2009,"observers on separate formations, and to mark how each author attempts"
2009,"to give an inadequate idea of the duration of each formation, or even"
2009,of each stratum. We can best gain some idea of past time by knowing the
2009,agencies at work; and learning how deeply the surface of the land has
2009,"been denuded, and how much sediment has been deposited. As Lyell has"
2009,"well remarked, the extent and thickness of our sedimentary formations"
2009,are the result and the measure of the denudation which the earth's crust
2009,has elsewhere undergone. Therefore a man should examine for himself the
2009,"great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the rivulets bringing down"
2009,"mud, and the waves wearing away the sea-cliffs, in order to comprehend"
2009,"something about the duration of past time, the monuments of which we see"
2009,all around us.
2009,
2009,"It is good to wander along the coast, when formed of moderately hard"
2009,"rocks, and mark the process of degradation. The tides in most cases"
2009,"reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the waves eat"
2009,into them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles; for there is
2009,good evidence that pure water effects nothing in wearing away rock. At
2009,"last the base of the cliff is undermined, huge fragments fall down, and"
2009,"these remaining fixed, have to be worn away atom by atom, until after"
2009,"being reduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves, and then"
2009,"they are more quickly ground into pebbles, sand, or mud. But how often"
2009,"do we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all"
2009,"thickly clothed by marine productions, showing how little they are"
2009,"abraded and how seldom they are rolled about! Moreover, if we follow for"
2009,"a few miles any line of rocky cliff, which is undergoing degradation,"
2009,"we find that it is only here and there, along a short length or round"
2009,"a promontory, that the cliffs are at the present time suffering. The"
2009,appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that elsewhere years
2009,have elapsed since the waters washed their base.
2009,
2009,"We have, however, recently learned from the observations of Ramsay, in"
2009,"the van of many excellent observers--of Jukes, Geikie, Croll and"
2009,"others, that subaerial degradation is a much more important agency than"
2009,"coast-action, or the power of the waves. The whole surface of the land"
2009,"is exposed to the chemical action of the air and of the rainwater,"
2009,"with its dissolved carbonic acid, and in colder countries to frost; the"
2009,disintegrated matter is carried down even gentle slopes during heavy
2009,"rain, and to a greater extent than might be supposed, especially in"
2009,"arid districts, by the wind; it is then transported by the streams"
2009,"and rivers, which, when rapid deepen their channels, and triturate the"
2009,"fragments. On a rainy day, even in a gently undulating country, we see"
2009,the effects of subaerial degradation in the muddy rills which flow down
2009,"every slope. Messrs. Ramsay and Whitaker have shown, and the observation"
2009,"is a most striking one, that the great lines of escarpment in the"
2009,"Wealden district and those ranging across England, which formerly were"
2009,"looked at as ancient sea-coasts, cannot have been thus formed, for each"
2009,"line is composed of one and the same formation, while our sea-cliffs are"
2009,everywhere formed by the intersection of various formations. This being
2009,"the case, we are compelled to admit that the escarpments owe their"
2009,"origin in chief part to the rocks of which they are composed, having"
2009,resisted subaerial denudation better than the surrounding surface;
2009,"this surface consequently has been gradually lowered, with the lines of"
2009,harder rock left projecting. Nothing impresses the mind with the vast
2009,"duration of time, according to our ideas of time, more forcibly than the"
2009,"conviction thus gained that subaerial agencies, which apparently have"
2009,"so little power, and which seem to work so slowly, have produced great"
2009,results.
2009,
2009,When thus impressed with the slow rate at which the land is worn
2009,"away through subaerial and littoral action, it is good, in order to"
2009,"appreciate the past duration of time, to consider, on the one hand, the"
2009,"masses of rock which have been removed over many extensive areas, and on"
2009,the other hand the thickness of our sedimentary formations. I remember
2009,"having been much struck when viewing volcanic islands, which have been"
2009,worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of
2009,one or two thousand feet in height; for the gentle slope of the
2009,"lava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how"
2009,"far the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. The same"
2009,story is told still more plainly by faults--those great cracks along
2009,"which the strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the"
2009,"other, to the height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust"
2009,"cracked, and it makes no great difference whether the upheaval was"
2009,"sudden, or, as most geologists now believe, was slow and effected by"
2009,"many starts, the surface of the land has been so completely planed down"
2009,that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible. The
2009,"Craven fault, for instance, extends for upward of thirty miles, and"
2009,along this line the vertical displacement of the strata varies from 
2009,"to , feet. Professor Ramsay has published an account of a downthrow"
2009,"in Anglesea of , feet; and he informs me that he fully believes that"
2009,"there is one in Merionethshire of , feet; yet in these cases there"
2009,is nothing on the surface of the land to show such prodigious movements;
2009,the pile of rocks on either side of the crack having been smoothly swept
2009,away.
2009,
2009,"On the other hand, in all parts of the world the piles of sedimentary"
2009,"strata are of wonderful thickness. In the Cordillera, I estimated one"
2009,mass of conglomerate at ten thousand feet; and although conglomerates
2009,"have probably been accumulated at a quicker rate than finer sediments,"
2009,"yet from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles, each of which bears"
2009,"the stamp of time, they are good to show how slowly the mass must"
2009,have been heaped together. Professor Ramsay has given me the maximum
2009,"thickness, from actual measurement in most cases, of the successive"
2009,formations in DIFFERENT parts of Great Britain; and this is the
2009,result:--
2009,
2009,                                                  Feet
2009,
2009," Palaeozoic strata (not including igneous beds)..,"
2009," Secondary strata................................,"
2009," Tertiary strata..................................,"
2009,
2009," --making altogether , feet;"
2009,
2009,
2009,"that is, very nearly thirteen and three-quarters British miles."
2009,"Some of these formations, which are represented in England by thin beds,"
2009,"are thousands of feet in thickness on the Continent. Moreover, between"
2009,"each successive formation we have, in the opinion of most geologists,"
2009,blank periods of enormous length. So that the lofty pile of sedimentary
2009,rocks in Britain gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has
2009,elapsed during their accumulation. The consideration of these various
2009,facts impresses the mind almost in the same manner as does the vain
2009,endeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity.
2009,
2009,"Nevertheless this impression is partly false. Mr. Croll, in an"
2009,"interesting paper, remarks that we do not err ""in forming too great a"
2009,"conception of the length of geological periods,"" but in estimating them"
2009,"by years. When geologists look at large and complicated phenomena, and"
2009,"then at the figures representing several million years, the two produce"
2009,"a totally different effect on the mind, and the figures are at once"
2009,"pronounced too small. In regard to subaerial denudation, Mr. Croll"
2009,"shows, by calculating the known amount of sediment annually brought down"
2009,"by certain rivers, relatively to their areas of drainage, that ,"
2009,"feet of solid rock, as it became gradually disintegrated, would thus"
2009,be removed from the mean level of the whole area in the course of six
2009,"million years. This seems an astonishing result, and some considerations"
2009,"lead to the suspicion that it may be too large, but if halved or"
2009,"quartered it is still very surprising. Few of us, however, know what a"
2009,million really means: Mr. Croll gives the following illustration: Take
2009,"a narrow strip of paper, eighty-three feet four inches in length, and"
2009,stretch it along the wall of a large hall; then mark off at one end
2009,the tenth of an inch. This tenth of an inch will represent one hundred
2009,"years, and the entire strip a million years. But let it be borne in"
2009,"mind, in relation to the subject of this work, what a hundred years"
2009,"implies, represented as it is by a measure utterly insignificant in a"
2009,"hall of the above dimensions. Several eminent breeders, during a single"
2009,"lifetime, have so largely modified some of the higher animals, which"
2009,"propagate their kind much more slowly than most of the lower animals,"
2009,that they have formed what well deserves to be called a new sub-breed.
2009,Few men have attended with due care to any one strain for more than half
2009,"a century, so that a hundred years represents the work of two breeders"
2009,in succession. It is not to be supposed that species in a state of
2009,nature ever change so quickly as domestic animals under the guidance of
2009,methodical selection. The comparison would be in every way fairer
2009,"with the effects which follow from unconscious selection, that is, the"
2009,"preservation of the most useful or beautiful animals, with no intention"
2009,"of modifying the breed; but by this process of unconscious selection,"
2009,various breeds have been sensibly changed in the course of two or three
2009,centuries.
2009,
2009,"Species, however, probably change much more slowly, and within the same"
2009,country only a few change at the same time. This slowness follows from
2009,all the inhabitants of the same country being already so well adapted to
2009,"each other, that new places in the polity of nature do not occur until"
2009,"after long intervals, due to the occurrence of physical changes of some"
2009,"kind, or through the immigration of new forms. Moreover, variations"
2009,"or individual differences of the right nature, by which some of the"
2009,inhabitants might be better fitted to their new places under the altered
2009,"circumstance, would not always occur at once. Unfortunately we have no"
2009,"means of determining, according to the standard of years, how long a"
2009,period it takes to modify a species; but to the subject of time we must
2009,return.
2009,
2009,ON THE POORNESS OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS.
2009,
2009,"Now let us turn to our richest museums, and what a paltry display we"
2009,behold! That our collections are imperfect is admitted by every one. The
2009,"remark of that admirable palaeontologist, Edward Forbes, should never"
2009,"be forgotten, namely, that very many fossil species are known and"
2009,"named from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens"
2009,collected on some one spot. Only a small portion of the surface of the
2009,"earth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient"
2009,"care, as the important discoveries made every year in Europe prove."
2009,No organism wholly soft can be preserved. Shells and bones decay and
2009,"disappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not"
2009,"accumulating. We probably take a quite erroneous view, when we assume"
2009,"that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea,"
2009,at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains.
2009,"Throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue"
2009,tint of the water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on record of a
2009,"formation conformably covered, after an immense interval of time, by"
2009,"another and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered"
2009,"in the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view"
2009,of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered
2009,"condition. The remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel,"
2009,"will, when the beds are upraised, generally be dissolved by the"
2009,percolation of rain water charged with carbonic acid. Some of the many
2009,kinds of animals which live on the beach between high and low water mark
2009,"seem to be rarely preserved. For instance, the several species of the"
2009,Chthamalinae (a sub-family of sessile cirripedes) coat the rocks all
2009,"over the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly littoral, with"
2009,"the exception of a single Mediterranean species, which inhabits deep"
2009,"water and this has been found fossil in Sicily, whereas not one other"
2009,species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is
2009,known that the genus Chthamalus existed during the Chalk period.
2009,"Lastly, many great deposits, requiring a vast length of time for their"
2009,"accumulation, are entirely destitute of organic remains, without our"
2009,being able to assign any reason: one of the most striking instances is
2009,"that of the Flysch formation, which consists of shale and sandstone,"
2009,"several thousand, occasionally even six thousand feet in thickness,"
2009,and extending for at least  miles from Vienna to Switzerland; and
2009,"although this great mass has been most carefully searched, no fossils,"
2009,"except a few vegetable remains, have been found."
2009,
2009,With respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the
2009,"Secondary and Palaeozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that"
2009,"our evidence is fragmentary in an extreme degree. For instance, until"
2009,recently not a land-shell was known belonging to either of these vast
2009,"periods, with the exception of one species discovered by Sir C. Lyell"
2009,and Dr. Dawson in the carboniferous strata of North America; but now
2009,land-shells have been found in the lias. In regard to mammiferous
2009,"remains, a glance at the historical table published in Lyell's"
2009,"Manual, will bring home the truth, how accidental and rare is their"
2009,"preservation, far better than pages of detail. Nor is their rarity"
2009,"surprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of"
2009,tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine
2009,deposits; and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging
2009,to the age of our secondary or palaeozoic formations.
2009,
2009,But the imperfection in the geological record largely results from
2009,"another and more important cause than any of the foregoing; namely, from"
2009,the several formations being separated from each other by wide intervals
2009,of time. This doctrine has been emphatically admitted by many geologists
2009,"and palaeontologists, who, like E. Forbes, entirely disbelieve in the"
2009,change of species. When we see the formations tabulated in written
2009,"works, or when we follow them in nature, it is difficult to avoid"
2009,"believing that they are closely consecutive. But we know, for instance,"
2009,"from Sir R. Murchison's great work on Russia, what wide gaps there are"
2009,in that country between the superimposed formations; so it is in
2009,"North America, and in many other parts of the world. The most skilful"
2009,"geologist, if his attention had been confined exclusively to these large"
2009,"territories, would never have suspected that during the periods which"
2009,"were blank and barren in his own country, great piles of sediment,"
2009,"charged with new and peculiar forms of life, had elsewhere been"
2009,"accumulated. And if, in every separate territory, hardly any idea can be"
2009,formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the consecutive
2009,"formations, we may infer that this could nowhere be ascertained."
2009,The frequent and great changes in the mineralogical composition
2009,"of consecutive formations, generally implying great changes in the"
2009,"geography of the surrounding lands, whence the sediment was derived,"
2009,accord with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed between
2009,each formation.
2009,
2009,"We can, I think, see why the geological formations of each region are"
2009,"almost invariably intermittent; that is, have not followed each other"
2009,in close sequence. Scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many
2009,"hundred miles of the South American coasts, which have been upraised"
2009,"several hundred feet within the recent period, than the absence of"
2009,any recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short
2009,"geological period. Along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by"
2009,"a peculiar marine fauna, tertiary beds are so poorly developed that no"
2009,record of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be
2009,"preserved to a distant age. A little reflection will explain why, along"
2009,"the rising coast of the western side of South America, no extensive"
2009,"formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found, though"
2009,"the supply of sediment must for ages have been great, from the enormous"
2009,degradation of the coast rocks and from the muddy streams entering the
2009,"sea. The explanation, no doubt, is that the littoral and sub-littoral"
2009,"deposits are continually worn away, as soon as they are brought up by"
2009,the slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action of
2009,the coast-waves.
2009,
2009,"We may, I think, conclude that sediment must be accumulated in extremely"
2009,"thick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand the incessant"
2009,"action of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent"
2009,"oscillations of level, as well as the subsequent subaerial degradation."
2009,Such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be formed in two
2009,"ways; either in profound depths of the sea, in which case the bottom"
2009,will not be inhabited by so many and such varied forms of life as the
2009,more shallow seas; and the mass when upraised will give an imperfect
2009,record of the organisms which existed in the neighbourhood during
2009,the period of its accumulation. Or sediment may be deposited to any
2009,"thickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to"
2009,"subside. In this latter case, as long as the rate of subsidence and"
2009,"supply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain"
2009,"shallow and favourable for many and varied forms, and thus a rich"
2009,"fossiliferous formation, thick enough, when upraised, to resist a large"
2009,"amount of denudation, may be formed."
2009,
2009,"I am convinced that nearly all our ancient formations, which are"
2009,"throughout the greater part of their thickness RICH IN FOSSILS, have"
2009,thus been formed during subsidence. Since publishing my views on this
2009,"subject in , I have watched the progress of geology, and have been"
2009,"surprised to note how author after author, in treating of this or that"
2009,"great formation, has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated"
2009,"during subsidence. I may add, that the only ancient tertiary formation"
2009,"on the west coast of South America, which has been bulky enough to"
2009,"resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered, but which will"
2009,"hardly last to a distant geological age, was deposited during a downward"
2009,"oscillation of level, and thus gained considerable thickness."
2009,
2009,All geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone
2009,"numerous slow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations"
2009,"have affected wide spaces. Consequently, formations rich in fossils and"
2009,"sufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation, will"
2009,"have been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only"
2009,where the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and
2009,to embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay. On the
2009,"other hand, as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary, THICK"
2009,"deposits cannot have been accumulated in the shallow parts, which are"
2009,the most favourable to life. Still less can this have happened during
2009,"the alternate periods of elevation; or, to speak more accurately, the"
2009,beds which were then accumulated will generally have been destroyed by
2009,being upraised and brought within the limits of the coast-action.
2009,
2009,These remarks apply chiefly to littoral and sublittoral deposits. In the
2009,"case of an extensive and shallow sea, such as that within a large part"
2009,"of the Malay Archipelago, where the depth varies from thirty or forty"
2009,"to sixty fathoms, a widely extended formation might be formed during"
2009,"a period of elevation, and yet not suffer excessively from denudation"
2009,during its slow upheaval; but the thickness of the formation could not
2009,"be great, for owing to the elevatory movement it would be less than"
2009,the depth in which it was formed; nor would the deposit be much
2009,"consolidated, nor be capped by overlying formations, so that it would"
2009,run a good chance of being worn away by atmospheric degradation and by
2009,"the action of the sea during subsequent oscillations of level. It has,"
2009,"however, been suggested by Mr. Hopkins, that if one part of the area,"
2009,"after rising and before being denuded, subsided, the deposit formed"
2009,"during the rising movement, though not thick, might afterwards become"
2009,"protected by fresh accumulations, and thus be preserved for a long"
2009,period.
2009,
2009,Mr. Hopkins also expresses his belief that sedimentary beds of
2009,considerable horizontal extent have rarely been completely destroyed.
2009,"But all geologists, excepting the few who believe that our present"
2009,metamorphic schists and plutonic rocks once formed the primordial
2009,"nucleus of the globe, will admit that these latter rocks have been"
2009,stripped of their covering to an enormous extent. For it is scarcely
2009,possible that such rocks could have been solidified and crystallised
2009,while uncovered; but if the metamorphic action occurred at profound
2009,"depths of the ocean, the former protecting mantle of rock may not have"
2009,"been very thick. Admitting then that gneiss, mica-schist, granite,"
2009,"diorite, etc., were once necessarily covered up, how can we account for"
2009,"the naked and extensive areas of such rocks in many parts of the world,"
2009,except on the belief that they have subsequently been completely denuded
2009,of all overlying strata? That such extensive areas do exist cannot be
2009,doubted: the granitic region of Parime is described by Humboldt as being
2009,"at least nineteen times as large as Switzerland. South of the Amazon,"
2009,Boue colours an area composed of rocks of this nature as equal to that
2009,"of Spain, France, Italy, part of Germany, and the British Islands, all"
2009,"conjoined. This region has not been carefully explored, but from the"
2009,"concurrent testimony of travellers, the granitic area is very large:"
2009,"thus Von Eschwege gives a detailed section of these rocks, stretching"
2009,from Rio de Janeiro for  geographical miles inland in a straight
2009,"line; and I travelled for  miles in another direction, and saw"
2009,"nothing but granitic rocks. Numerous specimens, collected along the"
2009,"whole coast, from near Rio de Janeiro to the mouth of the Plata, a"
2009,"distance of , geographical miles, were examined by me, and they all"
2009,"belonged to this class. Inland, along the whole northern bank of the"
2009,"Plata, I saw, besides modern tertiary beds, only one small patch of"
2009,"slightly metamorphosed rock, which alone could have formed a part of the"
2009,"original capping of the granitic series. Turning to a well-known region,"
2009,"namely, to the United States and Canada, as shown in Professor H.D."
2009,"Rogers' beautiful map, I have estimated the areas by cutting out and"
2009,"weighing the paper, and I find that the metamorphic (excluding the"
2009,"""semi-metamorphic"") and granite rocks exceed, in the proportion of  to"
2009,"., the whole of the newer Palaeozoic formations. In many regions the"
2009,metamorphic and granite rocks would be found much more widely extended
2009,"than they appear to be, if all the sedimentary beds were removed which"
2009,"rest unconformably on them, and which could not have formed part of"
2009,"the original mantle under which they were crystallised. Hence, it is"
2009,probable that in some parts of the world whole formations have been
2009,"completely denuded, with not a wreck left behind."
2009,
2009,
2009,One remark is here worth a passing notice. During periods of elevation
2009,the area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will
2009,be increased and new stations will often be formed--all circumstances
2009,"favourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new varieties"
2009,and species; but during such periods there will generally be a blank
2009,"in the geological record. On the other hand, during subsidence, the"
2009,inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease (excepting on
2009,"the shores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago), and"
2009,"consequently during subsidence, though there will be much extinction,"
2009,few new varieties or species will be formed; and it is during these very
2009,periods of subsidence that the deposits which are richest in fossils
2009,have been accumulated.
2009,
2009,ON THE ABSENCE OF NUMEROUS INTERMEDIATE VARIETIES IN ANY SINGLE
2009,FORMATION.
2009,
2009,From these several considerations it cannot be doubted that the
2009,"geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if"
2009,"we confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes much more"
2009,difficult to understand why we do not therein find closely graduated
2009,varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and
2009,at its close. Several cases are on record of the same species presenting
2009,varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation. Thus
2009,"Trautschold gives a number of instances with Ammonites, and Hilgendorf"
2009,has described a most curious case of ten graduated forms of Planorbis
2009,multiformis in the successive beds of a fresh-water formation in
2009,Switzerland. Although each formation has indisputably required a vast
2009,"number of years for its deposition, several reasons can be given why"
2009,each should not commonly include a graduated series of links between the
2009,"species which lived at its commencement and close, but I cannot assign"
2009,due proportional weight to the following considerations.
2009,
2009,"Although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each"
2009,probably is short compared with the period requisite to change one
2009,"species into another. I am aware that two palaeontologists, whose"
2009,"opinions are worthy of much deference, namely Bronn and Woodward, have"
2009,concluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice
2009,as long as the average duration of specific forms. But insuperable
2009,"difficulties, as it seems to me, prevent us from coming to any just"
2009,conclusion on this head. When we see a species first appearing in the
2009,"middle of any formation, it would be rash in the extreme to infer"
2009,"that it had not elsewhere previously existed. So again, when we find"
2009,"a species disappearing before the last layers have been deposited, it"
2009,would be equally rash to suppose that it then became extinct. We forget
2009,how small the area of Europe is compared with the rest of the world;
2009,nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout Europe been
2009,correlated with perfect accuracy.
2009,
2009,We may safely infer that with marine animals of all kinds there has been
2009,a large amount of migration due to climatal and other changes; and when
2009,"we see a species first appearing in any formation, the probability is"
2009,"that it only then first immigrated into that area. It is well known, for"
2009,"instance, that several species appear somewhat earlier in the palaeozoic"
2009,beds of North America than in those of Europe; time having apparently
2009,been required for their migration from the American to the European
2009,"seas. In examining the latest deposits, in various quarters of the"
2009,"world, it has everywhere been noted, that some few still existing"
2009,"species are common in the deposit, but have become extinct in the"
2009,"immediately surrounding sea; or, conversely, that some are now abundant"
2009,"in the neighbouring sea, but are rare or absent in this particular"
2009,deposit. It is an excellent lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount
2009,"of migration of the inhabitants of Europe during the glacial epoch,"
2009,which forms only a part of one whole geological period; and likewise to
2009,"reflect on the changes of level, on the extreme change of climate,"
2009,"and on the great lapse of time, all included within this same glacial"
2009,"period. Yet it may be doubted whether, in any quarter of the"
2009,"world, sedimentary deposits, INCLUDING FOSSIL REMAINS, have gone on"
2009,accumulating within the same area during the whole of this period. It is
2009,"not, for instance, probable that sediment was deposited during the whole"
2009,"of the glacial period near the mouth of the Mississippi, within that"
2009,limit of depth at which marine animals can best flourish: for we know
2009,that great geographical changes occurred in other parts of America
2009,during this space of time. When such beds as were deposited in shallow
2009,water near the mouth of the Mississippi during some part of the glacial
2009,"period shall have been upraised, organic remains will probably first"
2009,"appear and disappear at different levels, owing to the migrations"
2009,"of species and to geographical changes. And in the distant future, a"
2009,"geologist, examining these beds, would be tempted to conclude that the"
2009,average duration of life of the embedded fossils had been less than that
2009,"of the glacial period, instead of having been really far greater, that"
2009,"is, extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day."
2009,
2009,In order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper
2009,"and lower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on"
2009,"continuously accumulating during a long period, sufficient for the slow"
2009,"process of modification; hence, the deposit must be a very thick one;"
2009,and the species undergoing change must have lived in the same district
2009,"throughout the whole time. But we have seen that a thick formation,"
2009,"fossiliferous throughout its entire thickness, can accumulate only"
2009,during a period of subsidence; and to keep the depth approximately the
2009,"same, which is necessary that the same marine species may live on the"
2009,"same space, the supply of sediment must nearly counterbalance the"
2009,amount of subsidence. But this same movement of subsidence will tend to
2009,"submerge the area whence the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the"
2009,"supply, whilst the downward movement continues. In fact, this nearly"
2009,exact balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of
2009,subsidence is probably a rare contingency; for it has been observed
2009,by more than one palaeontologist that very thick deposits are usually
2009,"barren of organic remains, except near their upper or lower limits."
2009,
2009,"It would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of"
2009,"formations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its"
2009,"accumulation. When we see, as is so often the case, a formation composed"
2009,"of beds of widely different mineralogical composition, we may"
2009,reasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been more or less
2009,interrupted. Nor will the closest inspection of a formation give us any
2009,idea of the length of time which its deposition may have consumed.
2009,"Many instances could be given of beds, only a few feet in thickness,"
2009,representing formations which are elsewhere thousands of feet in
2009,"thickness, and which must have required an enormous period for their"
2009,accumulation; yet no one ignorant of this fact would have even suspected
2009,the vast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation. Many cases
2009,"could be given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised,"
2009,"denuded, submerged, and then re-covered by the upper beds of the same"
2009,"formation--facts, showing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals"
2009,have occurred in its accumulation. In other cases we have the plainest
2009,"evidence in great fossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew,"
2009,of many long intervals of time and changes of level during the process
2009,"of deposition, which would not have been suspected, had not the trees"
2009,been preserved: thus Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Dawson found carboniferous
2009,"beds , feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient root-bearing strata,"
2009,"one above the other, at no less than sixty-eight different levels."
2009,"Hence, when the same species occurs at the bottom, middle, and top of"
2009,"a formation, the probability is that it has not lived on the same"
2009,"spot during the whole period of deposition, but has disappeared and"
2009,"reappeared, perhaps many times, during the same geological period."
2009,Consequently if it were to undergo a considerable amount of modification
2009,"during the deposition of any one geological formation, a section would"
2009,not include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on our
2009,"theory have existed, but abrupt, though perhaps slight, changes of form."
2009,
2009,It is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule
2009,by which to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little
2009,"variability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater"
2009,"amount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species,"
2009,unless they are enabled to connect them together by the closest
2009,"intermediate gradations; and this, from the reasons just assigned, we"
2009,can seldom hope to effect in any one geological section. Supposing B
2009,"and C to be two species, and a third, A, to be found in an older and"
2009,"underlying bed; even if A were strictly intermediate between B and C,"
2009,"it would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species, unless at the"
2009,same time it could be closely connected by intermediate varieties
2009,"with either one or both forms. Nor should it be forgotten, as before"
2009,"explained, that A might be the actual progenitor of B and C, and yet"
2009,would not necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all
2009,respects. So that we might obtain the parent-species and its several
2009,modified descendants from the lower and upper beds of the same
2009,"formation, and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we"
2009,"should not recognise their blood-relationship, and should consequently"
2009,rank them as distinct species.
2009,
2009,It is notorious on what excessively slight differences many
2009,palaeontologists have founded their species; and they do this the more
2009,readily if the specimens come from different sub-stages of the same
2009,formation. Some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the
2009,very fine species of D'Orbigny and others into the rank of varieties;
2009,and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on
2009,"the theory we ought to find. Look again at the later tertiary deposits,"
2009,which include many shells believed by the majority of naturalists to
2009,"be identical with existing species; but some excellent naturalists,"
2009,"as Agassiz and Pictet, maintain that all these tertiary species are"
2009,"specifically distinct, though the distinction is admitted to be very"
2009,"slight; so that here, unless we believe that these eminent naturalists"
2009,"have been misled by their imaginations, and that these late tertiary"
2009,species really present no difference whatever from their living
2009,"representatives, or unless we admit, in opposition to the judgment of"
2009,"most naturalists, that these tertiary species are all truly distinct"
2009,"from the recent, we have evidence of the frequent occurrence of slight"
2009,modifications of the kind required. If we look to rather wider intervals
2009,"of time, namely, to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great"
2009,"formation, we find that the embedded fossils, though universally ranked"
2009,"as specifically different, yet are far more closely related to each"
2009,other than are the species found in more widely separated formations;
2009,so that here again we have undoubted evidence of change in the direction
2009,required by the theory; but to this latter subject I shall return in the
2009,following chapter.
2009,
2009,With animals and plants that propagate rapidly and do not wander
2009,"much, there is reason to suspect, as we have formerly seen, that their"
2009,varieties are generally at first local; and that such local varieties
2009,do not spread widely and supplant their parent-form until they have been
2009,modified and perfected in some considerable degree. According to this
2009,"view, the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country all"
2009,"the early stages of transition between any two forms, is small, for the"
2009,successive changes are supposed to have been local or confined to some
2009,one spot. Most marine animals have a wide range; and we have seen that
2009,"with plants it is those which have the widest range, that oftenest"
2009,"present varieties, so that, with shells and other marine animals, it is"
2009,"probable that those which had the widest range, far exceeding the limits"
2009,"of the known geological formations in Europe, have oftenest given rise,"
2009,first to local varieties and ultimately to new species; and this again
2009,would greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of
2009,transition in any one geological formation.
2009,
2009,"It is a more important consideration, leading to the same result, as"
2009,"lately insisted on by Dr. Falconer, namely, that the period during which"
2009,"each species underwent modification, though long as measured by years,"
2009,was probably short in comparison with that during which it remained
2009,without undergoing any change.
2009,
2009,"It should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with perfect"
2009,"specimens for examination, two forms can seldom be connected by"
2009,"intermediate varieties, and thus proved to be the same species, until"
2009,many specimens are collected from many places; and with fossil
2009,"species this can rarely be done. We shall, perhaps, best perceive the"
2009,"improbability of our being enabled to connect species by numerous, fine,"
2009,"intermediate, fossil links, by asking ourselves whether, for instance,"
2009,geologists at some future period will be able to prove that our
2009,"different breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, and dogs are descended from"
2009,"a single stock or from several aboriginal stocks; or, again, whether"
2009,"certain sea-shells inhabiting the shores of North America, which are"
2009,ranked by some conchologists as distinct species from their European
2009,"representatives, and by other conchologists as only varieties, are"
2009,"really varieties, or are, as it is called, specifically distinct. This"
2009,could be effected by the future geologist only by his discovering in
2009,a fossil state numerous intermediate gradations; and such success is
2009,improbable in the highest degree.
2009,
2009,"It has been asserted over and over again, by writers who believe in"
2009,"the immutability of species, that geology yields no linking forms. This"
2009,"assertion, as we shall see in the next chapter, is certainly erroneous."
2009,"As Sir J. Lubbock has remarked, ""Every species is a link between other"
2009,"allied forms."" If we take a genus having a score of species, recent"
2009,"and extinct, and destroy four-fifths of them, no one doubts that the"
2009,remainder will stand much more distinct from each other. If the extreme
2009,"forms in the genus happen to have been thus destroyed, the genus itself"
2009,will stand more distinct from other allied genera. What geological
2009,"research has not revealed, is the former existence of infinitely"
2009,"numerous gradations, as fine as existing varieties, connecting together"
2009,nearly all existing and extinct species. But this ought not to be
2009,expected; yet this has been repeatedly advanced as a most serious
2009,objection against my views.
2009,
2009,It may be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks on the causes
2009,of the imperfection of the geological record under an imaginary
2009,illustration. The Malay Archipelago is about the size of Europe from
2009,"the North Cape to the Mediterranean, and from Britain to Russia; and"
2009,therefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined
2009,"with any accuracy, excepting those of the United States of America. I"
2009,"fully agree with Mr. Godwin-Austen, that the present condition of the"
2009,"Malay Archipelago, with its numerous large islands separated by wide and"
2009,"shallow seas, probably represents the former state of Europe, while most"
2009,of our formations were accumulating. The Malay Archipelago is one of
2009,the richest regions in organic beings; yet if all the species were to
2009,"be collected which have ever lived there, how imperfectly would they"
2009,represent the natural history of the world!
2009,
2009,But we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of
2009,the archipelago would be preserved in an extremely imperfect manner in
2009,the formations which we suppose to be there accumulating. Not many
2009,"of the strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on naked"
2009,"submarine rocks, would be embedded; and those embedded in gravel or"
2009,sand would not endure to a distant epoch. Wherever sediment did not
2009,"accumulate on the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a"
2009,"sufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could"
2009,be preserved.
2009,
2009,"Formations rich in fossils of many kinds, and of thickness sufficient to"
2009,last to an age as distant in futurity as the secondary formations lie
2009,"in the past, would generally be formed in the archipelago only during"
2009,periods of subsidence. These periods of subsidence would be separated
2009,"from each other by immense intervals of time, during which the area"
2009,"would be either stationary or rising; whilst rising, the fossiliferous"
2009,"formations on the steeper shores would be destroyed, almost as soon as"
2009,"accumulated, by the incessant coast-action, as we now see on the shores"
2009,of South America. Even throughout the extensive and shallow seas within
2009,"the archipelago, sedimentary beds could hardly be accumulated of"
2009,"great thickness during the periods of elevation, or become capped"
2009,"and protected by subsequent deposits, so as to have a good chance of"
2009,"enduring to a very distant future. During the periods of subsidence,"
2009,there would probably be much extinction of life; during the periods
2009,"of elevation, there would be much variation, but the geological record"
2009,would then be less perfect.
2009,
2009,It may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of
2009,"subsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with"
2009,"a contemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would EXCEED the average"
2009,duration of the same specific forms; and these contingencies are
2009,indispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations
2009,between any two or more species. If such gradations were not all fully
2009,"preserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many new,"
2009,though closely allied species. It is also probable that each great
2009,"period of subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level,"
2009,and that slight climatical changes would intervene during such lengthy
2009,periods; and in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would
2009,"migrate, and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could"
2009,be preserved in any one formation.
2009,
2009,Very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range
2009,thousands of miles beyond its confines; and analogy plainly leads to the
2009,"belief that it would be chiefly these far-ranging species, though"
2009,"only some of them, which would oftenest produce new varieties; and"
2009,"the varieties would at first be local or confined to one place, but"
2009,"if possessed of any decided advantage, or when further modified and"
2009,"improved, they would slowly spread and supplant their parent-forms. When"
2009,"such varieties returned to their ancient homes, as they would differ"
2009,"from their former state in a nearly uniform, though perhaps extremely"
2009,"slight degree, and as they would be found embedded in slightly"
2009,"different sub-stages of the same formation, they would, according to"
2009,"the principles followed by many palaeontologists, be ranked as new and"
2009,distinct species.
2009,
2009,"If then there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no right"
2009,"to expect to find, in our geological formations, an infinite number of"
2009,"those fine transitional forms, which, on our theory, have connected"
2009,all the past and present species of the same group into one long and
2009,"branching chain of life. We ought only to look for a few links, and such"
2009,"assuredly we do find--some more distantly, some more closely, related"
2009,"to each other; and these links, let them be ever so close, if found in"
2009,"different stages of the same formation, would, by many palaeontologists,"
2009,be ranked as distinct species. But I do not pretend that I should ever
2009,have suspected how poor was the record in the best preserved geological
2009,"sections, had not the absence of innumerable transitional links between"
2009,"the species which lived at the commencement and close of each formation,"
2009,pressed so hardly on my theory.
2009,
2009,ON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF WHOLE GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES.
2009,
2009,The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in
2009,"certain formations, has been urged by several palaeontologists--for"
2009,"instance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and Sedgwick, as a fatal objection to the"
2009,"belief in the transmutation of species. If numerous species, belonging"
2009,"to the same genera or families, have really started into life at once,"
2009,the fact would be fatal to the theory of evolution through natural
2009,"selection. For the development by this means of a group of forms, all"
2009,"of which are descended from some one progenitor, must have been an"
2009,extremely slow process; and the progenitors must have lived long before
2009,their modified descendants. But we continually overrate the perfection
2009,"of the geological record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or"
2009,"families have not been found beneath a certain stage, that they did not"
2009,exist before that stage. In all cases positive palaeontological evidence
2009,"may be implicitly trusted; negative evidence is worthless, as experience"
2009,"has so often shown. We continually forget how large the world is,"
2009,compared with the area over which our geological formations have been
2009,carefully examined; we forget that groups of species may elsewhere
2009,"have long existed, and have slowly multiplied, before they invaded the"
2009,ancient archipelagoes of Europe and the United States. We do not make
2009,due allowance for the enormous intervals of time which have elapsed
2009,"between our consecutive formations, longer perhaps in many cases"
2009,than the time required for the accumulation of each formation. These
2009,intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species from
2009,"some one parent-form: and in the succeeding formation, such groups or"
2009,species will appear as if suddenly created.
2009,
2009,"I may here recall a remark formerly made, namely, that it might require"
2009,a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar
2009,"line of life, for instance, to fly through the air; and consequently"
2009,that the transitional forms would often long remain confined to some one
2009,"region; but that, when this adaptation had once been effected, and a"
2009,"few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms,"
2009,a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent
2009,"forms, which would spread rapidly and widely throughout the world."
2009,"Professor Pictet, in his excellent Review of this work, in commenting"
2009,"on early transitional forms, and taking birds as an illustration, cannot"
2009,see how the successive modifications of the anterior limbs of a supposed
2009,prototype could possibly have been of any advantage. But look at the
2009,penguins of the Southern Ocean; have not these birds their front limbs
2009,"in this precise intermediate state of ""neither true arms nor true"
2009,"wings?"" Yet these birds hold their place victoriously in the battle for"
2009,life; for they exist in infinite numbers and of many kinds. I do not
2009,suppose that we here see the real transitional grades through which
2009,the wings of birds have passed; but what special difficulty is there in
2009,"believing that it might profit the modified descendants of the penguin,"
2009,first to become enabled to flap along the surface of the sea like the
2009,"logger-headed duck, and ultimately to rise from its surface and glide"
2009,through the air?
2009,
2009,"I will now give a few examples to illustrate the foregoing remarks, and"
2009,to show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of
2009,species have suddenly been produced. Even in so short an interval as
2009,that between the first and second editions of Pictet's great work on
2009,"Palaeontology, published in - and in -, the conclusions on"
2009,the first appearance and disappearance of several groups of animals
2009,have been considerably modified; and a third edition would require still
2009,further changes. I may recall the well-known fact that in geological
2009,"treatises, published not many years ago, mammals were always spoken of"
2009,as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series.
2009,And now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals belongs
2009,to the middle of the secondary series; and true mammals have been
2009,discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of
2009,this great series. Cuvier used to urge that no monkey occurred in any
2009,"tertiary stratum; but now extinct species have been discovered in India,"
2009,"South America and in Europe, as far back as the miocene stage. Had it"
2009,not been for the rare accident of the preservation of footsteps in
2009,"the new red sandstone of the United States, who would have ventured to"
2009,"suppose that no less than at least thirty different bird-like animals,"
2009,"some of gigantic size, existed during that period? Not a fragment of"
2009,"bone has been discovered in these beds. Not long ago, palaeontologists"
2009,maintained that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence
2009,"during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of Professor"
2009,"Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper"
2009,"greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the Archeopteryx,"
2009,"with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint,"
2009,"and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in"
2009,the oolitic slates of Solenhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more
2009,forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants
2009,of the world.
2009,
2009,"I may give another instance, which, from having passed under my own eyes"
2009,"has much struck me. In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes, I stated"
2009,"that, from the large number of existing and extinct tertiary species;"
2009,from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species
2009,"all over the world, from the Arctic regions to the equator, inhabiting"
2009,"various zones of depths, from the upper tidal limits to fifty fathoms;"
2009,from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest
2009,tertiary beds; from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve
2009,"can be recognised; from all these circumstances, I inferred that, had"
2009,"sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary periods, they would"
2009,certainly have been preserved and discovered; and as not one species had
2009,"then been discovered in beds of this age, I concluded that this great"
2009,group had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary
2009,"series. This was a sore trouble to me, adding, as I then thought, one"
2009,more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species. But
2009,"my work had hardly been published, when a skilful palaeontologist, M."
2009,"Bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakable"
2009,"sessile cirripede, which he had himself extracted from the chalk of"
2009,"Belgium. And, as if to make the case as striking as possible, this"
2009,"cirripede was a Chthamalus, a very common, large, and ubiquitous genus,"
2009,of which not one species has as yet been found even in any tertiary
2009,"stratum. Still more recently, a Pyrgoma, a member of a distinct"
2009,"subfamily of sessile cirripedes, has been discovered by Mr. Woodward in"
2009,the upper chalk; so that we now have abundant evidence of the existence
2009,of this group of animals during the secondary period.
2009,
2009,The case most frequently insisted on by palaeontologists of the
2009,"apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the"
2009,"teleostean fishes, low down, according to Agassiz, in the Chalk period."
2009,This group includes the large majority of existing species. But certain
2009,Jurassic and Triassic forms are now commonly admitted to be teleostean;
2009,and even some palaeozoic forms have thus been classed by one high
2009,authority. If the teleosteans had really appeared suddenly in the
2009,"northern hemisphere at the commencement of the chalk formation, the"
2009,fact would have been highly remarkable; but it would not have formed an
2009,"insuperable difficulty, unless it could likewise have been shown that at"
2009,the same period the species were suddenly and simultaneously developed
2009,in other quarters of the world. It is almost superfluous to remark
2009,that hardly any fossil-fish are known from south of the equator; and
2009,by running through Pictet's Palaeontology it will be seen that very few
2009,species are known from several formations in Europe. Some few families
2009,of fish now have a confined range; the teleostean fishes might formerly
2009,"have had a similarly confined range, and after having been largely"
2009,"developed in some one sea, have spread widely. Nor have we any right to"
2009,suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from
2009,"south to north as they are at present. Even at this day, if the Malay"
2009,"Archipelago were converted into land, the tropical parts of the Indian"
2009,"Ocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any"
2009,great group of marine animals might be multiplied; and here they would
2009,"remain confined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler"
2009,"climate, and were enabled to double the southern capes of Africa or"
2009,"Australia, and thus reach other and distant seas."
2009,
2009,"From these considerations, from our ignorance of the geology of other"
2009,"countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States, and"
2009,from the revolution in our palaeontological knowledge effected by the
2009,"discoveries of the last dozen years, it seems to me to be about as rash"
2009,"to dogmatize on the succession of organic forms throughout the world, as"
2009,it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on a barren
2009,"point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its"
2009,productions.
2009,
2009,ON THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF GROUPS OF ALLIED SPECIES IN THE LOWEST KNOWN
2009,FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA.
2009,
2009,"There is another and allied difficulty, which is much more serious. I"
2009,allude to the manner in which species belonging to several of the main
2009,divisions of the animal kingdom suddenly appear in the lowest known
2009,fossiliferous rocks. Most of the arguments which have convinced me that
2009,all the existing species of the same group are descended from a single
2009,"progenitor, apply with equal force to the earliest known species."
2009,"For instance, it cannot be doubted that all the Cambrian and Silurian"
2009,"trilobites are descended from some one crustacean, which must have lived"
2009,"long before the Cambrian age, and which probably differed greatly from"
2009,"any known animal. Some of the most ancient animals, as the Nautilus,"
2009,"Lingula, etc., do not differ much from living species; and it cannot on"
2009,"our theory be supposed, that these old species were the progenitors of"
2009,all the species belonging to the same groups which have subsequently
2009,"appeared, for they are not in any degree intermediate in character."
2009,
2009,"Consequently, if the theory be true, it is indisputable that before the"
2009,"lowest Cambrian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed, as long as,"
2009,"or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Cambrian age"
2009,to the present day; and that during these vast periods the world swarmed
2009,with living creatures. Here we encounter a formidable objection; for it
2009,"seems doubtful whether the earth, in a fit state for the habitation of"
2009,"living creatures, has lasted long enough. Sir W. Thompson concludes that"
2009,the consolidation of the crust can hardly have occurred less than twenty
2009,"or more than four hundred million years ago, but probably not less than"
2009,ninety-eight or more than two hundred million years. These very wide
2009,limits show how doubtful the data are; and other elements may have
2009,hereafter to be introduced into the problem. Mr. Croll estimates that
2009,"about sixty million years have elapsed since the Cambrian period,"
2009,"but this, judging from the small amount of organic change since the"
2009,"commencement of the Glacial epoch, appears a very short time for the"
2009,"many and great mutations of life, which have certainly occurred since"
2009,the Cambrian formation; and the previous one hundred and forty million
2009,years can hardly be considered as sufficient for the development of the
2009,varied forms of life which already existed during the Cambrian period.
2009,"It is, however, probable, as Sir William Thompson insists, that the"
2009,world at a very early period was subjected to more rapid and violent
2009,changes in its physical conditions than those now occurring; and such
2009,changes would have tended to induce changes at a corresponding rate in
2009,the organisms which then existed.
2009,
2009,To the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging
2009,"to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system, I can"
2009,"give no satisfactory answer. Several eminent geologists, with Sir R."
2009,"Murchison at their head, were until recently convinced that we beheld"
2009,in the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum the first dawn
2009,"of life. Other highly competent judges, as Lyell and E. Forbes, have"
2009,disputed this conclusion. We should not forget that only a small portion
2009,of the world is known with accuracy. Not very long ago M. Barrande
2009,"added another and lower stage, abounding with new and peculiar species,"
2009,"beneath the then known Silurian system; and now, still lower down in the"
2009,"Lower Cambrian formation, Mr Hicks has found South Wales beds rich in"
2009,"trilobites, and containing various molluscs and annelids. The presence"
2009,"of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter, even in some of the"
2009,"lowest azotic rocks, probably indicates life at these periods; and"
2009,the existence of the Eozoon in the Laurentian formation of Canada is
2009,generally admitted. There are three great series of strata beneath the
2009,"Silurian system in Canada, in the lowest of which the Eozoon is found."
2009,"Sir W. Logan states that their ""united thickness may possibly far"
2009,"surpass that of all the succeeding rocks, from the base of the"
2009,palaeozoic series to the present time. We are thus carried back to a
2009,"period so remote, that the appearance of the so-called primordial"
2009,fauna (of Barrande) may by some be considered as a comparatively modern
2009,"event."" The Eozoon belongs to the most lowly organised of all classes of"
2009,"animals, but is highly organised for its class; it existed in countless"
2009,"numbers, and, as Dr. Dawson has remarked, certainly preyed on other"
2009,"minute organic beings, which must have lived in great numbers. Thus the"
2009,"words, which I wrote in , about the existence of living beings long"
2009,"before the Cambrian period, and which are almost the same with those"
2009,"since used by Sir W. Logan, have proved true. Nevertheless, the"
2009,difficulty of assigning any good reason for the absence of vast piles
2009,of strata rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian system is very great. It
2009,does not seem probable that the most ancient beds have been quite worn
2009,"away by denudation, or that their fossils have been wholly obliterated"
2009,"by metamorphic action, for if this had been the case we should have"
2009,found only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in
2009,"age, and these would always have existed in a partially metamorphosed"
2009,condition. But the descriptions which we possess of the Silurian
2009,"deposits over immense territories in Russia and in North America, do not"
2009,support the view that the older a formation is the more invariably it
2009,has suffered extreme denudation and metamorphism.
2009,
2009,The case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as
2009,a valid argument against the views here entertained. To show that it
2009,"may hereafter receive some explanation, I will give the following"
2009,hypothesis. From the nature of the organic remains which do not appear
2009,"to have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe"
2009,"and of the United States; and from the amount of sediment, miles in"
2009,"thickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from"
2009,"first to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was"
2009,"derived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the now existing continents"
2009,of Europe and North America. This same view has since been maintained by
2009,Agassiz and others. But we do not know what was the state of things in
2009,the intervals between the several successive formations; whether Europe
2009,"and the United States during these intervals existed as dry land, or as"
2009,"a submarine surface near land, on which sediment was not deposited, or"
2009,as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea.
2009,
2009,"Looking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the"
2009,"land, we see them studded with many islands; but hardly one truly"
2009,"oceanic island (with the exception of New Zealand, if this can be called"
2009,a truly oceanic island) is as yet known to afford even a remnant of any
2009,"palaeozoic or secondary formation. Hence, we may perhaps infer, that"
2009,"during the palaeozoic and secondary periods, neither continents nor"
2009,continental islands existed where our oceans now extend; for had they
2009,"existed, palaeozoic and secondary formations would in all probability"
2009,have been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear;
2009,and would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of
2009,"level, which must have intervened during these enormously long periods."
2009,"If, then, we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that,"
2009,"where our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest"
2009,"period of which we have any record; and on the other hand, that where"
2009,"continents now exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected, no"
2009,"doubt, to great oscillations of level, since the Cambrian period. The"
2009,"coloured map appended to my volume on Coral Reefs, led me to conclude"
2009,"that the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence, the great"
2009,"archipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level, and the continents"
2009,areas of elevation. But we have no reason to assume that things have
2009,thus remained from the beginning of the world. Our continents seem to
2009,"have been formed by a preponderance, during many oscillations of"
2009,"level, of the force of elevation. But may not the areas of preponderant"
2009,movement have changed in the lapse of ages? At a period long antecedent
2009,"to the Cambrian epoch, continents may have existed where oceans are"
2009,"now spread out, and clear and open oceans may have existed where our"
2009,"continents now stand. Nor should we be justified in assuming that if,"
2009,"for instance, the bed of the Pacific Ocean were now converted into a"
2009,"continent we should there find sedimentary formations, in recognisable"
2009,"condition, older than the Cambrian strata, supposing such to have been"
2009,formerly deposited; for it might well happen that strata which had
2009,"subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth, and which had"
2009,"been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water, might"
2009,have undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always
2009,remained nearer to the surface. The immense areas in some parts of the
2009,"world, for instance in South America, of naked metamorphic rocks, which"
2009,"must have been heated under great pressure, have always seemed to me to"
2009,require some special explanation; and we may perhaps believe that we see
2009,in these large areas the many formations long anterior to the Cambrian
2009,epoch in a completely metamorphosed and denuded condition.
2009,
2009,"The several difficulties here discussed, namely, that, though we find in"
2009,our geological formations many links between the species which now exist
2009,"and which formerly existed, we do not find infinitely numerous fine"
2009,transitional forms closely joining them all together. The sudden
2009,manner in which several groups of species first appear in our European
2009,"formations, the almost entire absence, as at present known, of"
2009,"formations rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian strata, are all"
2009,undoubtedly of the most serious nature. We see this in the fact that
2009,"the most eminent palaeontologists, namely, Cuvier, Agassiz, Barrande,"
2009,"Pictet, Falconer, E. Forbes, etc., and all our greatest geologists, as"
2009,"Lyell, Murchison, Sedgwick, etc., have unanimously, often vehemently,"
2009,maintained the immutability of species. But Sir Charles Lyell now
2009,"gives the support of his high authority to the opposite side, and most"
2009,geologists and palaeontologists are much shaken in their former belief.
2009,"Those who believe that the geological record is in any degree perfect,"
2009,"will undoubtedly at once reject my theory. For my part, following out"
2009,"Lyell's metaphor, I look at the geological record as a history of"
2009,the world imperfectly kept and written in a changing dialect. Of this
2009,"history we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three"
2009,"countries. Of this volume, only here and there a short chapter has been"
2009,"preserved, and of each page, only here and there a few lines. Each"
2009,"word of the slowly-changing language, more or less different in the"
2009,"successive chapters, may represent the forms of life, which are entombed"
2009,"in our consecutive formations, and which falsely appear to have been"
2009,abruptly introduced. On this view the difficulties above discussed are
2009,greatly diminished or even disappear.

2009,CHAPTER XI. ON THE GEOLOGICAL SUCCESSION OF ORGANIC BEINGS.
2009,
2009, On the slow and successive appearance of new species--On their different
2009, rates of change--Species once lost do not reappear--Groups of species
2009, follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as
2009, do single species--On extinction--On simultaneous changes in the forms
2009, of life throughout the world--On the affinities of extinct species to
2009, each other and to living species--On the state of development of
2009, ancient forms--On the succession of the same types within the same
2009, areas--Summary of preceding and present chapters.
2009,
2009,
2009,Let us now see whether the several facts and laws relating to the
2009,geological succession of organic beings accord best with the common view
2009,"of the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and gradual"
2009,"modification, through variation and natural selection."
2009,
2009,"New species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on the"
2009,land and in the waters. Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to
2009,resist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary
2009,"stages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks between the stages,"
2009,and to make the proportion between the lost and existing forms more
2009,"gradual. In some of the most recent beds, though undoubtedly of high"
2009,"antiquity if measured by years, only one or two species are extinct,"
2009,"and only one or two are new, having appeared there for the first time,"
2009,"either locally, or, as far as we know, on the face of the earth. The"
2009,"secondary formations are more broken; but, as Bronn has remarked,"
2009,neither the appearance nor disappearance of the many species embedded in
2009,each formation has been simultaneous.
2009,
2009,Species belonging to different genera and classes have not changed at
2009,"the same rate, or in the same degree. In the older tertiary beds a few"
2009,living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct
2009,"forms. Falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, for an"
2009,existing crocodile is associated with many lost mammals and reptiles in
2009,the sub-Himalayan deposits. The Silurian Lingula differs but little from
2009,the living species of this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian
2009,Molluscs and all the Crustaceans have changed greatly. The productions
2009,of the land seem to have changed at a quicker rate than those of the
2009,"sea, of which a striking instance has been observed in Switzerland."
2009,"There is some reason to believe that organisms high in the scale, change"
2009,more quickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to
2009,"this rule. The amount of organic change, as Pictet has remarked, is not"
2009,the same in each successive so-called formation. Yet if we compare any
2009,"but the most closely related formations, all the species will be found"
2009,to have undergone some change. When a species has once disappeared
2009,"from the face of the earth, we have no reason to believe that the same"
2009,identical form ever reappears. The strongest apparent exception to this
2009,"latter rule is that of the so-called ""colonies"" of M. Barrande, which"
2009,"intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation, and then allow"
2009,"the pre-existing fauna to reappear; but Lyell's explanation, namely,"
2009,that it is a case of temporary migration from a distinct geographical
2009,"province, seems satisfactory."
2009,
2009,"These several facts accord well with our theory, which includes no fixed"
2009,"law of development, causing all the inhabitants of an area to change"
2009,"abruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. The process of"
2009,"modification must be slow, and will generally affect only a few species"
2009,at the same time; for the variability of each species is independent of
2009,that of all others. Whether such variations or individual differences as
2009,may arise will be accumulated through natural selection in a greater
2009,"or less degree, thus causing a greater or less amount of permanent"
2009,"modification, will depend on many complex contingencies--on"
2009,"the variations being of a beneficial nature, on the freedom of"
2009,"intercrossing, on the slowly changing physical conditions of the"
2009,"country, on the immigration of new colonists, and on the nature of the"
2009,other inhabitants with which the varying species come into competition.
2009,Hence it is by no means surprising that one species should retain the
2009,"same identical form much longer than others; or, if changing, should"
2009,change in a less degree. We find similar relations between the existing
2009,"inhabitants of distinct countries; for instance, the land-shells and"
2009,coleopterous insects of Madeira have come to differ considerably from
2009,"their nearest allies on the continent of Europe, whereas the marine"
2009,shells and birds have remained unaltered. We can perhaps understand
2009,the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly
2009,"organised productions compared with marine and lower productions, by"
2009,the more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and
2009,"inorganic conditions of life, as explained in a former chapter. When"
2009,"many of the inhabitants of any area have become modified and improved,"
2009,"we can understand, on the principle of competition, and from the"
2009,all-important relations of organism to organism in the struggle for
2009,"life, that any form which did not become in some degree modified and"
2009,"improved, would be liable to extermination. Hence, we see why all"
2009,"the species in the same region do at last, if we look to long enough"
2009,"intervals of time, become modified; for otherwise they would become"
2009,extinct.
2009,
2009,"In members of the same class the average amount of change, during long"
2009,"and equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the"
2009,"accumulation of enduring formations, rich in fossils, depends on great"
2009,"masses of sediment being deposited on subsiding areas, our formations"
2009,have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly
2009,intermittent intervals of time; consequently the amount of organic
2009,change exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations
2009,"is not equal. Each formation, on this view, does not mark a new and"
2009,"complete act of creation, but only an occasional scene, taken almost at"
2009,"hazard, in an ever slowly changing drama."
2009,
2009,We can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never
2009,"reappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and"
2009,"inorganic, should recur. For though the offspring of one species might"
2009,be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances)
2009,"to fill the place of another species in the economy of nature, and"
2009,thus supplant it; yet the two forms--the old and the new--would not be
2009,identically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different
2009,characters from their distinct progenitors; and organisms already
2009,"differing would vary in a different manner. For instance, it is"
2009,"possible, if all our fantail-pigeons were destroyed, that fanciers might"
2009,make a new breed hardly distinguishable from the present breed; but if
2009,"the parent rock-pigeon were likewise destroyed, and under nature we have"
2009,every reason to believe that parent forms are generally supplanted
2009,"and exterminated by their improved offspring, it is incredible that a"
2009,"fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any"
2009,"other species of pigeon, or even from any other well established race"
2009,"of the domestic pigeon, for the successive variations would almost"
2009,"certainly be in some degree different, and the newly-formed variety"
2009,would probably inherit from its progenitor some characteristic
2009,differences.
2009,
2009,"Groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general"
2009,"rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species,"
2009,"changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser degree. A"
2009,"group, when it has once disappeared, never reappears; that is, its"
2009,"existence, as long as it lasts, is continuous. I am aware that there"
2009,"are some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions are"
2009,"surprisingly few, so few that E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward (though"
2009,all strongly opposed to such views as I maintain) admit its truth; and
2009,the rule strictly accords with the theory. For all the species of
2009,"the same group, however long it may have lasted, are the modified"
2009,"descendants one from the other, and all from a common progenitor. In"
2009,"the genus Lingula, for instance, the species which have successively"
2009,appeared at all ages must have been connected by an unbroken series of
2009,"generations, from the lowest Silurian stratum to the present day."
2009,
2009,We have seen in the last chapter that whole groups of species sometimes
2009,falsely appear to have been abruptly developed; and I have attempted
2009,"to give an explanation of this fact, which if true would be fatal to my"
2009,views. But such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being
2009,"a gradual increase in number, until the group reaches its maximum, and"
2009,"then, sooner or later, a gradual decrease. If the number of the species"
2009,"included within a genus, or the number of the genera within a family, be"
2009,"represented by a vertical line of varying thickness, ascending through"
2009,"the successive geological formations, in which the species are found,"
2009,"the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end, not in"
2009,"a sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens upwards, often"
2009,"keeping of equal thickness for a space, and ultimately thins out in the"
2009,"upper beds, marking the decrease and final extinction of the species."
2009,This gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly
2009,"conformable with the theory; for the species of the same genus, and the"
2009,"genera of the same family, can increase only slowly and progressively;"
2009,the process of modification and the production of a number of allied
2009,"forms necessarily being a slow and gradual process, one species first"
2009,"giving rise to two or three varieties, these being slowly converted"
2009,"into species, which in their turn produce by equally slow steps other"
2009,"varieties and species, and so on, like the branching of a great tree"
2009,"from a single stem, till the group becomes large."
2009,
2009,ON EXTINCTION.
2009,
2009,We have as yet only spoken incidentally of the disappearance of species
2009,"and of groups of species. On the theory of natural selection, the"
2009,extinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are
2009,intimately connected together. The old notion of all the inhabitants of
2009,the earth having been swept away by catastrophes at successive periods
2009,"is very generally given up, even by those geologists, as Elie de"
2009,"Beaumont, Murchison, Barrande, etc., whose general views would naturally"
2009,"lead them to this conclusion. On the contrary, we have every reason to"
2009,"believe, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and"
2009,"groups of species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one"
2009,"spot, then from another, and finally from the world. In some few cases,"
2009,"however, as by the breaking of an isthmus and the consequent irruption"
2009,"of a multitude of new inhabitants into an adjoining sea, or by the final"
2009,"subsidence of an island, the process of extinction may have been rapid."
2009,Both single species and whole groups of species last for very unequal
2009,"periods; some groups, as we have seen, have endured from the earliest"
2009,known dawn of life to the present day; some have disappeared before
2009,the close of the palaeozoic period. No fixed law seems to determine
2009,the length of time during which any single species or any single genus
2009,endures. There is reason to believe that the extinction of a whole group
2009,of species is generally a slower process than their production: if their
2009,"appearance and disappearance be represented, as before, by a vertical"
2009,line of varying thickness the line is found to taper more gradually at
2009,"its upper end, which marks the progress of extermination, than at its"
2009,"lower end, which marks the first appearance and the early increase in"
2009,"number of the species. In some cases, however, the extermination of"
2009,"whole groups, as of ammonites, towards the close of the secondary"
2009,"period, has been wonderfully sudden."
2009,
2009,The extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous
2009,"mystery. Some authors have even supposed that, as the individual has a"
2009,"definite length of life, so have species a definite duration. No one can"
2009,have marvelled more than I have done at the extinction of species. When
2009,I found in La Plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of
2009,"Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon and other extinct monsters, which all"
2009,"co-existed with still living shells at a very late geological period,"
2009,"I was filled with astonishment; for, seeing that the horse, since its"
2009,"introduction by the Spaniards into South America, has run wild over the"
2009,"whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate, I"
2009,asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former horse
2009,under conditions of life apparently so favourable. But my astonishment
2009,"was groundless. Professor Owen soon perceived that the tooth, though"
2009,"so like that of the existing horse, belonged to an extinct species. Had"
2009,"this horse been still living, but in some degree rare, no naturalist"
2009,would have felt the least surprise at its rarity; for rarity is the
2009,"attribute of a vast number of species of all classes, in all countries."
2009,"If we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare, we answer that"
2009,something is unfavourable in its conditions of life; but what that
2009,"something is, we can hardly ever tell. On the supposition of the fossil"
2009,"horse still existing as a rare species, we might have felt certain, from"
2009,"the analogy of all other mammals, even of the slow-breeding elephant,"
2009,and from the history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in
2009,"South America, that under more favourable conditions it would in a very"
2009,few years have stocked the whole continent. But we could not have
2009,"told what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase,"
2009,"whether some one or several contingencies, and at what period of the"
2009,"horse's life, and in what degree they severally acted. If the conditions"
2009,"had gone on, however slowly, becoming less and less favourable, we"
2009,"assuredly should not have perceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would"
2009,"certainly have become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct--its place"
2009,being seized on by some more successful competitor.
2009,
2009,It is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every
2009,living creature is constantly being checked by unperceived hostile
2009,agencies; and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient
2009,"to cause rarity, and finally extinction. So little is this subject"
2009,"understood, that I have heard surprise repeatedly expressed at such"
2009,great monsters as the Mastodon and the more ancient Dinosaurians having
2009,become extinct; as if mere bodily strength gave victory in the battle of
2009,"life. Mere size, on the contrary, would in some cases determine, as has"
2009,"been remarked by Owen, quicker extermination, from the greater amount"
2009,"of requisite food. Before man inhabited India or Africa, some cause must"
2009,have checked the continued increase of the existing elephant. A highly
2009,"capable judge, Dr. Falconer, believes that it is chiefly insects which,"
2009,"from incessantly harassing and weakening the elephant in India, check"
2009,its increase; and this was Bruce's conclusion with respect to
2009,the African elephant in Abyssinia. It is certain that insects and
2009,blood-sucking bats determine the existence of the larger naturalised
2009,quadrupeds in several parts of South America.
2009,
2009,We see in many cases in the more recent tertiary formations that rarity
2009,precedes extinction; and we know that this has been the progress of
2009,"events with those animals which have been exterminated, either locally"
2009,"or wholly, through man's agency. I may repeat what I published in ,"
2009,"namely, that to admit that species generally become rare before they"
2009,"become extinct--to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species, and yet"
2009,"to marvel greatly when the species ceases to exist, is much the same as"
2009,to admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death--to
2009,"feel no surprise at sickness, but, when the sick man dies, to wonder and"
2009,to suspect that he died by some deed of violence.
2009,
2009,The theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new
2009,"variety and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by"
2009,having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition;
2009,and the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably
2009,follows. It is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and
2009,"slightly improved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the"
2009,less improved varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it
2009,"is transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the"
2009,place of other breeds in other countries. Thus the appearance of new
2009,"forms and the disappearance of old forms, both those naturally and"
2009,"artificially produced, are bound together. In flourishing groups, the"
2009,number of new specific forms which have been produced within a given
2009,time has at some periods probably been greater than the number of
2009,the old specific forms which have been exterminated; but we know that
2009,"species have not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least during the"
2009,"later geological epochs, so that, looking to later times, we may believe"
2009,that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the
2009,same number of old forms.
2009,
2009,"The competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained"
2009,"and illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each"
2009,other in all respects. Hence the improved and modified descendants of
2009,a species will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species;
2009,"and if many new forms have been developed from any one species, the"
2009,"nearest allies of that species, i.e. the species of the same genus, will"
2009,"be the most liable to extermination. Thus, as I believe, a number of"
2009,"new species descended from one species, that is a new genus, comes to"
2009,"supplant an old genus, belonging to the same family. But it must often"
2009,have happened that a new species belonging to some one group has seized
2009,"on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group, and"
2009,thus have caused its extermination. If many allied forms be developed
2009,"from the successful intruder, many will have to yield their places;"
2009,"and it will generally be the allied forms, which will suffer from some"
2009,inherited inferiority in common. But whether it be species belonging
2009,"to the same or to a distinct class, which have yielded their places to"
2009,"other modified and improved species, a few of the sufferers may often"
2009,"be preserved for a long time, from being fitted to some peculiar line of"
2009,"life, or from inhabiting some distant and isolated station, where they"
2009,"will have escaped severe competition. For instance, some species of"
2009,"Trigonia, a great genus of shells in the secondary formations, survive"
2009,in the Australian seas; and a few members of the great and almost
2009,extinct group of Ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters.
2009,"Therefore, the utter extinction of a group is generally, as we have"
2009,"seen, a slower process than its production."
2009,
2009,With respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or
2009,"orders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palaeozoic period, and of"
2009,"Ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what"
2009,has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our
2009,consecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been
2009,"much slow extermination. Moreover, when, by sudden immigration or by"
2009,"unusually rapid development, many species of a new group have taken"
2009,"possession of an area, many of the older species will have been"
2009,exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner; and the forms which thus
2009,"yield their places will commonly be allied, for they will partake of the"
2009,same inferiority in common.
2009,
2009,"Thus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole"
2009,groups of species become extinct accords well with the theory of natural
2009,"selection. We need not marvel at extinction; if we must marvel, let it"
2009,be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand
2009,the many complex contingencies on which the existence of each species
2009,depends. If we forget for an instant that each species tends to increase
2009,"inordinately, and that some check is always in action, yet seldom"
2009,"perceived by us, the whole economy of nature will be utterly obscured."
2009,Whenever we can precisely say why this species is more abundant
2009,in individuals than that; why this species and not another can be
2009,"naturalised in a given country; then, and not until then, we may justly"
2009,feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of any particular
2009,species or group of species.
2009,
2009,ON THE FORMS OF LIFE CHANGING ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE
2009,WORLD.
2009,
2009,Scarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than the fact
2009,that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the
2009,world. Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many
2009,"distant regions, under the most different climates, where not a fragment"
2009,"of the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in North America, in"
2009,"equatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape of Good Hope,"
2009,"and in the peninsula of India. For at these distant points, the organic"
2009,remains in certain beds present an unmistakable resemblance to those
2009,of the Chalk. It is not that the same species are met with; for in some
2009,"cases not one species is identically the same, but they belong to"
2009,"the same families, genera, and sections of genera, and sometimes are"
2009,similarly characterised in such trifling points as mere superficial
2009,"sculpture. Moreover, other forms, which are not found in the Chalk of"
2009,"Europe, but which occur in the formations either above or below, occur"
2009,in the same order at these distant points of the world. In the several
2009,"successive palaeozoic formations of Russia, Western Europe and North"
2009,"America, a similar parallelism in the forms of life has been observed"
2009,"by several authors; so it is, according to Lyell, with the European and"
2009,North American tertiary deposits. Even if the few fossil species which
2009,"are common to the Old and New Worlds were kept wholly out of view, the"
2009,"general parallelism in the successive forms of life, in the palaeozoic"
2009,"and tertiary stages, would still be manifest, and the several formations"
2009,could be easily correlated.
2009,
2009,"These observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of the"
2009,world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions
2009,of the land and of fresh water at distant points change in the same
2009,parallel manner. We may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the
2009,"Megatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought"
2009,"to Europe from La Plata, without any information in regard to their"
2009,"geological position, no one would have suspected that they had"
2009,co-existed with sea-shells all still living; but as these anomalous
2009,"monsters co-existed with the Mastodon and Horse, it might at least"
2009,have been inferred that they had lived during one of the later tertiary
2009,stages.
2009,
2009,When the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed
2009,"simultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this"
2009,"expression relates to the same year, or even to the same century, or"
2009,even that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine
2009,"animals now living in Europe, and all those that lived in Europe during"
2009,"the pleistocene period (a very remote period as measured by years,"
2009,including the whole glacial epoch) were compared with those now existing
2009,"in South America or in Australia, the most skilful naturalist would"
2009,hardly be able to say whether the present or the pleistocene inhabitants
2009,"of Europe resembled most closely those of the southern hemisphere. So,"
2009,"again, several highly competent observers maintain that the existing"
2009,productions of the United States are more closely related to those which
2009,"lived in Europe during certain late tertiary stages, than to the"
2009,"present inhabitants of Europe; and if this be so, it is evident that"
2009,fossiliferous beds now deposited on the shores of North America would
2009,hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older European beds.
2009,"Nevertheless, looking to a remotely future epoch, there can be little"
2009,"doubt that all the more modern MARINE formations, namely, the upper"
2009,"pliocene, the pleistocene and strictly modern beds of Europe, North and"
2009,"South America, and Australia, from containing fossil remains in some"
2009,"degree allied, and from not including those forms which are found"
2009,"only in the older underlying deposits, would be correctly ranked as"
2009,simultaneous in a geological sense.
2009,
2009,The fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously in the above large
2009,"sense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck those admirable"
2009,"observers, MM. de Verneuil and d'Archiac. After referring to the"
2009,"parallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life in various parts of Europe,"
2009,"they add, ""If struck by this strange sequence, we turn our attention to"
2009,"North America, and there discover a series of analogous phenomena,"
2009,"it will appear certain that all these modifications of species, their"
2009,"extinction, and the introduction of new ones, cannot be owing to mere"
2009,changes in marine currents or other causes more or less local and
2009,"temporary, but depend on general laws which govern the whole animal"
2009,"kingdom."" M. Barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the same"
2009,"effect. It is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of currents,"
2009,"climate, or other physical conditions, as the cause of these great"
2009,"mutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the most"
2009,"different climates. We must, as Barrande has remarked, look to some"
2009,special law. We shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present
2009,"distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the relation"
2009,between the physical conditions of various countries and the nature of
2009,their inhabitants.
2009,
2009,This great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life
2009,"throughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural selection."
2009,New species are formed by having some advantage over older forms; and
2009,"the forms, which are already dominant, or have some advantage over the"
2009,"other forms in their own country, give birth to the greatest number of"
2009,new varieties or incipient species. We have distinct evidence on this
2009,"head, in the plants which are dominant, that is, which are commonest and"
2009,"most widely diffused, producing the greatest number of new varieties."
2009,"It is also natural that the dominant, varying and far-spreading species,"
2009,"which have already invaded, to a certain extent, the territories of"
2009,"other species, should be those which would have the best chance of"
2009,"spreading still further, and of giving rise in new countries to other"
2009,new varieties and species. The process of diffusion would often be
2009,"very slow, depending on climatal and geographical changes, on strange"
2009,"accidents, and on the gradual acclimatization of new species to the"
2009,"various climates through which they might have to pass, but in the"
2009,course of time the dominant forms would generally succeed in spreading
2009,"and would ultimately prevail. The diffusion would, it is probable, be"
2009,slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with
2009,the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea. We might therefore expect
2009,"to find, as we do find, a less strict degree of parallelism in the"
2009,succession of the productions of the land than with those of the sea.
2009,
2009,"Thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense,"
2009,"simultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the world,"
2009,accords well with the principle of new species having been formed by
2009,dominant species spreading widely and varying; the new species thus
2009,"produced being themselves dominant, owing to their having had some"
2009,"advantage over their already dominant parents, as well as over other"
2009,"species; and again spreading, varying, and producing new forms. The"
2009,old forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and
2009,"victorious forms, will generally be allied in groups, from inheriting"
2009,"some inferiority in common; and, therefore, as new and improved groups"
2009,"spread throughout the world, old groups disappear from the world; and"
2009,the succession of forms everywhere tends to correspond both in their
2009,first appearance and final disappearance.
2009,
2009,There is one other remark connected with this subject worth making. I
2009,"have given my reasons for believing that most of our great formations,"
2009,"rich in fossils, were deposited during periods of subsidence; and that"
2009,"blank intervals of vast duration, as far as fossils are concerned,"
2009,occurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was either
2009,"stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was not thrown down"
2009,quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains. During these
2009,long and blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants of each region
2009,"underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction, and"
2009,that there was much migration from other parts of the world. As we have
2009,"reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement,"
2009,it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been
2009,accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world;
2009,but we are very far from having any right to conclude that this has
2009,"invariably been the case, and that large areas have invariably been"
2009,affected by the same movements. When two formations have been deposited
2009,"in two regions during nearly, but not exactly, the same period,"
2009,"we should find in both, from the causes explained in the foregoing"
2009,"paragraphs, the same general succession in the forms of life; but the"
2009,species would not exactly correspond; for there will have been a
2009,"little more time in the one region than in the other for modification,"
2009,"extinction, and immigration."
2009,
2009,"I suspect that cases of this nature occur in Europe. Mr. Prestwich, in"
2009,"his admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England and France, is"
2009,able to draw a close general parallelism between the successive stages
2009,in the two countries; but when he compares certain stages in England
2009,"with those in France, although he finds in both a curious accordance in"
2009,"the numbers of the species belonging to the same genera, yet the species"
2009,themselves differ in a manner very difficult to account for considering
2009,"the proximity of the two areas, unless, indeed, it be assumed that an"
2009,"isthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous"
2009,faunas. Lyell has made similar observations on some of the later
2009,"tertiary formations. Barrande, also, shows that there is a striking"
2009,general parallelism in the successive Silurian deposits of Bohemia and
2009,Scandinavia; nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in
2009,the species. If the several formations in these regions have not been
2009,deposited during the same exact periods--a formation in one region often
2009,corresponding with a blank interval in the other--and if in both regions
2009,the species have gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the
2009,several formations and during the long intervals of time between them;
2009,in this case the several formations in the two regions could be arranged
2009,"in the same order, in accordance with the general succession of the"
2009,"forms of life, and the order would falsely appear to be strictly"
2009,parallel; nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the
2009,apparently corresponding stages in the two regions.
2009,
2009,"ON THE AFFINITIES OF EXTINCT SPECIES TO EACH OTHER, AND TO LIVING FORMS."
2009,
2009,Let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species.
2009,All fall into a few grand classes; and this fact is at once explained on
2009,"the principle of descent. The more ancient any form is, the more, as a"
2009,"general rule, it differs from living forms. But, as Buckland long ago"
2009,"remarked, extinct species can all be classed either in still existing"
2009,"groups, or between them. That the extinct forms of life help to fill"
2009,"up the intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, is"
2009,certainly true; but as this statement has often been ignored or even
2009,"denied, it may be well to make some remarks on this subject, and to give"
2009,some instances. If we confine our attention either to the living or to
2009,"the extinct species of the same class, the series is far less perfect"
2009,than if we combine both into one general system. In the writings of
2009,Professor Owen we continually meet with the expression of generalised
2009,"forms, as applied to extinct animals; and in the writings of Agassiz, of"
2009,prophetic or synthetic types; and these terms imply that such forms
2009,"are, in fact, intermediate or connecting links. Another distinguished"
2009,"palaeontologist, M. Gaudry, has shown in the most striking manner that"
2009,many of the fossil mammals discovered by him in Attica serve to break
2009,down the intervals between existing genera. Cuvier ranked the Ruminants
2009,and Pachyderms as two of the most distinct orders of mammals; but so
2009,many fossil links have been disentombed that Owen has had to alter the
2009,"whole classification, and has placed certain Pachyderms in the same"
2009,"sub-order with ruminants; for example, he dissolves by gradations the"
2009,apparently wide interval between the pig and the camel. The Ungulata
2009,or hoofed quadrupeds are now divided into the even-toed or odd-toed
2009,divisions; but the Macrauchenia of South America connects to a certain
2009,extent these two grand divisions. No one will deny that the Hipparion
2009,is intermediate between the existing horse and certain other ungulate
2009,forms. What a wonderful connecting link in the chain of mammals is the
2009,"Typotherium from South America, as the name given to it by Professor"
2009,"Gervais expresses, and which cannot be placed in any existing order. The"
2009,"Sirenia form a very distinct group of the mammals, and one of the most"
2009,remarkable peculiarities in existing dugong and lamentin is the entire
2009,"absence of hind limbs, without even a rudiment being left; but the"
2009,"extinct Halitherium had, according to Professor Flower, an ossified"
2009,"thigh-bone ""articulated to a well-defined acetabulum in the pelvis,"" and"
2009,"it thus makes some approach to ordinary hoofed quadrupeds, to which the"
2009,Sirenia are in other respects allied. The cetaceans or whales are
2009,"widely different from all other mammals, but the tertiary Zeuglodon and"
2009,"Squalodon, which have been placed by some naturalists in an order"
2009,"by themselves, are considered by Professor Huxley to be undoubtedly"
2009,"cetaceans, ""and to constitute connecting links with the aquatic"
2009,"carnivora."""
2009,
2009,Even the wide interval between birds and reptiles has been shown by
2009,the naturalist just quoted to be partially bridged over in the
2009,"most unexpected manner, on the one hand, by the ostrich and extinct"
2009,"Archeopteryx, and on the other hand by the Compsognathus, one of"
2009,the Dinosaurians--that group which includes the most gigantic of all
2009,"terrestrial reptiles. Turning to the Invertebrata, Barrande asserts, a"
2009,"higher authority could not be named, that he is every day taught that,"
2009,although palaeozoic animals can certainly be classed under existing
2009,"groups, yet that at this ancient period the groups were not so"
2009,distinctly separated from each other as they now are.
2009,
2009,"Some writers have objected to any extinct species, or group of species,"
2009,"being considered as intermediate between any two living species, or"
2009,groups of species. If by this term it is meant that an extinct form is
2009,directly intermediate in all its characters between two living forms or
2009,"groups, the objection is probably valid. But in a natural classification"
2009,"many fossil species certainly stand between living species, and some"
2009,"extinct genera between living genera, even between genera belonging to"
2009,"distinct families. The most common case, especially with respect to very"
2009,"distinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be that, supposing"
2009,"them to be distinguished at the present day by a score of characters,"
2009,the ancient members are separated by a somewhat lesser number of
2009,"characters, so that the two groups formerly made a somewhat nearer"
2009,approach to each other than they now do.
2009,
2009,"It is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much the"
2009,more it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely
2009,separated from each other. This remark no doubt must be restricted
2009,to those groups which have undergone much change in the course of
2009,geological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the truth of
2009,"the proposition, for every now and then even a living animal, as the"
2009,"Lepidosiren, is discovered having affinities directed towards very"
2009,"distinct groups. Yet if we compare the older Reptiles and Batrachians,"
2009,"the older Fish, the older Cephalopods, and the eocene Mammals, with the"
2009,"recent members of the same classes, we must admit that there is truth in"
2009,the remark.
2009,
2009,Let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the
2009,"theory of descent with modification. As the subject is somewhat complex,"
2009,I must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter.
2009,"We may suppose that the numbered letters in italics represent genera,"
2009,and the dotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus. The
2009,"diagram is much too simple, too few genera and too few species being"
2009,"given, but this is unimportant for us. The horizontal lines may"
2009,"represent successive geological formations, and all the forms beneath"
2009,the uppermost line may be considered as extinct. The three existing
2009,"genera, a, q, p, will form a small family; b and f, a closely"
2009,"allied family or subfamily; and o, i, m, a third family. These"
2009,"three families, together with the many extinct genera on the several"
2009,lines of descent diverging from the parent form (A) will form an order;
2009,for all will have inherited something in common from their ancient
2009,progenitor. On the principle of the continued tendency to divergence
2009,"of character, which was formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more"
2009,recent any form is the more it will generally differ from its ancient
2009,"progenitor. Hence, we can understand the rule that the most ancient"
2009,"fossils differ most from existing forms. We must not, however, assume"
2009,that divergence of character is a necessary contingency; it depends
2009,solely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize
2009,on many and different places in the economy of nature. Therefore it is
2009,"quite possible, as we have seen in the case of some Silurian forms,"
2009,that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its
2009,"slightly altered conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast"
2009,period the same general characteristics. This is represented in the
2009,diagram by the letter F.
2009,
2009,"All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from (A), make, as"
2009,"before remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects"
2009,"of extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into"
2009,"several sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have"
2009,"perished at different periods, and some to have endured to the present"
2009,day.
2009,
2009,By looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms
2009,"supposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered"
2009,"at several points low down in the series, the three existing families on"
2009,"the uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other. If,"
2009,"for instance, the genera a, a, a, f, m, m, m, were disinterred,"
2009,these three families would be so closely linked together that they
2009,"probably would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the"
2009,same manner as has occurred with ruminants and certain pachyderms. Yet
2009,"he who objected to consider as intermediate the extinct genera, which"
2009,"thus link together the living genera of three families, would be partly"
2009,"justified, for they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long"
2009,and circuitous course through many widely different forms. If many
2009,extinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal
2009,"lines or geological formations--for instance, above No. VI.--but none"
2009,"from beneath this line, then only two of the families (those on the left"
2009,"hand a, etc., and b, etc.) would have to be united into one; and"
2009,there would remain two families which would be less distinct from each
2009,"other than they were before the discovery of the fossils. So again, if"
2009,"the three families formed of eight genera (a to m), on the uppermost"
2009,"line, be supposed to differ from each other by half-a-dozen important"
2009,"characters, then the families which existed at a period marked VI would"
2009,certainly have differed from each other by a less number of characters;
2009,for they would at this early stage of descent have diverged in a less
2009,degree from their common progenitor. Thus it comes that ancient and
2009,extinct genera are often in a greater or less degree intermediate
2009,"in character between their modified descendants, or between their"
2009,collateral relations.
2009,
2009,Under nature the process will be far more complicated than is
2009,represented in the diagram; for the groups will have been more numerous;
2009,"they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of time, and will"
2009,have been modified in various degrees. As we possess only the last
2009,"volume of the geological record, and that in a very broken condition,"
2009,"we have no right to expect, except in rare cases, to fill up the wide"
2009,"intervals in the natural system, and thus to unite distinct families or"
2009,"orders. All that we have a right to expect is, that those groups which"
2009,"have, within known geological periods, undergone much modification,"
2009,should in the older formations make some slight approach to each other;
2009,so that the older members should differ less from each other in some of
2009,their characters than do the existing members of the same groups;
2009,and this by the concurrent evidence of our best palaeontologists is
2009,frequently the case.
2009,
2009,"Thus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts with"
2009,respect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each
2009,"other and to living forms, are explained in a satisfactory manner. And"
2009,they are wholly inexplicable on any other view.
2009,
2009,"On this same theory, it is evident that the fauna during any one great"
2009,period in the earth's history will be intermediate in general character
2009,between that which preceded and that which succeeded it. Thus the
2009,species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram
2009,"are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and"
2009,are the parents of those which became still more modified at the
2009,seventh stage; hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in
2009,"character between the forms of life above and below. We must, however,"
2009,"allow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms, and in any one"
2009,"region for the immigration of new forms from other regions, and for a"
2009,large amount of modification during the long and blank intervals between
2009,"the successive formations. Subject to these allowances, the fauna of"
2009,"each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character, between"
2009,"the preceding and succeeding faunas. I need give only one instance,"
2009,"namely, the manner in which the fossils of the Devonian system,"
2009,"when this system was first discovered, were at once recognised by"
2009,palaeontologists as intermediate in character between those of the
2009,overlying carboniferous and underlying Silurian systems. But each fauna
2009,"is not necessarily exactly intermediate, as unequal intervals of time"
2009,have elapsed between consecutive formations.
2009,
2009,It is no real objection to the truth of the statement that the fauna of
2009,each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the
2009,"preceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions"
2009,"to the rule. For instance, the species of mastodons and elephants, when"
2009,arranged by Dr. Falconer in two series--in the first place according
2009,"to their mutual affinities, and in the second place according to their"
2009,periods of existence--do not accord in arrangement. The species extreme
2009,in character are not the oldest or the most recent; nor are those which
2009,"are intermediate in character, intermediate in age. But supposing for"
2009,"an instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of the first"
2009,"appearance and disappearance of the species was complete, which is far"
2009,"from the case, we have no reason to believe that forms successively"
2009,produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time. A very
2009,ancient form may occasionally have lasted much longer than a form
2009,"elsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of terrestrial"
2009,productions inhabiting separated districts. To compare small things with
2009,great; if the principal living and extinct races of the domestic pigeon
2009,"were arranged in serial affinity, this arrangement would not closely"
2009,"accord with the order in time of their production, and even less with"
2009,the order of their disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon still
2009,lives; and many varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier
2009,have become extinct; and carriers which are extreme in the important
2009,character of length of beak originated earlier than short-beaked
2009,"tumblers, which are at the opposite end of the series in this respect."
2009,
2009,"Closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an"
2009,"intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character,"
2009,"is the fact, insisted on by all palaeontologists, that fossils from two"
2009,"consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other, than"
2009,are the fossils from two remote formations. Pictet gives as a well-known
2009,"instance, the general resemblance of the organic remains from the"
2009,"several stages of the Chalk formation, though the species are distinct"
2009,"in each stage. This fact alone, from its generality, seems to have"
2009,shaken Professor Pictet in his belief in the immutability of species.
2009,He who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species over the
2009,"globe, will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of distinct"
2009,"species in closely consecutive formations, by the physical conditions of"
2009,the ancient areas having remained nearly the same. Let it be remembered
2009,"that the forms of life, at least those inhabiting the sea, have changed"
2009,"almost simultaneously throughout the world, and therefore under the most"
2009,different climates and conditions. Consider the prodigious vicissitudes
2009,"of climate during the pleistocene period, which includes the whole"
2009,"glacial epoch, and note how little the specific forms of the inhabitants"
2009,of the sea have been affected.
2009,
2009,"On the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fossil remains from"
2009,"closely consecutive formations, being closely related, though ranked as"
2009,"distinct species, is obvious. As the accumulation of each formation"
2009,"has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened"
2009,"between successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as"
2009,"I attempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or in any two"
2009,"formations, all the intermediate varieties between the species which"
2009,appeared at the commencement and close of these periods: but we ought
2009,"to find after intervals, very long as measured by years, but only"
2009,"moderately long as measured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as"
2009,"they have been called by some authors, representative species; and these"
2009,"assuredly we do find. We find, in short, such evidence of the slow and"
2009,"scarcely sensible mutations of specific forms, as we have the right to"
2009,expect.
2009,
2009,ON THE STATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF ANCIENT COMPARED WITH LIVING FORMS.
2009,
2009,We have seen in the fourth chapter that the degree of differentiation
2009,"and specialisation of the parts in organic beings, when arrived at"
2009,"maturity, is the best standard, as yet suggested, of their degree of"
2009,"perfection or highness. We have also seen that, as the specialisation of"
2009,"parts is an advantage to each being, so natural selection will tend to"
2009,"render the organisation of each being more specialised and perfect,"
2009,and in this sense higher; not but that it may leave many creatures with
2009,"simple and unimproved structures fitted for simple conditions of life,"
2009,"and in some cases will even degrade or simplify the organisation, yet"
2009,leaving such degraded beings better fitted for their new walks of life.
2009,"In another and more general manner, new species become superior to their"
2009,predecessors; for they have to beat in the struggle for life all
2009,"the older forms, with which they come into close competition. We may"
2009,therefore conclude that if under a nearly similar climate the eocene
2009,inhabitants of the world could be put into competition with the existing
2009,"inhabitants, the former would be beaten and exterminated by the"
2009,"latter, as would the secondary by the eocene, and the palaeozoic by"
2009,the secondary forms. So that by this fundamental test of victory in the
2009,"battle for life, as well as by the standard of the specialisation of"
2009,"organs, modern forms ought, on the theory of natural selection, to"
2009,stand higher than ancient forms. Is this the case? A large majority of
2009,palaeontologists would answer in the affirmative; and it seems that this
2009,"answer must be admitted as true, though difficult of proof."
2009,
2009,"It is no valid objection to this conclusion, that certain Brachiopods"
2009,have been but slightly modified from an extremely remote geological
2009,epoch; and that certain land and fresh-water shells have remained nearly
2009,"the same, from the time when, as far as is known, they first appeared."
2009,"It is not an insuperable difficulty that Foraminifera have not, as"
2009,"insisted on by Dr. Carpenter, progressed in organisation since even the"
2009,Laurentian epoch; for some organisms would have to remain fitted for
2009,"simple conditions of life, and what could be better fitted for this end"
2009,than these lowly organised Protozoa? Such objections as the above
2009,"would be fatal to my view, if it included advance in organisation as"
2009,"a necessary contingent. They would likewise be fatal, if the above"
2009,"Foraminifera, for instance, could be proved to have first come into"
2009,"existence during the Laurentian epoch, or the above Brachiopods during"
2009,"the Cambrian formation; for in this case, there would not have been time"
2009,sufficient for the development of these organisms up to the standard
2009,"which they had then reached. When advanced up to any given point, there"
2009,"is no necessity, on the theory of natural selection, for their further"
2009,"continued process; though they will, during each successive age, have to"
2009,"be slightly modified, so as to hold their places in relation to slight"
2009,changes in their conditions. The foregoing objections hinge on the
2009,"question whether we really know how old the world is, and at what period"
2009,the various forms of life first appeared; and this may well be disputed.
2009,
2009,The problem whether organisation on the whole has advanced is in
2009,"many ways excessively intricate. The geological record, at all times"
2009,"imperfect, does not extend far enough back to show with unmistakable"
2009,clearness that within the known history of the world organisation has
2009,"largely advanced. Even at the present day, looking to members of the"
2009,"same class, naturalists are not unanimous which forms ought to be ranked"
2009,"as highest: thus, some look at the selaceans or sharks, from their"
2009,"approach in some important points of structure to reptiles, as the"
2009,highest fish; others look at the teleosteans as the highest. The ganoids
2009,stand intermediate between the selaceans and teleosteans; the latter
2009,at the present day are largely preponderant in number; but formerly
2009,"selaceans and ganoids alone existed; and in this case, according to"
2009,"the standard of highness chosen, so will it be said that fishes have"
2009,advanced or retrograded in organisation. To attempt to compare members
2009,of distinct types in the scale of highness seems hopeless; who will
2009,decide whether a cuttle-fish be higher than a bee--that insect which
2009,"the great Von Baer believed to be ""in fact more highly organised than a"
2009,"fish, although upon another type?"" In the complex struggle for life it"
2009,"is quite credible that crustaceans, not very high in their own class,"
2009,"might beat cephalopods, the highest molluscs; and such crustaceans,"
2009,"though not highly developed, would stand very high in the scale of"
2009,"invertebrate animals, if judged by the most decisive of all trials--the"
2009,law of battle. Beside these inherent difficulties in deciding which
2009,"forms are the most advanced in organisation, we ought not solely to"
2009,compare the highest members of a class at any two periods--though
2009,undoubtedly this is one and perhaps the most important element in
2009,"striking a balance--but we ought to compare all the members, high"
2009,"and low, at two periods. At an ancient epoch the highest and lowest"
2009,"molluscoidal animals, namely, cephalopods and brachiopods, swarmed in"
2009,"numbers; at the present time both groups are greatly reduced,"
2009,"while others, intermediate in organisation, have largely increased;"
2009,consequently some naturalists maintain that molluscs were formerly more
2009,highly developed than at present; but a stronger case can be made out on
2009,"the opposite side, by considering the vast reduction of brachiopods, and"
2009,"the fact that our existing cephalopods, though few in number, are more"
2009,highly organised than their ancient representatives. We ought also to
2009,"compare the relative proportional numbers, at any two periods, of the"
2009,"high and low classes throughout the world: if, for instance, at the"
2009,"present day fifty thousand kinds of vertebrate animals exist, and if"
2009,"we knew that at some former period only ten thousand kinds existed, we"
2009,"ought to look at this increase in number in the highest class, which"
2009,"implies a great displacement of lower forms, as a decided advance in the"
2009,organisation of the world. We thus see how hopelessly difficult it is to
2009,"compare with perfect fairness, under such extremely complex relations,"
2009,the standard of organisation of the imperfectly-known faunas of
2009,successive periods.
2009,
2009,We shall appreciate this difficulty more clearly by looking to certain
2009,existing faunas and floras. From the extraordinary manner in which
2009,"European productions have recently spread over New Zealand, and have"
2009,seized on places which must have been previously occupied by the
2009,"indigenes, we must believe, that if all the animals and plants of Great"
2009,"Britain were set free in New Zealand, a multitude of British forms would"
2009,"in the course of time become thoroughly naturalized there, and would"
2009,"exterminate many of the natives. On the other hand, from the fact that"
2009,hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere has become wild in
2009,"any part of Europe, we may well doubt whether, if all the productions"
2009,"of New Zealand were set free in Great Britain, any considerable number"
2009,would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by our native plants
2009,"and animals. Under this point of view, the productions of Great Britain"
2009,stand much higher in the scale than those of New Zealand. Yet the
2009,"most skilful naturalist, from an examination of the species of the two"
2009,"countries, could not have foreseen this result."
2009,
2009,Agassiz and several other highly competent judges insist that ancient
2009,animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals
2009,belonging to the same classes; and that the geological succession of
2009,extinct forms is nearly parallel with the embryological development of
2009,existing forms. This view accords admirably well with our theory. In a
2009,future chapter I shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its
2009,"embryo, owing to variations having supervened at a not early age, and"
2009,"having been inherited at a corresponding age. This process, whilst it"
2009,"leaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of"
2009,"successive generations, more and more difference to the adult. Thus the"
2009,"embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of"
2009,the former and less modified condition of the species. This view may be
2009,"true, and yet may never be capable of proof. Seeing, for instance, that"
2009,"the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fishes strictly belong to their"
2009,"proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree"
2009,less distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same
2009,"groups at the present day, it would be vain to look for animals having"
2009,"the common embryological character of the Vertebrata, until beds rich"
2009,in fossils are discovered far beneath the lowest Cambrian strata--a
2009,discovery of which the chance is small.
2009,
2009,"ON THE SUCCESSION OF THE SAME TYPES WITHIN THE SAME AREAS, DURING THE"
2009,LATER TERTIARY PERIODS.
2009,
2009,Mr. Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the
2009,Australian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that
2009,"continent. In South America, a similar relationship is manifest, even to"
2009,"an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour, like those of the"
2009,"armadillo, found in several parts of La Plata; and Professor Owen has"
2009,"shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals,"
2009,"buried there in such numbers, are related to South American types. This"
2009,relationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of
2009,fossil bones made by MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil. I was
2009,"so much impressed with these facts that I strongly insisted, in "
2009,"and , on this ""law of the succession of types,""--on ""this wonderful"
2009,"relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living."""
2009,Professor Owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to
2009,the mammals of the Old World. We see the same law in this author's
2009,restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of New Zealand. We see
2009,it also in the birds of the caves of Brazil. Mr. Woodward has shown that
2009,"the same law holds good with sea-shells, but, from the wide distribution"
2009,"of most molluscs, it is not well displayed by them. Other cases could"
2009,"be added, as the relation between the extinct and living land-shells of"
2009,Madeira; and between the extinct and living brackish water-shells of the
2009,Aralo-Caspian Sea.
2009,
2009,"Now, what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types"
2009,"within the same areas mean? He would be a bold man who, after comparing"
2009,"the present climate of Australia and of parts of South America, under"
2009,"the same latitude, would attempt to account, on the one hand through"
2009,"dissimilar physical conditions, for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants"
2009,"of these two continents; and, on the other hand through similarity"
2009,"of conditions, for the uniformity of the same types in each continent"
2009,during the later tertiary periods. Nor can it be pretended that it is
2009,an immutable law that marsupials should have been chiefly or solely
2009,produced in Australia; or that Edentata and other American types should
2009,have been solely produced in South America. For we know that Europe in
2009,ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials; and I have shown
2009,"in the publications above alluded to, that in America the law of"
2009,distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what it
2009,now is. North America formerly partook strongly of the present character
2009,of the southern half of the continent; and the southern half was
2009,"formerly more closely allied, than it is at present, to the northern"
2009,"half. In a similar manner we know, from Falconer and Cautley's"
2009,"discoveries, that Northern India was formerly more closely related in"
2009,its mammals to Africa than it is at the present time. Analogous facts
2009,could be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals.
2009,
2009,"On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long"
2009,"enduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the"
2009,"same areas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of each quarter of"
2009,"the world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter, during the next"
2009,"succeeding period of time, closely allied though in some degree modified"
2009,descendants. If the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed
2009,"greatly from those of another continent, so will their modified"
2009,descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree. But
2009,"after very long intervals of time, and after great geographical changes,"
2009,"permitting much intermigration, the feebler will yield to the more"
2009,"dominant forms, and there will be nothing immutable in the distribution"
2009,of organic beings.
2009,
2009,It may be asked in ridicule whether I suppose that the megatherium and
2009,"other allied huge monsters, which formerly lived in South America, have"
2009,"left behind them the sloth, armadillo, and anteater, as their degenerate"
2009,descendants. This cannot for an instant be admitted. These huge animals
2009,"have become wholly extinct, and have left no progeny. But in the caves"
2009,of Brazil there are many extinct species which are closely allied in
2009,size and in all other characters to the species still living in South
2009,America; and some of these fossils may have been the actual progenitors
2009,"of the living species. It must not be forgotten that, on our theory, all"
2009,the species of the same genus are the descendants of some one species;
2009,"so that, if six genera, each having eight species, be found in one"
2009,"geological formation, and in a succeeding formation there be six other"
2009,"allied or representative genera, each with the same number of species,"
2009,then we may conclude that generally only one species of each of the
2009,"older genera has left modified descendants, which constitute the new"
2009,genera containing the several species; the other seven species of each
2009,"old genus having died out and left no progeny. Or, and this will be a"
2009,"far commoner case, two or three species in two or three alone of the six"
2009,older genera will be the parents of the new genera: the other species
2009,and the other old genera having become utterly extinct. In failing
2009,"orders, with the genera and species decreasing in numbers as is the case"
2009,"with the Edentata of South America, still fewer genera and species will"
2009,leave modified blood-descendants.
2009,
2009,SUMMARY OF THE PRECEDING AND PRESENT CHAPTERS.
2009,
2009,I have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely
2009,imperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically
2009,explored with care; that only certain classes of organic beings have
2009,been largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number both of
2009,"specimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is absolutely as"
2009,nothing compared with the number of generations which must have passed
2009,"away even during a single formation; that, owing to subsidence being"
2009,almost necessary for the accumulation of deposits rich in fossil species
2009,"of many kinds, and thick enough to outlast future degradation, great"
2009,intervals of time must have elapsed between most of our successive
2009,formations; that there has probably been more extinction during
2009,"the periods of subsidence, and more variation during the periods"
2009,"of elevation, and during the latter the record will have been least"
2009,perfectly kept; that each single formation has not been continuously
2009,deposited; that the duration of each formation is probably short
2009,compared with the average duration of specific forms; that migration has
2009,played an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any
2009,one area and formation; that widely ranging species are those which have
2009,"varied most frequently, and have oftenest given rise to new species;"
2009,"that varieties have at first been local; and lastly, although each"
2009,"species must have passed through numerous transitional stages, it is"
2009,"probable that the periods, during which each underwent modification,"
2009,"though many and long as measured by years, have been short in comparison"
2009,with the periods during which each remained in an unchanged condition.
2009,"These causes, taken conjointly, will to a large extent explain"
2009,why--though we do find many links--we do not find interminable
2009,"varieties, connecting together all extinct and existing forms by the"
2009,finest graduated steps. It should also be constantly borne in mind that
2009,"any linking variety between two forms, which might be found, would be"
2009,"ranked, unless the whole chain could be perfectly restored, as a new"
2009,and distinct species; for it is not pretended that we have any sure
2009,criterion by which species and varieties can be discriminated.
2009,
2009,"He who rejects this view of the imperfection of the geological record,"
2009,will rightly reject the whole theory. For he may ask in vain where are
2009,the numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the
2009,"closely allied or representative species, found in the successive stages"
2009,of the same great formation? He may disbelieve in the immense intervals
2009,of time which must have elapsed between our consecutive formations;
2009,"he may overlook how important a part migration has played, when the"
2009,"formations of any one great region, as those of Europe, are considered;"
2009,"he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent, sudden coming in"
2009,of whole groups of species. He may ask where are the remains of those
2009,infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the
2009,Cambrian system was deposited? We now know that at least one animal did
2009,then exist; but I can answer this last question only by supposing that
2009,"where our oceans now extend they have extended for an enormous period,"
2009,and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood since the
2009,"commencement of the Cambrian system; but that, long before that epoch,"
2009,the world presented a widely different aspect; and that the older
2009,"continents, formed of formations older than any known to us, exist now"
2009,"only as remnants in a metamorphosed condition, or lie still buried under"
2009,the ocean.
2009,
2009,"Passing from these difficulties, the other great leading facts"
2009,in palaeontology agree admirably with the theory of descent with
2009,modification through variation and natural selection. We can thus
2009,understand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively;
2009,"how species of different classes do not necessarily change together, or"
2009,"at the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in the long run that all"
2009,undergo modification to some extent. The extinction of old forms is the
2009,almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms. We can
2009,"understand why, when a species has once disappeared, it never reappears."
2009,"Groups of species increase in numbers slowly, and endure for unequal"
2009,periods of time; for the process of modification is necessarily
2009,"slow, and depends on many complex contingencies. The dominant species"
2009,belonging to large and dominant groups tend to leave many modified
2009,"descendants, which form new sub-groups and groups. As these are"
2009,"formed, the species of the less vigorous groups, from their inferiority"
2009,"inherited from a common progenitor, tend to become extinct together, and"
2009,to leave no modified offspring on the face of the earth. But the
2009,utter extinction of a whole group of species has sometimes been a slow
2009,"process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected"
2009,"and isolated situations. When a group has once wholly disappeared, it"
2009,does not reappear; for the link of generation has been broken.
2009,
2009,We can understand how it is that dominant forms which spread widely and
2009,yield the greatest number of varieties tend to people the world with
2009,"allied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally succeed"
2009,in displacing the groups which are their inferiors in the struggle for
2009,"existence. Hence, after long intervals of time, the productions of the"
2009,world appear to have changed simultaneously.
2009,
2009,"We can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and"
2009,"recent, make together a few grand classes. We can understand, from the"
2009,"continued tendency to divergence of character, why the more ancient"
2009,"a form is, the more it generally differs from those now living. Why"
2009,ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing
2009,"forms, sometimes blending two groups, previously classed as distinct"
2009,into one; but more commonly bringing them only a little closer together.
2009,"The more ancient a form is, the more often it stands in some degree"
2009,intermediate between groups now distinct; for the more ancient a form
2009,"is, the more nearly it will be related to, and consequently resemble,"
2009,"the common progenitor of groups, since become widely divergent. Extinct"
2009,forms are seldom directly intermediate between existing forms; but are
2009,intermediate only by a long and circuitous course through other extinct
2009,and different forms. We can clearly see why the organic remains of
2009,closely consecutive formations are closely allied; for they are closely
2009,linked together by generation. We can clearly see why the remains of an
2009,intermediate formation are intermediate in character.
2009,
2009,The inhabitants of the world at each successive period in its history
2009,"have beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so"
2009,"far, higher in the scale, and their structure has generally become more"
2009,specialised; and this may account for the common belief held by so many
2009,"palaeontologists, that organisation on the whole has progressed. Extinct"
2009,and ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of the more
2009,"recent animals belonging to the same classes, and this wonderful fact"
2009,receives a simple explanation according to our views. The succession
2009,of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later
2009,"geological periods ceases to be mysterious, and is intelligible on the"
2009,principle of inheritance.
2009,
2009,"If, then, the geological record be as imperfect as many believe, and"
2009,it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much
2009,"more perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural selection are"
2009,"greatly diminished or disappear. On the other hand, all the chief laws"
2009,"of palaeontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species have"
2009,been produced by ordinary generation: old forms having been supplanted
2009,"by new and improved forms of life, the products of variation and the"
2009,survival of the fittest.

2009,
2009,
2009,CHAPTER XII. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.
2009,
2009, Present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical
2009, conditions--Importance of barriers--Affinity of the productions of the
2009, same continent--Centres of creation--Means of dispersal by changes of
2009," climate and of the level of the land, and by occasional means--Dispersal"
2009, during the Glacial period--Alternate Glacial periods in the North and
2009, South.
2009,
2009,
2009,In considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of
2009,"the globe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the"
2009,similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions
2009,can be wholly accounted for by climatal and other physical conditions.
2009,"Of late, almost every author who has studied the subject has come to"
2009,this conclusion. The case of America alone would almost suffice to prove
2009,"its truth; for if we exclude the arctic and northern temperate parts,"
2009,all authors agree that one of the most fundamental divisions in
2009,geographical distribution is that between the New and Old Worlds; yet
2009,"if we travel over the vast American continent, from the central parts of"
2009,"the United States to its extreme southern point, we meet with the most"
2009,"diversified conditions; humid districts, arid deserts, lofty mountains,"
2009,"grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes and great rivers, under almost"
2009,every temperature. There is hardly a climate or condition in the Old
2009,World which cannot be paralleled in the New--at least so closely as the
2009,same species generally require. No doubt small areas can be pointed out
2009,in the Old World hotter than any in the New World; but these are not
2009,inhabited by a fauna different from that of the surrounding districts;
2009,"for it is rare to find a group of organisms confined to a small area,"
2009,of which the conditions are peculiar in only a slight degree.
2009,Notwithstanding this general parallelism in the conditions of Old and
2009,"New Worlds, how widely different are their living productions!"
2009,
2009,"In the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land in"
2009,"Australia, South Africa, and western South America, between latitudes"
2009," and  degrees, we shall find parts extremely similar in all their"
2009,"conditions, yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas"
2009,"and floras more utterly dissimilar. Or, again, we may compare the"
2009,productions of South America south of latitude  degrees with those
2009,"north of  degrees, which consequently are separated by a space of"
2009,"ten degrees of latitude, and are exposed to considerably different"
2009,conditions; yet they are incomparably more closely related to each other
2009,than they are to the productions of Australia or Africa under nearly
2009,the same climate. Analogous facts could be given with respect to the
2009,inhabitants of the sea.
2009,
2009,"A second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, that"
2009,"barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a"
2009,close and important manner to the differences between the productions of
2009,various regions. We see this in the great difference in nearly all the
2009,"terrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds, excepting in the"
2009,"northern parts, where the land almost joins, and where, under a slightly"
2009,"different climate, there might have been free migration for the northern"
2009,"temperate forms, as there now is for the strictly arctic productions."
2009,We see the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of
2009,"Australia, Africa, and South America under the same latitude; for these"
2009,countries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible. On
2009,"each continent, also, we see the same fact; for on the opposite sides of"
2009,"lofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and of great deserts and even of"
2009,"large rivers, we find different productions; though as mountain chains,"
2009,"deserts, etc., are not as impassable, or likely to have endured so long,"
2009,"as the oceans separating continents, the differences are very inferior"
2009,in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents.
2009,
2009,"Turning to the sea, we find the same law. The marine inhabitants of"
2009,"the eastern and western shores of South America are very distinct, with"
2009,"extremely few shells, crustacea, or echinodermata in common; but Dr."
2009,Gunther has recently shown that about thirty per cent of the fishes are
2009,the same on the opposite sides of the isthmus of Panama; and this fact
2009,has led naturalists to believe that the isthmus was formerly open.
2009,"Westward of the shores of America, a wide space of open ocean extends,"
2009,with not an island as a halting-place for emigrants; here we have a
2009,"barrier of another kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet in the"
2009,eastern islands of the Pacific with another and totally distinct fauna.
2009,So that three marine faunas range northward and southward in parallel
2009,"lines not far from each other, under corresponding climate; but from"
2009,"being separated from each other by impassable barriers, either of"
2009,"land or open sea, they are almost wholly distinct. On the other hand,"
2009,proceeding still further westward from the eastern islands of the
2009,"tropical parts of the Pacific, we encounter no impassable barriers, and"
2009,"we have innumerable islands as halting-places, or continuous coasts,"
2009,"until, after travelling over a hemisphere, we come to the shores of"
2009,Africa; and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined and
2009,distinct marine faunas. Although so few marine animals are common to the
2009,above-named three approximate faunas of Eastern and Western America and
2009,"the eastern Pacific islands, yet many fishes range from the Pacific into"
2009,"the Indian Ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern islands of"
2009,the Pacific and the eastern shores of Africa on almost exactly opposite
2009,meridians of longitude.
2009,
2009,"A third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statement, is the"
2009,"affinity of the productions of the same continent or of the same sea,"
2009,though the species themselves are distinct at different points and
2009,"stations. It is a law of the widest generality, and every continent"
2009,"offers innumerable instances. Nevertheless, the naturalist, in"
2009,"travelling, for instance, from north to south, never fails to be"
2009,"struck by the manner in which successive groups of beings, specifically"
2009,"distinct, though nearly related, replace each other. He hears from"
2009,"closely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes nearly similar, and"
2009,"sees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite alike, with eggs"
2009,coloured in nearly the same manner. The plains near the Straits of
2009,"Magellan are inhabited by one species of Rhea (American ostrich), and"
2009,northward the plains of La Plata by another species of the same genus;
2009,"and not by a true ostrich or emu, like those inhabiting Africa and"
2009,Australia under the same latitude. On these same plains of La Plata we
2009,"see the agouti and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as"
2009,"our hares and rabbits, and belonging to the same order of Rodents, but"
2009,they plainly display an American type of structure. We ascend the lofty
2009,"peaks of the Cordillera, and we find an alpine species of bizcacha; we"
2009,"look to the waters, and we do not find the beaver or muskrat, but the"
2009,"coypu and capybara, rodents of the South American type. Innumerable"
2009,other instances could be given. If we look to the islands off the
2009,"American shore, however much they may differ in geological structure,"
2009,"the inhabitants are essentially American, though they may be all"
2009,"peculiar species. We may look back to past ages, as shown in the last"
2009,"chapter, and we find American types then prevailing on the American"
2009,continent and in the American seas. We see in these facts some deep
2009,"organic bond, throughout space and time, over the same areas of land and"
2009,"water, independently of physical conditions. The naturalist must be dull"
2009,who is not led to inquire what this bond is.
2009,
2009,"The bond is simply inheritance, that cause which alone, as far as we"
2009,"positively know, produces organisms quite like each other, or, as we"
2009,"see in the case of varieties, nearly alike. The dissimilarity of the"
2009,inhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification
2009,"through variation and natural selection, and probably in a subordinate"
2009,degree to the definite influence of different physical conditions.
2009,The degrees of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more
2009,dominant forms of life from one region into another having been more
2009,"or less effectually prevented, at periods more or less remote--on the"
2009,nature and number of the former immigrants--and on the action of the
2009,inhabitants on each other in leading to the preservation of different
2009,modifications; the relation of organism to organism in the struggle for
2009,"life being, as I have already often remarked, the most important of"
2009,all relations. Thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by
2009,checking migration; as does time for the slow process of modification
2009,"through natural selection. Widely-ranging species, abounding in"
2009,"individuals, which have already triumphed over many competitors in their"
2009,"own widely-extended homes, will have the best chance of seizing on new"
2009,"places, when they spread out into new countries. In their new homes they"
2009,"will be exposed to new conditions, and will frequently undergo further"
2009,modification and improvement; and thus they will become still further
2009,"victorious, and will produce groups of modified descendants. On this"
2009,principle of inheritance with modification we can understand how it is
2009,"that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families, are confined"
2009,"to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case."
2009,
2009,"There is no evidence, as was remarked in the last chapter, of the"
2009,existence of any law of necessary development. As the variability of
2009,"each species is an independent property, and will be taken advantage of"
2009,"by natural selection, only so far as it profits each individual in its"
2009,"complex struggle for life, so the amount of modification in different"
2009,"species will be no uniform quantity. If a number of species, after"
2009,"having long competed with each other in their old home, were to migrate"
2009,"in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country, they would be"
2009,little liable to modification; for neither migration nor isolation in
2009,themselves effect anything. These principles come into play only by
2009,bringing organisms into new relations with each other and in a lesser
2009,degree with the surrounding physical conditions. As we have seen in the
2009,last chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character
2009,"from an enormously remote geological period, so certain species have"
2009,"migrated over vast spaces, and have not become greatly or at all"
2009,modified.
2009,
2009,"According to these views, it is obvious that the several species of the"
2009,"same genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world,"
2009,"must originally have proceeded from the same source, as they are"
2009,descended from the same progenitor. In the case of those species which
2009,"have undergone, during whole geological periods, little modification,"
2009,there is not much difficulty in believing that they have migrated from
2009,the same region; for during the vast geographical and climatical
2009,"changes which have supervened since ancient times, almost any amount of"
2009,"migration is possible. But in many other cases, in which we have"
2009,reason to believe that the species of a genus have been produced within
2009,"comparatively recent times, there is great difficulty on this head. It"
2009,"is also obvious that the individuals of the same species, though now"
2009,"inhabiting distant and isolated regions, must have proceeded from"
2009,"one spot, where their parents were first produced: for, as has been"
2009,"explained, it is incredible that individuals identically the same should"
2009,have been produced from parents specifically distinct.
2009,
2009,SINGLE CENTRES OF SUPPOSED CREATION.
2009,
2009,We are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by
2009,"naturalists, namely, whether species have been created at one or more"
2009,points of the earth's surface. Undoubtedly there are many cases of
2009,extreme difficulty in understanding how the same species could possibly
2009,have migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated
2009,"points, where now found. Nevertheless the simplicity of the view that"
2009,each species was first produced within a single region captivates the
2009,"mind. He who rejects it, rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation"
2009,"with subsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. It is"
2009,"universally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a species"
2009,is continuous; and that when a plant or animal inhabits two points so
2009,"distant from each other, or with an interval of such a nature, that the"
2009,"space could not have been easily passed over by migration, the fact"
2009,is given as something remarkable and exceptional. The incapacity of
2009,migrating across a wide sea is more clear in the case of terrestrial
2009,"mammals than perhaps with any other organic beings; and, accordingly,"
2009,we find no inexplicable instances of the same mammals inhabiting distant
2009,points of the world. No geologist feels any difficulty in Great Britain
2009,"possessing the same quadrupeds with the rest of Europe, for they were"
2009,no doubt once united. But if the same species can be produced at two
2009,"separate points, why do we not find a single mammal common to Europe and"
2009,Australia or South America? The conditions of life are nearly the
2009,"same, so that a multitude of European animals and plants have become"
2009,naturalised in America and Australia; and some of the aboriginal plants
2009,are identically the same at these distant points of the northern and
2009,"southern hemispheres? The answer, as I believe, is, that mammals have"
2009,"not been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from their varied means"
2009,"of dispersal, have migrated across the wide and broken interspaces. The"
2009,"great and striking influence of barriers of all kinds, is intelligible"
2009,only on the view that the great majority of species have been produced
2009,"on one side, and have not been able to migrate to the opposite side."
2009,"Some few families, many subfamilies, very many genera, a still greater"
2009,"number of sections of genera, are confined to a single region; and it"
2009,"has been observed by several naturalists that the most natural genera,"
2009,or those genera in which the species are most closely related to each
2009,"other, are generally confined to the same country, or if they have a"
2009,wide range that their range is continuous. What a strange anomaly it
2009,would be if a directly opposite rule were to prevail when we go down one
2009,"step lower in the series, namely to the individuals of the same species,"
2009,"and these had not been, at least at first, confined to some one region!"
2009,
2009,"Hence, it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the"
2009,"view of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having"
2009,subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration
2009,"and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most"
2009,probable. Undoubtedly many cases occur in which we cannot explain how
2009,the same species could have passed from one point to the other. But the
2009,geographical and climatical changes which have certainly occurred within
2009,"recent geological times, must have rendered discontinuous the formerly"
2009,continuous range of many species. So that we are reduced to consider
2009,"whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous, and of so"
2009,"grave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered probable"
2009,"by general considerations, that each species has been produced within"
2009,"one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could. It would be"
2009,hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same
2009,"species, now living at distant and separated points; nor do I for a"
2009,moment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many instances.
2009,"But, after some preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most"
2009,"striking classes of facts, namely, the existence of the same species"
2009,"on the summits of distant mountain ranges, and at distant points in the"
2009,"Arctic and Antarctic regions; and secondly (in the following chapter),"
2009,"the wide distribution of fresh water productions; and thirdly, the"
2009,occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the nearest
2009,"mainland, though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea. If the"
2009,existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the
2009,earth's surface can in many instances be explained on the view of each
2009,"species having migrated from a single birthplace; then, considering our"
2009,"ignorance with respect to former climatical and geographical changes,"
2009,"and to the various occasional means of transport, the belief that a"
2009,single birthplace is the law seems to me incomparably the safest.
2009,
2009,In discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time to
2009,"consider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several"
2009,species of a genus which must on our theory all be descended from a
2009,"common progenitor, can have migrated, undergoing modification during"
2009,"their migration from some one area. If, when most of the species"
2009,"inhabiting one region are different from those of another region, though"
2009,"closely allied to them, it can be shown that migration from the one"
2009,"region to the other has probably occurred at some former period, our"
2009,general view will be much strengthened; for the explanation is obvious
2009,"on the principle of descent with modification. A volcanic island, for"
2009,"instance, upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles"
2009,"from a continent, would probably receive from it in the course of time"
2009,"a few colonists, and their descendants, though modified, would still be"
2009,related by inheritance to the inhabitants of that continent. Cases of
2009,"this nature are common, and are, as we shall hereafter see, inexplicable"
2009,on the theory of independent creation. This view of the relation of the
2009,"species of one region to those of another, does not differ much from"
2009,"that advanced by Mr. Wallace, who concludes that ""every species has come"
2009,into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing
2009,"closely allied species."" And it is now well known that he attributes"
2009,this coincidence to descent with modification.
2009,
2009,The question of single or multiple centres of creation differs from
2009,"another though allied question, namely, whether all the individuals"
2009,"of the same species are descended from a single pair, or single"
2009,"hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many"
2009,individuals simultaneously created. With organic beings which never
2009,"intercross, if such exist, each species, must be descended from a"
2009,"succession of modified varieties, that have supplanted each other,"
2009,but have never blended with other individuals or varieties of the same
2009,"species, so that, at each successive stage of modification, all the"
2009,individuals of the same form will be descended from a single parent.
2009,"But in the great majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which"
2009,"habitually unite for each birth, or which occasionally intercross, the"
2009,individuals of the same species inhabiting the same area will be kept
2009,nearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals will go on
2009,"simultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification at each"
2009,stage will not be due to descent from a single parent. To illustrate
2009,what I mean: our English race-horses differ from the horses of every
2009,other breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority to
2009,"descent from any single pair, but to continued care in the selecting and"
2009,training of many individuals during each generation.
2009,
2009,"Before discussing the three classes of facts, which I have selected as"
2009,"presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of ""single"
2009,"centres of creation,"" I must say a few words on the means of dispersal."
2009,
2009,MEANS OF DISPERSAL.
2009,
2009,Sir C. Lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject. I can
2009,give here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts. Change
2009,of climate must have had a powerful influence on migration. A region now
2009,"impassable to certain organisms from the nature of its climate, might"
2009,"have been a high road for migration, when the climate was different. I"
2009,"shall, however, presently have to discuss this branch of the subject"
2009,in some detail. Changes of level in the land must also have been highly
2009,influential: a narrow isthmus now separates two marine faunas; submerge
2009,"it, or let it formerly have been submerged, and the two faunas will now"
2009,"blend together, or may formerly have blended. Where the sea now extends,"
2009,land may at a former period have connected islands or possibly even
2009,"continents together, and thus have allowed terrestrial productions to"
2009,pass from one to the other. No geologist disputes that great mutations
2009,of level have occurred within the period of existing organisms. Edward
2009,Forbes insisted that all the islands in the Atlantic must have been
2009,"recently connected with Europe or Africa, and Europe likewise with"
2009,America. Other authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every
2009,"ocean, and united almost every island with some mainland. If, indeed,"
2009,"the arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted, it must be admitted that"
2009,scarcely a single island exists which has not recently been united to
2009,some continent. This view cuts the Gordian knot of the dispersal of the
2009,"same species to the most distant points, and removes many a difficulty;"
2009,but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in admitting such
2009,enormous geographical changes within the period of existing species. It
2009,seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great oscillations in the
2009,level of the land or sea; but not of such vast changes in the position
2009,"and extension of our continents, as to have united them within the"
2009,recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic
2009,"islands. I freely admit the former existence of many islands, now buried"
2009,"beneath the sea, which may have served as halting places for plants and"
2009,for many animals during their migration. In the coral-producing oceans
2009,such sunken islands are now marked by rings of coral or atolls standing
2009,"over them. Whenever it is fully admitted, as it will some day be, that"
2009,"each species has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in"
2009,the course of time we know something definite about the means of
2009,"distribution, we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the"
2009,former extension of the land. But I do not believe that it will ever be
2009,proved that within the recent period most of our continents which now
2009,"stand quite separate, have been continuously, or almost continuously"
2009,"united with each other, and with the many existing oceanic islands."
2009,Several facts in distribution--such as the great difference in the
2009,marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every continent--the close
2009,relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to
2009,their present inhabitants--the degree of affinity between the mammals
2009,"inhabiting islands with those of the nearest continent, being in part"
2009,determined (as we shall hereafter see) by the depth of the intervening
2009,ocean--these and other such facts are opposed to the admission of such
2009,"prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent period, as are"
2009,necessary on the view advanced by Forbes and admitted by his followers.
2009,The nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic
2009,islands are likewise opposed to the belief of their former continuity of
2009,continents. Nor does the almost universally volcanic composition of
2009,such islands favour the admission that they are the wrecks of sunken
2009,continents; if they had originally existed as continental mountain
2009,"ranges, some at least of the islands would have been formed, like other"
2009,"mountain summits, of granite, metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous and"
2009,"other rocks, instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter."
2009,
2009,"I must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but"
2009,which more properly should be called occasional means of distribution.
2009,"I shall here confine myself to plants. In botanical works, this or that"
2009,plant is often stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but the
2009,greater or less facilities for transport across the sea may be said to
2009,"be almost wholly unknown. Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley's aid, a"
2009,"few experiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist"
2009,the injurious action of sea-water. To my surprise I found that out
2009,"of eighty-seven kinds, sixty-four germinated after an immersion of"
2009,"twenty-eight days, and a few survived an immersion of  days. It"
2009,deserves notice that certain orders were far more injured than others:
2009,"nine Leguminosae were tried, and, with one exception, they resisted the"
2009,"salt-water badly; seven species of the allied orders, Hydrophyllaceae"
2009,"and Polemoniaceae, were all killed by a month's immersion. For"
2009,convenience sake I chiefly tried small seeds without the capsules or
2009,"fruit; and as all of these sank in a few days, they could not have been"
2009,"floated across wide spaces of the sea, whether or not they were injured"
2009,"by salt water. Afterwards I tried some larger fruits, capsules, etc.,"
2009,and some of these floated for a long time. It is well known what a
2009,difference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber; and it
2009,occurred to me that floods would often wash into the sea dried plants or
2009,branches with seed-capsules or fruit attached to them. Hence I was led
2009,"to dry the stems and branches of ninety-four plants with ripe fruit, and"
2009,"to place them on sea-water. The majority sank quickly, but some which,"
2009,"whilst green, floated for a very short time, when dried floated much"
2009,"longer; for instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried"
2009,"they floated for ninety days, and afterwards when planted germinated;"
2009,"an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for twenty-three days,"
2009,"when dried it floated for eighty-five days, and the seeds afterwards"
2009,"germinated: the ripe seeds of Helosciadium sank in two days, when"
2009,"dried they floated for above ninety days, and afterwards germinated."
2009,"Altogether, out of the ninety-four dried plants, eighteen floated for"
2009,above twenty-eight days; and some of the eighteen floated for a very
2009,much longer period. So that as / kinds of seeds germinated after an
2009,immersion of twenty-eight days; and as / distinct species with ripe
2009,fruit (but not all the same species as in the foregoing experiment)
2009,"floated, after being dried, for above twenty-eight days, we may"
2009,"conclude, as far as anything can be inferred from these scanty facts,"
2009,that the seeds of / kinds of plants of any country might be floated
2009,"by sea-currents during twenty-eight days, and would retain their power"
2009,"of germination. In Johnston's Physical Atlas, the average rate of the"
2009,several Atlantic currents is thirty-three miles per diem (some currents
2009,"running at the rate of sixty miles per diem); on this average, the seeds"
2009,of / plants belonging to one country might be floated across 
2009,"miles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if blown by an"
2009,"inland gale to a favourable spot, would germinate."
2009,
2009,"Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, but in a"
2009,"much better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea,"
2009,so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really
2009,"floating plants. He tried ninety-eight seeds, mostly different from"
2009,"mine, but he chose many large fruits, and likewise seeds, from plants"
2009,which live near the sea; and this would have favoured both the average
2009,length of their flotation and their resistance to the injurious action
2009,"of the salt-water. On the other hand, he did not previously dry the"
2009,"plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have"
2009,caused some of them to have floated much longer. The result was that
2009,"/ of his seeds of different kinds floated for forty-two days, and"
2009,were then capable of germination. But I do not doubt that plants exposed
2009,to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from
2009,"violent movement as in our experiments. Therefore, it would perhaps be"
2009,"safer to assume that the seeds of about / plants of a flora, after"
2009,"having been dried, could be floated across a space of sea  miles in"
2009,"width, and would then germinate. The fact of the larger fruits often"
2009,"floating longer than the small, is interesting; as plants with large"
2009,"seeds or fruit which, as Alph. de Candolle has shown, generally have"
2009,"restricted ranges, could hardly be transported by any other means."
2009,
2009,Seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. Drift timber
2009,"is thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the widest"
2009,oceans; and the natives of the coral islands in the Pacific procure
2009,"stones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these"
2009,stones being a valuable royal tax. I find that when irregularly shaped
2009,"stones are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels of earth"
2009,"are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind them, so"
2009,perfectly that not a particle could be washed away during the longest
2009,transport: out of one small portion of earth thus COMPLETELY enclosed by
2009,"the roots of an oak about fifty years old, three dicotyledonous plants"
2009,"germinated: I am certain of the accuracy of this observation. Again,"
2009,"I can show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea,"
2009,sometimes escape being immediately devoured; and many kinds of seeds
2009,in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas and
2009,"vetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days' immersion in"
2009,"sea-water; but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had floated"
2009,"on artificial sea-water for thirty days, to my surprise nearly all"
2009,germinated.
2009,
2009,Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the
2009,transportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how frequently
2009,birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the
2009,ocean. We may safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of
2009,flight would often be thirty-five miles an hour; and some authors have
2009,given a far higher estimate. I have never seen an instance of nutritious
2009,seeds passing through the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit
2009,pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey. In the
2009,"course of two months, I picked up in my garden twelve kinds of seeds,"
2009,"out of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed perfect, and some"
2009,"of them, which were tried, germinated. But the following fact is more"
2009,"important: the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not,"
2009,"as I know by trial, injure in the least the germination of seeds;"
2009,"now, after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food, it is"
2009,positively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for
2009,twelve or even eighteen hours. A bird in this interval might easily be
2009,"blown to the distance of five hundred miles, and hawks are known to look"
2009,"out for tired birds, and the contents of their torn crops might thus"
2009,"readily get scattered. Some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole, and"
2009,"after an interval of from twelve to twenty hours, disgorge pellets,"
2009,"which, as I know from experiments made in the Zoological Gardens,"
2009,"include seeds capable of germination. Some seeds of the oat, wheat,"
2009,"millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after having been from"
2009,twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey;
2009,and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two days
2009,"and fourteen hours. Fresh-water fish, I find, eat seeds of many land and"
2009,"water plants; fish are frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds"
2009,might be transported from place to place. I forced many kinds of
2009,"seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to"
2009,"fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds, after an interval of"
2009,"many hours, either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their"
2009,excrement; and several of these seeds retained the power of germination.
2009,"Certain seeds, however, were always killed by this process."
2009,
2009,Locusts are sometimes blown to great distances from the land. I myself
2009,"caught one  miles from the coast of Africa, and have heard of others"
2009,caught at greater distances. The Rev. R.T. Lowe informed Sir C. Lyell
2009,"that in November, , swarms of locusts visited the island of Madeira."
2009,"They were in countless numbers, as thick as the flakes of snow in the"
2009,"heaviest snowstorm, and extended upward as far as could be seen with a"
2009,telescope. During two or three days they slowly careered round and round
2009,"in an immense ellipse, at least five or six miles in diameter, and at"
2009,"night alighted on the taller trees, which were completely coated with"
2009,"them. They then disappeared over the sea, as suddenly as they had"
2009,"appeared, and have not since visited the island. Now, in parts of Natal"
2009,"it is believed by some farmers, though on insufficient evidence, that"
2009,injurious seeds are introduced into their grass-land in the dung left
2009,by the great flights of locusts which often visit that country. In
2009,consequence of this belief Mr. Weale sent me in a letter a small packet
2009,"of the dried pellets, out of which I extracted under the microscope"
2009,"several seeds, and raised from them seven grass plants, belonging to"
2009,"two species, of two genera. Hence a swarm of locusts, such as that which"
2009,"visited Madeira, might readily be the means of introducing several kinds"
2009,of plants into an island lying far from the mainland.
2009,
2009,"Although the beaks and feet of birds are generally clean, earth"
2009,"sometimes adheres to them: in one case I removed sixty-one grains, and"
2009,in another case twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from the
2009,"foot of a partridge, and in the earth there was a pebble as large as the"
2009,seed of a vetch. Here is a better case: the leg of a woodcock was sent
2009,"to me by a friend, with a little cake of dry earth attached to the"
2009,"shank, weighing only nine grains; and this contained a seed of"
2009,the toad-rush (Juncus bufonius) which germinated and flowered. Mr.
2009,"Swaysland, of Brighton, who during the last forty years has paid close"
2009,"attention to our migratory birds, informs me that he has often shot"
2009,"wagtails (Motacillae), wheatears, and whinchats (Saxicolae), on their"
2009,"first arrival on our shores, before they had alighted; and he has"
2009,several times noticed little cakes of earth attached to their feet. Many
2009,facts could be given showing how generally soil is charged with seeds.
2009,"For instance, Professor Newton sent me the leg of a red-legged partridge"
2009,"(Caccabis rufa) which had been wounded and could not fly, with a ball of"
2009,"hard earth adhering to it, and weighing six and a half ounces. The earth"
2009,"had been kept for three years, but when broken, watered and placed"
2009,"under a bell glass, no less than eighty-two plants sprung from it: these"
2009,"consisted of twelve monocotyledons, including the common oat, and at"
2009,"least one kind of grass, and of seventy dicotyledons, which consisted,"
2009,"judging from the young leaves, of at least three distinct species."
2009,"With such facts before us, can we doubt that the many birds which are"
2009,"annually blown by gales across great spaces of ocean, and which"
2009,"annually migrate--for instance, the millions of quails across the"
2009,Mediterranean--must occasionally transport a few seeds embedded in
2009,dirt adhering to their feet or beaks? But I shall have to recur to this
2009,subject.
2009,
2009,"As icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and"
2009,"have even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, it can"
2009,"hardly be doubted that they must occasionally, as suggested by Lyell,"
2009,have transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and
2009,antarctic regions; and during the Glacial period from one part of the
2009,"now temperate regions to another. In the Azores, from the large number"
2009,"of plants common to Europe, in comparison with the species on the other"
2009,"islands of the Atlantic, which stand nearer to the mainland, and (as"
2009,"remarked by Mr. H.C. Watson) from their somewhat northern character, in"
2009,"comparison with the latitude, I suspected that these islands had been"
2009,partly stocked by ice-borne seeds during the Glacial epoch. At my
2009,request Sir C. Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to inquire whether he had
2009,"observed erratic boulders on these islands, and he answered that he had"
2009,"found large fragments of granite and other rocks, which do not occur in"
2009,the archipelago. Hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed
2009,"their rocky burdens on the shores of these mid-ocean islands, and it"
2009,is at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds of
2009,northern plants.
2009,
2009,"Considering that these several means of transport, and that other means,"
2009,"which without doubt remain to be discovered, have been in action year"
2009,"after year for tens of thousands of years, it would, I think, be a"
2009,marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported.
2009,"These means of transport are sometimes called accidental, but this is"
2009,"not strictly correct: the currents of the sea are not accidental, nor"
2009,is the direction of prevalent gales of wind. It should be observed
2009,that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great
2009,distances; for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a
2009,great length of time to the action of sea water; nor could they be long
2009,"carried in the crops or intestines of birds. These means, however, would"
2009,suffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred
2009,"miles in breadth, or from island to island, or from a continent to a"
2009,"neighbouring island, but not from one distant continent to another. The"
2009,floras of distant continents would not by such means become mingled;
2009,"but would remain as distinct as they now are. The currents, from their"
2009,"course, would never bring seeds from North America to Britain, though"
2009,they might and do bring seeds from the West Indies to our western
2009,"shores, where, if not killed by their very long immersion in salt"
2009,"water, they could not endure our climate. Almost every year, one or two"
2009,"land-birds are blown across the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North"
2009,America to the western shores of Ireland and England; but seeds could be
2009,"transported by these rare wanderers only by one means, namely, by dirt"
2009,"adhering to their feet or beaks, which is in itself a rare accident."
2009,"Even in this case, how small would be the chance of a seed falling on"
2009,"favourable soil, and coming to maturity! But it would be a great error"
2009,"to argue that because a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has"
2009,"not, as far as is known (and it would be very difficult to prove this),"
2009,"received within the last few centuries, through occasional means"
2009,"of transport, immigrants from Europe or any other continent, that a"
2009,"poorly-stocked island, though standing more remote from the mainland,"
2009,would not receive colonists by similar means. Out of a hundred kinds of
2009,"seeds or animals transported to an island, even if far less well-stocked"
2009,"than Britain, perhaps not more than one would be so well fitted to"
2009,"its new home, as to become naturalised. But this is no valid argument"
2009,"against what would be effected by occasional means of transport, during"
2009,"the long lapse of geological time, whilst the island was being upheaved,"
2009,and before it had become fully stocked with inhabitants. On almost bare
2009,"land, with few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly"
2009,"every seed which chanced to arrive, if fitted for the climate, would"
2009,germinate and survive.
2009,
2009,DISPERSAL DURING THE GLACIAL PERIOD.
2009,
2009,"The identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits, separated"
2009,"from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where Alpine species"
2009,"could not possibly exist, is one of the most striking cases known of the"
2009,"same species living at distant points, without the apparent possibility"
2009,of their having migrated from one point to the other. It is indeed a
2009,remarkable fact to see so many plants of the same species living on the
2009,"snowy regions of the Alps or Pyrenees, and in the extreme northern parts"
2009,"of Europe; but it is far more remarkable, that the plants on the White"
2009,"Mountains, in the United States of America, are all the same with those"
2009,"of Labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa Gray, with"
2009,"those on the loftiest mountains of Europe. Even as long ago as ,"
2009,such facts led Gmelin to conclude that the same species must have
2009,been independently created at many distinct points; and we might have
2009,"remained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others called vivid"
2009,"attention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall immediately see,"
2009,affords a simple explanation of these facts. We have evidence of almost
2009,"every conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that, within a very"
2009,"recent geological period, central Europe and North America suffered"
2009,under an Arctic climate. The ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell
2009,"their tale more plainly than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales,"
2009,"with their scored flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of"
2009,the icy streams with which their valleys were lately filled. So greatly
2009,"has the climate of Europe changed, that in Northern Italy, gigantic"
2009,"moraines, left by old glaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize."
2009,"Throughout a large part of the United States, erratic boulders and"
2009,scored rocks plainly reveal a former cold period.
2009,
2009,The former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the
2009,"inhabitants of Europe, as explained by Edward Forbes, is substantially"
2009,"as follows. But we shall follow the changes more readily, by supposing"
2009,"a new glacial period slowly to come on, and then pass away, as formerly"
2009,"occurred. As the cold came on, and as each more southern zone became"
2009,"fitted for the inhabitants of the north, these would take the places of"
2009,"the former inhabitants of the temperate regions. The latter, at the"
2009,"same time would travel further and further southward, unless they were"
2009,"stopped by barriers, in which case they would perish. The mountains"
2009,"would become covered with snow and ice, and their former Alpine"
2009,inhabitants would descend to the plains. By the time that the cold had
2009,"reached its maximum, we should have an arctic fauna and flora, covering"
2009,"the central parts of Europe, as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees,"
2009,and even stretching into Spain. The now temperate regions of the United
2009,States would likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals and
2009,these would be nearly the same with those of Europe; for the present
2009,"circumpolar inhabitants, which we suppose to have everywhere travelled"
2009,"southward, are remarkably uniform round the world."
2009,
2009,"As the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward,"
2009,closely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more
2009,temperate regions. And as the snow melted from the bases of the
2009,"mountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed"
2009,"ground, always ascending, as the warmth increased and the snow still"
2009,"further disappeared, higher and higher, whilst their brethren were"
2009,"pursuing their northern journey. Hence, when the warmth had fully"
2009,"returned, the same species, which had lately lived together on the"
2009,"European and North American lowlands, would again be found in the arctic"
2009,"regions of the Old and New Worlds, and on many isolated mountain-summits"
2009,far distant from each other.
2009,
2009,Thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so
2009,immensely remote as the mountains of the United States and those of
2009,Europe. We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine plants
2009,of each mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms
2009,living due north or nearly due north of them: for the first migration
2009,"when the cold came on, and the re-migration on the returning warmth,"
2009,"would generally have been due south and north. The Alpine plants, for"
2009,"example, of Scotland, as remarked by Mr. H.C. Watson, and those of"
2009,"the Pyrenees, as remarked by Ramond, are more especially allied to the"
2009,plants of northern Scandinavia; those of the United States to Labrador;
2009,those of the mountains of Siberia to the arctic regions of that country.
2009,"These views, grounded as they are on the perfectly well-ascertained"
2009,"occurrence of a former Glacial period, seem to me to explain in so"
2009,satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the Alpine and Arctic
2009,"productions of Europe and America, that when in other regions we find"
2009,"the same species on distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude,"
2009,"without other evidence, that a colder climate formerly permitted their"
2009,"migration across the intervening lowlands, now become too warm for their"
2009,existence.
2009,
2009,As the arctic forms moved first southward and afterwards backward to
2009,"the north, in unison with the changing climate, they will not have"
2009,been exposed during their long migrations to any great diversity of
2009,"temperature; and as they all migrated in a body together, their mutual"
2009,"relations will not have been much disturbed. Hence, in accordance with"
2009,"the principles inculcated in this volume, these forms will not have"
2009,"been liable to much modification. But with the Alpine productions, left"
2009,"isolated from the moment of the returning warmth, first at the bases"
2009,"and ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the case will have"
2009,been somewhat different; for it is not likely that all the same arctic
2009,species will have been left on mountain ranges far distant from each
2009,"other, and have survived there ever since; they will also, in all"
2009,"probability, have become mingled with ancient Alpine species, which must"
2009,have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the Glacial
2009,"epoch, and which during the coldest period will have been temporarily"
2009,"driven down to the plains; they will, also, have been subsequently"
2009,exposed to somewhat different climatical influences. Their mutual
2009,relations will thus have been in some degree disturbed; consequently
2009,they will have been liable to modification; and they have been modified;
2009,for if we compare the present Alpine plants and animals of the several
2009,"great European mountain ranges, one with another, though many of the"
2009,"species remain identically the same, some exist as varieties, some as"
2009,doubtful forms or sub-species and some as distinct yet closely allied
2009,species representing each other on the several ranges.
2009,
2009,"In the foregoing illustration, I have assumed that at the commencement"
2009,"of our imaginary Glacial period, the arctic productions were as uniform"
2009,round the polar regions as they are at the present day. But it is also
2009,necessary to assume that many sub-arctic and some few temperate forms
2009,"were the same round the world, for some of the species which now exist"
2009,on the lower mountain slopes and on the plains of North America and
2009,Europe are the same; and it may be asked how I account for this degree
2009,"of uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate forms round the world,"
2009,"at the commencement of the real Glacial period. At the present day, the"
2009,sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds
2009,are separated from each other by the whole Atlantic Ocean and by the
2009,"northern part of the Pacific. During the Glacial period, when the"
2009,inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than they
2009,"do at present, they must have been still more completely separated from"
2009,each other by wider spaces of ocean; so that it may well be asked
2009,how the same species could then or previously have entered the two
2009,"continents. The explanation, I believe, lies in the nature of the"
2009,"climate before the commencement of the Glacial period. At this, the"
2009,"newer Pliocene period, the majority of the inhabitants of the world were"
2009,"specifically the same as now, and we have good reason to believe that"
2009,"the climate was warmer than at the present day. Hence, we may suppose"
2009,"that the organisms which now live under latitude  degrees, lived"
2009,"during the Pliocene period further north, under the Polar Circle, in"
2009,latitude - degrees; and that the present arctic productions then
2009,"lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole. Now, if we look at"
2009,"a terrestrial globe, we see under the Polar Circle that there is almost"
2009,"continuous land from western Europe through Siberia, to eastern America."
2009,"And this continuity of the circumpolar land, with the consequent freedom"
2009,"under a more favourable climate for intermigration, will account for the"
2009,supposed uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate productions of the
2009,"Old and New Worlds, at a period anterior to the Glacial epoch."
2009,
2009,"Believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have long"
2009,"remained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected to great"
2009,"oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to extend the above view,"
2009,"and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period, such as"
2009,"the older Pliocene period, a large number of the same plants and animals"
2009,inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land; and that these plants
2009,"and animals, both in the Old and New Worlds, began slowly to migrate"
2009,"southwards as the climate became less warm, long before the commencement"
2009,"of the Glacial period. We now see, as I believe, their descendants,"
2009,"mostly in a modified condition, in the central parts of Europe and the"
2009,United States. On this view we can understand the relationship with very
2009,"little identity, between the productions of North America and Europe--a"
2009,"relationship which is highly remarkable, considering the distance of"
2009,"the two areas, and their separation by the whole Atlantic Ocean. We can"
2009,further understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers
2009,that the productions of Europe and America during the later tertiary
2009,stages were more closely related to each other than they are at the
2009,present time; for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the
2009,Old and New Worlds will have been almost continuously united by
2009,"land, serving as a bridge, since rendered impassable by cold, for the"
2009,intermigration of their inhabitants.
2009,
2009,"During the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon as"
2009,"the species in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds, migrated"
2009,"south of the Polar Circle, they will have been completely cut off from"
2009,"each other. This separation, as far as the more temperate productions"
2009,"are concerned, must have taken place long ages ago. As the plants and"
2009,"animals migrated southward, they will have become mingled in the one"
2009,"great region with the native American productions, and would have had to"
2009,"compete with them; and in the other great region, with those of the"
2009,Old World. Consequently we have here everything favourable for
2009,much modification--for far more modification than with the Alpine
2009,"productions, left isolated, within a much more recent period, on the"
2009,several mountain ranges and on the arctic lands of Europe and North
2009,"America. Hence, it has come, that when we compare the now living"
2009,"productions of the temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find"
2009,very few identical species (though Asa Gray has lately shown that more
2009,"plants are identical than was formerly supposed), but we find in every"
2009,"great class many forms, which some naturalists rank as geographical"
2009,"races, and others as distinct species; and a host of closely allied or"
2009,representative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically
2009,distinct.
2009,
2009,"As on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration"
2009,"of a marine fauna, which, during the Pliocene or even a somewhat earlier"
2009,"period, was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the Polar"
2009,"Circle, will account, on the theory of modification, for many closely"
2009,"allied forms now living in marine areas completely sundered. Thus, I"
2009,"think, we can understand the presence of some closely allied, still"
2009,"existing and extinct tertiary forms, on the eastern and western shores"
2009,of temperate North America; and the still more striking fact of many
2009,"closely allied crustaceans (as described in Dana's admirable work), some"
2009,"fish and other marine animals, inhabiting the Mediterranean and the seas"
2009,of Japan--these two areas being now completely separated by the breadth
2009,of a whole continent and by wide spaces of ocean.
2009,
2009,These cases of close relationship in species either now or formerly
2009,"inhabiting the seas on the eastern and western shores of North America,"
2009,"the Mediterranean and Japan, and the temperate lands of North America"
2009,"and Europe, are inexplicable on the theory of creation. We cannot"
2009,"maintain that such species have been created alike, in correspondence"
2009,with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas; for if we
2009,"compare, for instance, certain parts of South America with parts of"
2009,"South Africa or Australia, we see countries closely similar in all their"
2009,"physical conditions, with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar."
2009,
2009,ALTERNATE GLACIAL PERIODS IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH.
2009,
2009,But we must return to our more immediate subject. I am convinced that
2009,Forbes's view may be largely extended. In Europe we meet with the
2009,"plainest evidence of the Glacial period, from the western shores of"
2009,"Britain to the Ural range, and southward to the Pyrenees. We may infer"
2009,"from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation, that"
2009,"Siberia was similarly affected. In the Lebanon, according to Dr. Hooker,"
2009,"perpetual snow formerly covered the central axis, and fed glaciers which"
2009,"rolled , feet down the valleys. The same observer has recently found"
2009,great moraines at a low level on the Atlas range in North Africa. Along
2009,"the Himalaya, at points  miles apart, glaciers have left the marks of"
2009,"their former low descent; and in Sikkim, Dr. Hooker saw maize growing"
2009,"on ancient and gigantic moraines. Southward of the Asiatic continent, on"
2009,"the opposite side of the equator, we know, from the excellent researches"
2009,"of Dr. J. Haast and Dr. Hector, that in New Zealand immense glaciers"
2009,"formerly descended to a low level; and the same plants, found by Dr."
2009,Hooker on widely separated mountains in this island tell the same story
2009,of a former cold period. From facts communicated to me by the Rev. W.B.
2009,"Clarke, it appears also that there are traces of former glacial action"
2009,on the mountains of the south-eastern corner of Australia.
2009,
2009,"Looking to America: in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of rock"
2009,"have been observed on the eastern side of the continent, as far south as"
2009,"latitude  and  degrees, and on the shores of the Pacific, where"
2009,"the climate is now so different, as far south as latitude  degrees."
2009,"Erratic boulders have, also, been noticed on the Rocky Mountains. In"
2009,"the Cordillera of South America, nearly under the equator, glaciers once"
2009,extended far below their present level. In central Chile I examined
2009,"a vast mound of detritus with great boulders, crossing the Portillo"
2009,"valley, which, there can hardly be a doubt, once formed a huge moraine;"
2009,and Mr. D. Forbes informs me that he found in various parts of the
2009,"Cordillera, from latitude  to  degrees south, at about the height of"
2009,", feet, deeply-furrowed rocks, resembling those with which he was"
2009,"familiar in Norway, and likewise great masses of detritus, including"
2009,grooved pebbles. Along this whole space of the Cordillera true glaciers
2009,do not now exist even at much more considerable heights. Further
2009,"south, on both sides of the continent, from latitude  degrees to the"
2009,"southernmost extremity, we have the clearest evidence of former glacial"
2009,"action, in numerous immense boulders transported far from their parent"
2009,source.
2009,
2009,"From these several facts, namely, from the glacial action having"
2009,extended all round the northern and southern hemispheres--from
2009,the period having been in a geological sense recent in both
2009,hemispheres--from its having lasted in both during a great length of
2009,"time, as may be inferred from the amount of work effected--and lastly,"
2009,from glaciers having recently descended to a low level along the whole
2009,"line of the Cordillera, it at one time appeared to me that we could not"
2009,avoid the conclusion that the temperature of the whole world had been
2009,"simultaneously lowered during the Glacial period. But now, Mr. Croll,"
2009,"in a series of admirable memoirs, has attempted to show that a glacial"
2009,"condition of climate is the result of various physical causes, brought"
2009,into operation by an increase in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit.
2009,All these causes tend towards the same end; but the most powerful
2009,appears to be the indirect influence of the eccentricity of the orbit
2009,"upon oceanic currents. According to Mr. Croll, cold periods regularly"
2009,recur every ten or fifteen thousand years; and these at long intervals
2009,"are extremely severe, owing to certain contingencies, of which the most"
2009,"important, as Sir C. Lyell has shown, is the relative position of the"
2009,land and water. Mr. Croll believes that the last great glacial period
2009,"occurred about , years ago, and endured, with slight alterations"
2009,"of climate, for about , years. With respect to more ancient"
2009,"glacial periods, several geologists are convinced, from direct evidence,"
2009,"that such occurred during the miocene and eocene formations, not to"
2009,mention still more ancient formations. But the most important result for
2009,"us, arrived at by Mr. Croll, is that whenever the northern hemisphere"
2009,passes through a cold period the temperature of the southern hemisphere
2009,"is actually raised, with the winters rendered much milder, chiefly"
2009,through changes in the direction of the ocean currents. So conversely it
2009,"will be with the northern hemisphere, while the southern passes through"
2009,a glacial period. This conclusion throws so much light on geographical
2009,distribution that I am strongly inclined to trust in it; but I will
2009,first give the facts which demand an explanation.
2009,
2009,"In South America, Dr. Hooker has shown that besides many closely allied"
2009,"species, between forty and fifty of the flowering plants of Tierra del"
2009,"Fuego, forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty flora, are common to"
2009,"North America and Europe, enormously remote as these areas in opposite"
2009,hemispheres are from each other. On the lofty mountains of equatorial
2009,America a host of peculiar species belonging to European genera occur.
2009,"On the Organ Mountains of Brazil some few temperate European, some"
2009,Antarctic and some Andean genera were found by Gardner which do not
2009,exist in the low intervening hot countries. On the Silla of Caraccas
2009,the illustrious Humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera
2009,characteristic of the Cordillera.
2009,
2009,"In Africa, several forms characteristic of Europe, and some few"
2009,"representatives of the flora of the Cape of Good Hope, occur on the"
2009,mountains of Abyssinia. At the Cape of Good Hope a very few European
2009,"species, believed not to have been introduced by man, and on the"
2009,mountains several representative European forms are found which have
2009,not been discovered in the intertropical parts of Africa. Dr. Hooker has
2009,also lately shown that several of the plants living on the upper parts
2009,"of the lofty island of Fernando Po, and on the neighbouring Cameroon"
2009,"Mountains, in the Gulf of Guinea, are closely related to those on the"
2009,"mountains of Abyssinia, and likewise to those of temperate Europe. It"
2009,"now also appears, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, that some of these same"
2009,temperate plants have been discovered by the Rev. R.T. Lowe on the
2009,mountains of the Cape Verde Islands. This extension of the same
2009,"temperate forms, almost under the equator, across the whole continent of"
2009,"Africa and to the mountains of the Cape Verde archipelago, is one of the"
2009,most astonishing facts ever recorded in the distribution of plants.
2009,
2009,"On the Himalaya, and on the isolated mountain ranges of the peninsula of"
2009,"India, on the heights of Ceylon, and on the volcanic cones of Java, many"
2009,"plants occur either identically the same or representing each other,"
2009,and at the same time representing plants of Europe not found in the
2009,intervening hot lowlands. A list of the genera of plants collected on
2009,"the loftier peaks of Java, raises a picture of a collection made on"
2009,a hillock in Europe. Still more striking is the fact that peculiar
2009,Australian forms are represented by certain plants growing on the
2009,"summits of the mountains of Borneo. Some of these Australian forms, as"
2009,"I hear from Dr. Hooker, extend along the heights of the peninsula of"
2009,"Malacca, and are thinly scattered on the one hand over India, and on the"
2009,other hand as far north as Japan.
2009,
2009,"On the southern mountains of Australia, Dr. F. Muller has discovered"
2009,"several European species; other species, not introduced by man, occur"
2009,"on the lowlands; and a long list can be given, as I am informed by"
2009,"Dr. Hooker, of European genera, found in Australia, but not in the"
2009,"intermediate torrid regions. In the admirable ""Introduction to the Flora"
2009,"of New Zealand,"" by Dr. Hooker, analogous and striking facts are given"
2009,"in regard to the plants of that large island. Hence, we see that certain"
2009,plants growing on the more lofty mountains of the tropics in all parts
2009,"of the world, and on the temperate plains of the north and south, are"
2009,"either the same species or varieties of the same species. It should,"
2009,"however, be observed that these plants are not strictly arctic forms;"
2009,"for, as Mr. H.C. Watson has remarked, ""in receding from polar toward"
2009,"equatorial latitudes, the Alpine or mountain flora really become less"
2009,"and less Arctic."" Besides these identical and closely allied forms, many"
2009,"species inhabiting the same widely sundered areas, belong to genera not"
2009,now found in the intermediate tropical lowlands.
2009,
2009,These brief remarks apply to plants alone; but some few analogous facts
2009,"could be given in regard to terrestrial animals. In marine productions,"
2009,"similar cases likewise occur; as an example, I may quote a statement"
2009,"by the highest authority, Prof. Dana, that ""it is certainly a wonderful"
2009,fact that New Zealand should have a closer resemblance in its crustacea
2009,"to Great Britain, its antipode, than to any other part of the world."""
2009,"Sir J. Richardson, also, speaks of the reappearance on the shores of New"
2009,"Zealand, Tasmania, etc., of northern forms of fish. Dr. Hooker informs"
2009,me that twenty-five species of Algae are common to New Zealand and to
2009,"Europe, but have not been found in the intermediate tropical seas."
2009,
2009,"From the foregoing facts, namely, the presence of temperate forms"
2009,"on the highlands across the whole of equatorial Africa, and along the"
2009,"Peninsula of India, to Ceylon and the Malay Archipelago, and in a less"
2009,"well-marked manner across the wide expanse of tropical South America, it"
2009,"appears almost certain that at some former period, no doubt during"
2009,"the most severe part of a Glacial period, the lowlands of these great"
2009,continents were everywhere tenanted under the equator by a considerable
2009,number of temperate forms. At this period the equatorial climate at the
2009,level of the sea was probably about the same with that now experienced
2009,"at the height of from five to six thousand feet under the same latitude,"
2009,"or perhaps even rather cooler. During this, the coldest period, the"
2009,lowlands under the equator must have been clothed with a mingled
2009,"tropical and temperate vegetation, like that described by Hooker as"
2009,growing luxuriantly at the height of from four to five thousand feet
2009,"on the lower slopes of the Himalaya, but with perhaps a still greater"
2009,preponderance of temperate forms. So again in the mountainous island of
2009,"Fernando Po, in the Gulf of Guinea, Mr. Mann found temperate European"
2009,forms beginning to appear at the height of about five thousand feet. On
2009,"the mountains of Panama, at the height of only two thousand feet, Dr."
2009,"Seemann found the vegetation like that of Mexico, ""with forms of the"
2009,"torrid zone harmoniously blended with those of the temperate."""
2009,
2009,Now let us see whether Mr. Croll's conclusion that when the northern
2009,"hemisphere suffered from the extreme cold of the great Glacial period,"
2009,"the southern hemisphere was actually warmer, throws any clear light on"
2009,the present apparently inexplicable distribution of various organisms
2009,"in the temperate parts of both hemispheres, and on the mountains of the"
2009,"tropics. The Glacial period, as measured by years, must have been very"
2009,long; and when we remember over what vast spaces some naturalised plants
2009,"and animals have spread within a few centuries, this period will have"
2009,been ample for any amount of migration. As the cold became more and more
2009,"intense, we know that Arctic forms invaded the temperate regions; and"
2009,"from the facts just given, there can hardly be a doubt that some of the"
2009,"more vigorous, dominant and widest-spreading temperate forms invaded the"
2009,equatorial lowlands. The inhabitants of these hot lowlands would at the
2009,same time have migrated to the tropical and subtropical regions of the
2009,"south, for the southern hemisphere was at this period warmer. On the"
2009,"decline of the Glacial period, as both hemispheres gradually recovered"
2009,"their former temperature, the northern temperate forms living on the"
2009,"lowlands under the equator, would have been driven to their former homes"
2009,"or have been destroyed, being replaced by the equatorial forms returning"
2009,"from the south. Some, however, of the northern temperate forms would"
2009,"almost certainly have ascended any adjoining high land, where, if"
2009,"sufficiently lofty, they would have long survived like the Arctic"
2009,"forms on the mountains of Europe. They might have survived, even if the"
2009,"climate was not perfectly fitted for them, for the change of temperature"
2009,"must have been very slow, and plants undoubtedly possess a certain"
2009,"capacity for acclimatisation, as shown by their transmitting to their"
2009,offspring different constitutional powers of resisting heat and cold.
2009,
2009,In the regular course of events the southern hemisphere would in
2009,"its turn be subjected to a severe Glacial period, with the northern"
2009,hemisphere rendered warmer; and then the southern temperate forms would
2009,invade the equatorial lowlands. The northern forms which had before been
2009,left on the mountains would now descend and mingle with the southern
2009,"forms. These latter, when the warmth returned, would return to their"
2009,"former homes, leaving some few species on the mountains, and carrying"
2009,southward with them some of the northern temperate forms which had
2009,"descended from their mountain fastnesses. Thus, we should have some"
2009,few species identically the same in the northern and southern temperate
2009,zones and on the mountains of the intermediate tropical regions. But
2009,"the species left during a long time on these mountains, or in opposite"
2009,"hemispheres, would have to compete with many new forms and would be"
2009,"exposed to somewhat different physical conditions; hence, they would"
2009,"be eminently liable to modification, and would generally now exist as"
2009,"varieties or as representative species; and this is the case. We must,"
2009,"also, bear in mind the occurrence in both hemispheres of former Glacial"
2009,"periods; for these will account, in accordance with the same principles,"
2009,for the many quite distinct species inhabiting the same widely separated
2009,"areas, and belonging to genera not now found in the intermediate torrid"
2009,zones.
2009,
2009,"It is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard to"
2009,"America, and by Alph. de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many more"
2009,identical or slightly modified species have migrated from the north to
2009,"the south, than in a reversed direction. We see, however, a few southern"
2009,forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia. I suspect that this
2009,preponderant migration from the north to the south is due to the greater
2009,"extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms having existed"
2009,"in their own homes in greater numbers, and having consequently been"
2009,advanced through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of
2009,"perfection, or dominating power, than the southern forms. And thus, when"
2009,"the two sets became commingled in the equatorial regions, during the"
2009,"alternations of the Glacial periods, the northern forms were the more"
2009,"powerful and were able to hold their places on the mountains, and"
2009,afterwards migrate southward with the southern forms; but not so the
2009,"southern in regard to the northern forms. In the same manner, at the"
2009,"present day, we see that very many European productions cover the ground"
2009,"in La Plata, New Zealand, and to a lesser degree in Australia, and have"
2009,beaten the natives; whereas extremely few southern forms have become
2009,"naturalised in any part of the northern hemisphere, though hides, wool,"
2009,and other objects likely to carry seeds have been largely imported into
2009,Europe during the last two or three centuries from La Plata and during
2009,the last forty or fifty years from Australia. The Neilgherrie Mountains
2009,"in India, however, offer a partial exception; for here, as I hear from"
2009,"Dr. Hooker, Australian forms are rapidly sowing themselves and becoming"
2009,"naturalised. Before the last great Glacial period, no doubt the"
2009,intertropical mountains were stocked with endemic Alpine forms;
2009,but these have almost everywhere yielded to the more dominant forms
2009,generated in the larger areas and more efficient workshops of the north.
2009,"In many islands the native productions are nearly equalled, or even"
2009,"outnumbered, by those which have become naturalised; and this is the"
2009,first stage towards their extinction. Mountains are islands on the land;
2009,and their inhabitants have yielded to those produced within the larger
2009,"areas of the north, just in the same way as the inhabitants of real"
2009,islands have everywhere yielded and are still yielding to continental
2009,forms naturalised through man's agency.
2009,
2009,The same principles apply to the distribution of terrestrial animals and
2009,"of marine productions, in the northern and southern temperate zones, and"
2009,"on the intertropical mountains. When, during the height of the Glacial"
2009,"period, the ocean-currents were widely different to what they now are,"
2009,some of the inhabitants of the temperate seas might have reached
2009,the equator; of these a few would perhaps at once be able to migrate
2009,"southwards, by keeping to the cooler currents, while others might remain"
2009,and survive in the colder depths until the southern hemisphere was in
2009,its turn subjected to a glacial climate and permitted their further
2009,"progress; in nearly the same manner as, according to Forbes, isolated"
2009,spaces inhabited by Arctic productions exist to the present day in the
2009,deeper parts of the northern temperate seas.
2009,
2009,I am far from supposing that all the difficulties in regard to the
2009,"distribution and affinities of the identical and allied species, which"
2009,"now live so widely separated in the north and south, and sometimes on"
2009,"the intermediate mountain ranges, are removed on the views above given."
2009,The exact lines of migration cannot be indicated. We cannot say why
2009,certain species and not others have migrated; why certain species
2009,"have been modified and have given rise to new forms, while others have"
2009,"remained unaltered. We cannot hope to explain such facts, until we can"
2009,say why one species and not another becomes naturalised by man's agency
2009,"in a foreign land; why one species ranges twice or thrice as far, and is"
2009,"twice or thrice as common, as another species within their own homes."
2009,
2009,"Various special difficulties also remain to be solved; for instance,"
2009,"the occurrence, as shown by Dr. Hooker, of the same plants at points"
2009,"so enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia; but"
2009,"icebergs, as suggested by Lyell, may have been concerned in their"
2009,dispersal. The existence at these and other distant points of the
2009,"southern hemisphere, of species, which, though distinct, belong to"
2009,"genera exclusively confined to the south, is a more remarkable case."
2009,"Some of these species are so distinct, that we cannot suppose that there"
2009,has been time since the commencement of the last Glacial period for
2009,their migration and subsequent modification to the necessary degree.
2009,The facts seem to indicate that distinct species belonging to the same
2009,genera have migrated in radiating lines from a common centre; and I am
2009,"inclined to look in the southern, as in the northern hemisphere, to a"
2009,"former and warmer period, before the commencement of the last Glacial"
2009,"period, when the Antarctic lands, now covered with ice, supported a"
2009,highly peculiar and isolated flora. It may be suspected that before this
2009,"flora was exterminated during the last Glacial epoch, a few forms"
2009,had been already widely dispersed to various points of the southern
2009,"hemisphere by occasional means of transport, and by the aid, as"
2009,"halting-places, of now sunken islands. Thus the southern shores of"
2009,"America, Australia, and New Zealand may have become slightly tinted by"
2009,the same peculiar forms of life.
2009,
2009,"Sir C. Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language almost"
2009,"identical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of climate"
2009,throughout the world on geographical distribution. And we have now seen
2009,that Mr. Croll's conclusion that successive Glacial periods in the one
2009,"hemisphere coincide with warmer periods in the opposite hemisphere,"
2009,"together with the admission of the slow modification of species,"
2009,explains a multitude of facts in the distribution of the same and of the
2009,allied forms of life in all parts of the globe. The living waters have
2009,flowed during one period from the north and during another from the
2009,"south, and in both cases have reached the equator; but the stream of"
2009,life has flowed with greater force from the north than in the opposite
2009,"direction, and has consequently more freely inundated the south. As the"
2009,"tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines, rising higher on the shores"
2009,"where the tide rises highest, so have the living waters left their"
2009,"living drift on our mountain summits, in a line gently rising from"
2009,the Arctic lowlands to a great latitude under the equator. The various
2009,"beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races of man,"
2009,driven up and surviving in the mountain fastnesses of almost every
2009,"land, which serves as a record, full of interest to us, of the former"
2009,inhabitants of the surrounding lowlands.

2009,
2009,FRESH-WATER PRODUCTIONS.
2009,
2009,As lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers of
2009,"land, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would not"
2009,"have ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is apparently"
2009,"a still more formidable barrier, that they would never have extended to"
2009,distant countries. But the case is exactly the reverse. Not only have
2009,"many fresh-water species, belonging to different classes, an enormous"
2009,"range, but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout"
2009,"the world. When first collecting in the fresh waters of Brazil, I well"
2009,remember feeling much surprise at the similarity of the fresh-water
2009,"insects, shells, etc., and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding"
2009,"terrestrial beings, compared with those of Britain."
2009,
2009,"But the wide ranging power of fresh-water productions can, I think,"
2009,"in most cases be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner"
2009,"highly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations from pond"
2009,"to pond, or from stream to stream, within their own countries; and"
2009,liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost
2009,"necessary consequence. We can here consider only a few cases; of these,"
2009,some of the most difficult to explain are presented by fish. It was
2009,formerly believed that the same fresh-water species never existed on
2009,two continents distant from each other. But Dr. Gunther has lately
2009,"shown that the Galaxias attenuatus inhabits Tasmania, New Zealand, the"
2009,Falkland Islands and the mainland of South America. This is a wonderful
2009,"case, and probably indicates dispersal from an Antarctic centre during a"
2009,"former warm period. This case, however, is rendered in some degree less"
2009,surprising by the species of this genus having the power of crossing by
2009,some unknown means considerable spaces of open ocean: thus there is
2009,"one species common to New Zealand and to the Auckland Islands, though"
2009,separated by a distance of about  miles. On the same continent
2009,"fresh-water fish often range widely, and as if capriciously; for in two"
2009,adjoining river systems some of the species may be the same and some
2009,wholly different.
2009,
2009,It is probable that they are occasionally transported by what may be
2009,called accidental means. Thus fishes still alive are not very rarely
2009,dropped at distant points by whirlwinds; and it is known that the ova
2009,retain their vitality for a considerable time after removal from the
2009,"water. Their dispersal may, however, be mainly attributed to changes in"
2009,"the level of the land within the recent period, causing rivers to flow"
2009,"into each other. Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred"
2009,"during floods, without any change of level. The wide differences of the"
2009,"fish on the opposite sides of most mountain-ranges, which are continuous"
2009,"and consequently must, from an early period, have completely prevented"
2009,"the inosculation of the river systems on the two sides, leads to the"
2009,"same conclusion. Some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms,"
2009,and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical
2009,"changes, and consequently time and means for much migration. Moreover,"
2009,Dr. Gunther has recently been led by several considerations to infer
2009,that with fishes the same forms have a long endurance. Salt-water
2009,"fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and,"
2009,"according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of which"
2009,"all the members are confined to fresh water, so that a marine species"
2009,belonging to a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores
2009,"of the sea, and could, it is probable, become adapted without much"
2009,difficulty to the fresh waters of a distant land.
2009,
2009,"Some species of fresh-water shells have very wide ranges, and allied"
2009,"species which, on our theory, are descended from a common parent, and"
2009,"must have proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world."
2009,"Their distribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not"
2009,"likely to be transported by birds; and the ova, as well as the adults,"
2009,are immediately killed by sea-water. I could not even understand
2009,how some naturalised species have spread rapidly throughout the same
2009,"country. But two facts, which I have observed--and many others no"
2009,doubt will be discovered--throw some light on this subject. When ducks
2009,"suddenly emerge from a pond covered with duck-weed, I have twice seen"
2009,"these little plants adhering to their backs; and it has happened to me,"
2009,"in removing a little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that I have"
2009,unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the other.
2009,But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended the feet of a
2009,"duck in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching;"
2009,and I found that numbers of the extremely minute and just-hatched shells
2009,"crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out"
2009,"of the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more"
2009,advanced age they would voluntarily drop off. These just-hatched
2009,"molluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet,"
2009,"in damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time"
2009,"a duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and"
2009,"if blown across the sea to an oceanic island, or to any other distant"
2009,"point, would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet. Sir Charles Lyell"
2009,informs me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus (a fresh-water
2009,shell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a water-beetle of
2009,"the same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board the ""Beagle,"" when"
2009,forty-five miles distant from the nearest land: how much farther it
2009,might have been blown by a favouring gale no one can tell.
2009,
2009,"With respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many"
2009,"fresh-water, and even marsh-species, have, both over continents and"
2009,"to the most remote oceanic islands. This is strikingly illustrated,"
2009,"according to Alph. de Candolle, in those large groups of terrestrial"
2009,"plants, which have very few aquatic members; for the latter seem"
2009,"immediately to acquire, as if in consequence, a wide range. I think"
2009,favourable means of dispersal explain this fact. I have before mentioned
2009,that earth occasionally adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks
2009,"of birds. Wading birds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds, if"
2009,"suddenly flushed, would be the most likely to have muddy feet. Birds"
2009,of this order wander more than those of any other; and are occasionally
2009,found on the most remote and barren islands of the open ocean; they
2009,"would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea, so that any"
2009,"dirt on their feet would not be washed off; and when gaining the land,"
2009,they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water haunts. I do not
2009,believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with
2009,"seeds: I have tried several little experiments, but will here give only"
2009,the most striking case: I took in February three tablespoonfuls of mud
2009,"from three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little"
2009,pond; this mud when dry weighed only  and / ounces; I kept it covered
2009,"up in my study for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it"
2009,"grew; the plants were of many kinds, and were altogether  in number;"
2009,and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! Considering
2009,"these facts, I think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if"
2009,water-birds did not transport the seeds of fresh-water plants to
2009,"unstocked ponds and streams, situated at very distant points. The same"
2009,agency may have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller
2009,fresh-water animals.
2009,
2009,Other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. I have
2009,"stated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they reject"
2009,many other kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish swallow
2009,"seeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and Potamogeton."
2009,"Herons and other birds, century after century, have gone on daily"
2009,"devouring fish; they then take flight and go to other waters, or are"
2009,blown across the sea; and we have seen that seeds retain their power of
2009,"germination, when rejected many hours afterwards in pellets or in"
2009,the excrement. When I saw the great size of the seeds of that fine
2009,"water-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph. de Candolle's remarks"
2009,"on the distribution of this plant, I thought that the means of its"
2009,dispersal must remain inexplicable; but Audubon states that he found
2009,the seeds of the great southern water-lily (probably according to Dr.
2009,"Hooker, the Nelumbium luteum) in a heron's stomach. Now this bird must"
2009,"often have flown with its stomach thus well stocked to distant ponds,"
2009,"and, then getting a hearty meal of fish, analogy makes me believe"
2009,that it would have rejected the seeds in the pellet in a fit state for
2009,germination.
2009,
2009,"In considering these several means of distribution, it should be"
2009,"remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance on a"
2009,"rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will have"
2009,a good chance of succeeding. Although there will always be a struggle
2009,"for life between the inhabitants of the same pond, however few in kind,"
2009,yet as the number even in a well-stocked pond is small in comparison
2009,"with the number of species inhabiting an equal area of land, the"
2009,competition between them will probably be less severe than between
2009,terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a
2009,"foreign country would have a better chance of seizing on a new place,"
2009,than in the case of terrestrial colonists. We should also remember that
2009,"many fresh-water productions are low in the scale of nature, and we have"
2009,reason to believe that such beings become modified more slowly than the
2009,high; and this will give time for the migration of aquatic species.
2009,We should not forget the probability of many fresh-water forms having
2009,"formerly ranged continuously over immense areas, and then having become"
2009,extinct at intermediate points. But the wide distribution of fresh-water
2009,"plants, and of the lower animals, whether retaining the same identical"
2009,"form, or in some degree modified, apparently depends in main part on the"
2009,"wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals, more especially by"
2009,"fresh-water birds, which have great powers of flight, and naturally"
2009,travel from one piece of water to another.
2009,
2009,ON THE INHABITANTS OF OCEANIC ISLANDS.
2009,
2009,"We now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which I have"
2009,selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty with respect to
2009,"distribution, on the view that not only all the individuals of the"
2009,"same species have migrated from some one area, but that allied species,"
2009,"although now inhabiting the most distant points, have proceeded from a"
2009,"single area, the birthplace of their early progenitors. I have already"
2009,given my reasons for disbelieving in continental extensions within the
2009,period of existing species on so enormous a scale that all the many
2009,islands of the several oceans were thus stocked with their present
2009,"terrestrial inhabitants. This view removes many difficulties, but it"
2009,does not accord with all the facts in regard to the productions of
2009,islands. In the following remarks I shall not confine myself to the mere
2009,"question of dispersal, but shall consider some other cases bearing on"
2009,the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent
2009,with modification.
2009,
2009,The species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number
2009,compared with those on equal continental areas: Alph. de Candolle admits
2009,"this for plants, and Wollaston for insects. New Zealand, for instance,"
2009,"with its lofty mountains and diversified stations, extending over "
2009,"miles of latitude, together with the outlying islands of Auckland,"
2009,"Campbell and Chatham, contain altogether only  kinds of flowering"
2009,plants; if we compare this moderate number with the species which swarm
2009,"over equal areas in Southwestern Australia or at the Cape of Good Hope,"
2009,"we must admit that some cause, independently of different physical"
2009,"conditions, has given rise to so great a difference in number. Even the"
2009,"uniform county of Cambridge has  plants, and the little island of"
2009,"Anglesea , but a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included"
2009,"in these numbers, and the comparison in some other respects is not quite"
2009,fair. We have evidence that the barren island of Ascension aboriginally
2009,possessed less than half-a-dozen flowering plants; yet many species have
2009,"now become naturalised on it, as they have in New Zealand and on every"
2009,other oceanic island which can be named. In St. Helena there is reason
2009,to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite
2009,exterminated many native productions. He who admits the doctrine of the
2009,"creation of each separate species, will have to admit that a sufficient"
2009,number of the best adapted plants and animals were not created for
2009,oceanic islands; for man has unintentionally stocked them far more fully
2009,and perfectly than did nature.
2009,
2009,"Although in oceanic islands the species are few in number, the"
2009,proportion of endemic kinds (i.e. those found nowhere else in the world)
2009,"is often extremely large. If we compare, for instance, the number of"
2009,"endemic land-shells in Madeira, or of endemic birds in the Galapagos"
2009,"Archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and then compare"
2009,"the area of the island with that of the continent, we shall see that"
2009,"this is true. This fact might have been theoretically expected, for, as"
2009,"already explained, species occasionally arriving, after long intervals"
2009,"of time in the new and isolated district, and having to compete with new"
2009,"associates, would be eminently liable to modification, and would often"
2009,"produce groups of modified descendants. But it by no means follows that,"
2009,"because in an island nearly all the species of one class are peculiar,"
2009,"those of another class, or of another section of the same class, are"
2009,peculiar; and this difference seems to depend partly on the species
2009,"which are not modified having immigrated in a body, so that their mutual"
2009,relations have not been much disturbed; and partly on the frequent
2009,"arrival of unmodified immigrants from the mother-country, with which"
2009,the insular forms have intercrossed. It should be borne in mind that the
2009,offspring of such crosses would certainly gain in vigour; so that even
2009,an occasional cross would produce more effect than might have been
2009,anticipated. I will give a few illustrations of the foregoing remarks:
2009,in the Galapagos Islands there are twenty-six land birds; of these
2009,twenty-one (or perhaps twenty-three) are peculiar; whereas of the eleven
2009,marine birds only two are peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds
2009,could arrive at these islands much more easily and frequently than
2009,"land-birds. Bermuda, on the other hand, which lies at about the same"
2009,distance from North America as the Galapagos Islands do from South
2009,"America, and which has a very peculiar soil, does not possess a single"
2009,endemic land bird; and we know from Mr. J.M. Jones's admirable account
2009,"of Bermuda, that very many North American birds occasionally or even"
2009,"frequently visit this island. Almost every year, as I am informed by"
2009,"Mr. E.V. Harcourt, many European and African birds are blown to Madeira;"
2009,"this island is inhabited by ninety-nine kinds, of which one alone is"
2009,"peculiar, though very closely related to a European form; and three or"
2009,four other species are confined to this island and to the Canaries.
2009,So that the islands of Bermuda and Madeira have been stocked from the
2009,"neighbouring continents with birds, which for long ages have there"
2009,"struggled together, and have become mutually co-adapted. Hence, when"
2009,"settled in their new homes, each kind will have been kept by the others"
2009,"to its proper place and habits, and will consequently have been but"
2009,little liable to modification. Any tendency to modification will also
2009,"have been checked by intercrossing with the unmodified immigrants,"
2009,often arriving from the mother-country. Madeira again is inhabited by
2009,"a wonderful number of peculiar land-shells, whereas not one species"
2009,"of sea-shell is peculiar to its shores: now, though we do not know how"
2009,"sea-shells are dispersed, yet we can see that their eggs or larvae,"
2009,"perhaps attached to seaweed or floating timber, or to the feet of wading"
2009,"birds, might be transported across three or four hundred miles of open"
2009,sea far more easily than land-shells. The different orders of insects
2009,inhabiting Madeira present nearly parallel cases.
2009,
2009,Oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in animals of certain whole
2009,"classes, and their places are occupied by other classes; thus in the"
2009,"Galapagos Islands reptiles, and in New Zealand gigantic wingless birds,"
2009,"take, or recently took, the place of mammals. Although New Zealand"
2009,"is here spoken of as an oceanic island, it is in some degree doubtful"
2009,"whether it should be so ranked; it is of large size, and is not"
2009,separated from Australia by a profoundly deep sea; from its geological
2009,"character and the direction of its mountain ranges, the Rev. W.B. Clarke"
2009,"has lately maintained that this island, as well as New Caledonia, should"
2009,"be considered as appurtenances of Australia. Turning to plants, Dr."
2009,Hooker has shown that in the Galapagos Islands the proportional numbers
2009,of the different orders are very different from what they are elsewhere.
2009,"All such differences in number, and the absence of certain whole"
2009,"groups of animals and plants, are generally accounted for by supposed"
2009,differences in the physical conditions of the islands; but this
2009,explanation is not a little doubtful. Facility of immigration seems to
2009,have been fully as important as the nature of the conditions.
2009,
2009,Many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the
2009,"inhabitants of oceanic islands. For instance, in certain islands not"
2009,"tenanted by a single mammal, some of the endemic plants have beautifully"
2009,hooked seeds; yet few relations are more manifest than that hooks serve
2009,for the transportal of seeds in the wool or fur of quadrupeds. But a
2009,hooked seed might be carried to an island by other means; and the plant
2009,"then becoming modified would form an endemic species, still retaining"
2009,"its hooks, which would form a useless appendage, like the shrivelled"
2009,"wings under the soldered wing-covers of many insular beetles. Again,"
2009,islands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which
2009,"elsewhere include only herbaceous species; now trees, as Alph. de"
2009,"Candolle has shown, generally have, whatever the cause may be, confined"
2009,ranges. Hence trees would be little likely to reach distant oceanic
2009,"islands; and an herbaceous plant, which had no chance of successfully"
2009,"competing with the many fully developed trees growing on a continent,"
2009,"might, when established on an island, gain an advantage over other"
2009,herbaceous plants by growing taller and taller and overtopping them.
2009,"In this case, natural selection would tend to add to the stature of the"
2009,"plant, to whatever order it belonged, and thus first convert it into a"
2009,bush and then into a tree.
2009,
2009,ABSENCE OF BATRACHIANS AND TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS ON OCEANIC ISLANDS.
2009,
2009,With respect to the absence of whole orders of animals on oceanic
2009,"islands, Bory St. Vincent long ago remarked that Batrachians (frogs,"
2009,"toads, newts) are never found on any of the many islands with which the"
2009,"great oceans are studded. I have taken pains to verify this assertion,"
2009,"and have found it true, with the exception of New Zealand, New"
2009,"Caledonia, the Andaman Islands, and perhaps the Solomon Islands and the"
2009,Seychelles. But I have already remarked that it is doubtful whether New
2009,Zealand and New Caledonia ought to be classed as oceanic islands; and
2009,this is still more doubtful with respect to the Andaman and Solomon
2009,"groups and the Seychelles. This general absence of frogs, toads and"
2009,newts on so many true oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their
2009,physical conditions; indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly fitted
2009,"for these animals; for frogs have been introduced into Madeira, the"
2009,"Azores, and Mauritius, and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance."
2009,But as these animals and their spawn are immediately killed (with the
2009,"exception, as far as known, of one Indian species) by sea-water, there"
2009,"would be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea, and"
2009,therefore we can see why they do not exist on strictly oceanic islands.
2009,"But why, on the theory of creation, they should not have been created"
2009,"there, it would be very difficult to explain."
2009,
2009,Mammals offer another and similar case. I have carefully searched the
2009,"oldest voyages, and have not found a single instance, free from doubt,"
2009,of a terrestrial mammal (excluding domesticated animals kept by the
2009,natives) inhabiting an island situated above  miles from a continent
2009,or great continental island; and many islands situated at a much less
2009,"distance are equally barren. The Falkland Islands, which are inhabited"
2009,"by a wolf-like fox, come nearest to an exception; but this group cannot"
2009,"be considered as oceanic, as it lies on a bank in connection with the"
2009,"mainland at a distance of about  miles; moreover, icebergs formerly"
2009,"brought boulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly"
2009,"transported foxes, as now frequently happens in the arctic regions. Yet"
2009,it cannot be said that small islands will not support at least small
2009,"mammals, for they occur in many parts of the world on very small"
2009,"islands, when lying close to a continent; and hardly an island can be"
2009,named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and
2009,"greatly multiplied. It cannot be said, on the ordinary view of creation,"
2009,that there has not been time for the creation of mammals; many volcanic
2009,"islands are sufficiently ancient, as shown by the stupendous degradation"
2009,"which they have suffered, and by their tertiary strata: there has also"
2009,been time for the production of endemic species belonging to other
2009,classes; and on continents it is known that new species of mammals
2009,appear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals.
2009,"Although terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands, aerial"
2009,mammals do occur on almost every island. New Zealand possesses two bats
2009,"found nowhere else in the world: Norfolk Island, the Viti Archipelago,"
2009,"the Bonin Islands, the Caroline and Marianne Archipelagoes, and"
2009,"Mauritius, all possess their peculiar bats. Why, it may be asked, has"
2009,the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on
2009,remote islands? On my view this question can easily be answered; for no
2009,"terrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide space of sea, but"
2009,bats can fly across. Bats have been seen wandering by day far over the
2009,"Atlantic Ocean; and two North American species, either regularly or"
2009,"occasionally, visit Bermuda, at the distance of  miles from the"
2009,"mainland. I hear from Mr. Tomes, who has specially studied this family,"
2009,"that many species have enormous ranges, and are found on continents"
2009,"and on far distant islands. Hence, we have only to suppose that such"
2009,wandering species have been modified in their new homes in relation to
2009,"their new position, and we can understand the presence of endemic bats"
2009,"on oceanic islands, with the absence of all other terrestrial mammals."
2009,
2009,"Another interesting relation exists, namely, between the depth of the"
2009,"sea separating islands from each other, or from the nearest continent,"
2009,and the degree of affinity of their mammalian inhabitants. Mr. Windsor
2009,"Earl has made some striking observations on this head, since greatly"
2009,"extended by Mr. Wallace's admirable researches, in regard to the great"
2009,"Malay Archipelago, which is traversed near Celebes by a space of deep"
2009,"ocean, and this separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas. On"
2009,"either side, the islands stand on a moderately shallow submarine"
2009,"bank, and these islands are inhabited by the same or by closely allied"
2009,quadrupeds. I have not as yet had time to follow up this subject in all
2009,"quarters of the world; but as far as I have gone, the relation holds"
2009,"good. For instance, Britain is separated by a shallow channel from"
2009,"Europe, and the mammals are the same on both sides; and so it is with"
2009,"all the islands near the shores of Australia. The West Indian Islands,"
2009,"on the other hand, stand on a deeply submerged bank, nearly one thousand"
2009,"fathoms in depth, and here we find American forms, but the species and"
2009,even the genera are quite distinct. As the amount of modification which
2009,"animals of all kinds undergo partly depends on the lapse of time, and as"
2009,"the islands which are separated from each other, or from the mainland,"
2009,"by shallow channels, are more likely to have been continuously united"
2009,"within a recent period than the islands separated by deeper channels, we"
2009,can understand how it is that a relation exists between the depth of the
2009,"sea separating two mammalian faunas, and the degree of their affinity,"
2009,a relation which is quite inexplicable on the theory of independent acts
2009,of creation.
2009,
2009,The foregoing statements in regard to the inhabitants of oceanic
2009,"islands, namely, the fewness of the species, with a large proportion"
2009,"consisting of endemic forms--the members of certain groups, but not"
2009,"those of other groups in the same class, having been modified--the"
2009,"absence of certain whole orders, as of batrachians and of terrestrial"
2009,"mammals, notwithstanding the presence of aerial bats, the singular"
2009,"proportions of certain orders of plants, herbaceous forms having been"
2009,"developed into trees, etc., seem to me to accord better with the belief"
2009,"in the efficiency of occasional means of transport, carried on during"
2009,"a long course of time, than with the belief in the former connection of"
2009,all oceanic islands with the nearest continent; for on this latter
2009,view it is probable that the various classes would have immigrated more
2009,"uniformly, and from the species having entered in a body, their mutual"
2009,"relations would not have been much disturbed, and consequently, they"
2009,"would either have not been modified, or all the species in a more"
2009,equable manner.
2009,
2009,I do not deny that there are many and serious difficulties in
2009,"understanding how many of the inhabitants of the more remote islands,"
2009,"whether still retaining the same specific form or subsequently modified,"
2009,have reached their present homes. But the probability of other islands
2009,"having once existed as halting-places, of which not a wreck now remains,"
2009,must not be overlooked. I will specify one difficult case. Almost all
2009,"oceanic islands, even the most isolated and smallest, are inhabited"
2009,"by land-shells, generally by endemic species, but sometimes by species"
2009,found elsewhere striking instances of which have been given by Dr. A.A.
2009,Gould in relation to the Pacific. Now it is notorious that land-shells
2009,"are easily killed by sea-water; their eggs, at least such as I have"
2009,"tried, sink in it and are killed. Yet there must be some unknown,"
2009,but occasionally efficient means for their transportal. Would the
2009,just-hatched young sometimes adhere to the feet of birds roosting on
2009,"the ground and thus get transported? It occurred to me that land-shells,"
2009,when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the
2009,"shell, might be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately"
2009,wide arms of the sea. And I find that several species in this state
2009,withstand uninjured an immersion in sea-water during seven days. One
2009,"shell, the Helix pomatia, after having been thus treated, and again"
2009,"hybernating, was put into sea-water for twenty days and perfectly"
2009,recovered. During this length of time the shell might have been
2009,carried by a marine country of average swiftness to a distance of 
2009,geographical miles. As this Helix has a thick calcareous operculum
2009,"I removed it, and when it had formed a new membranous one, I again"
2009,"immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and again it recovered and"
2009,crawled away. Baron Aucapitaine has since tried similar experiments. He
2009,"placed  land-shells, belonging to ten species, in a box pierced with"
2009,"holes, and immersed it for a fortnight in the sea. Out of the hundred"
2009,shells twenty-seven recovered. The presence of an operculum seems
2009,"to have been of importance, as out of twelve specimens of Cyclostoma"
2009,"elegans, which is thus furnished, eleven revived. It is remarkable,"
2009,"seeing how well the Helix pomatia resisted with me the salt-water, that"
2009,not one of fifty-four specimens belonging to four other species of Helix
2009,"tried by Aucapitaine recovered. It is, however, not at all probable that"
2009,land-shells have often been thus transported; the feet of birds offer a
2009,more probable method.
2009,
2009,ON THE RELATIONS OF THE INHABITANTS OF ISLANDS TO THOSE OF THE NEAREST
2009,MAINLAND.
2009,
2009,The most striking and important fact for us is the affinity of the
2009,"species which inhabit islands to those of the nearest mainland,"
2009,without being actually the same. Numerous instances could be given. The
2009,"Galapagos Archipelago, situated under the equator, lies at a distance of"
2009,between  and  miles from the shores of South America. Here almost
2009,every product of the land and of the water bears the unmistakable stamp
2009,of the American continent. There are twenty-six land birds. Of these
2009,"twenty-one, or perhaps twenty-three, are ranked as distinct species,"
2009,and would commonly be assumed to have been here created; yet the close
2009,affinity of most of these birds to American species is manifest in every
2009,"character in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice. So it is with"
2009,"the other animals, and with a large proportion of the plants, as"
2009,shown by Dr. Hooker in his admirable Flora of this archipelago. The
2009,"naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the"
2009,"Pacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent, feels that"
2009,he is standing on American land. Why should this be so? Why should
2009,the species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos
2009,"Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plainly the stamp of affinity to"
2009,"those created in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in"
2009,"the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in"
2009,"the proportions in which the several classes are associated together,"
2009,which closely resembles the conditions of the South American coast. In
2009,"fact, there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. On"
2009,"the other hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the"
2009,"volcanic nature of the soil, in the climate, height, and size of the"
2009,"islands, between the Galapagos and Cape Verde Archipelagos: but what an"
2009,entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! The inhabitants of
2009,"the Cape Verde Islands are related to those of Africa, like those of"
2009,"the Galapagos to America. Facts, such as these, admit of no sort of"
2009,"explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas, on"
2009,"the view here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would"
2009,"be likely to receive colonists from America, whether by occasional means"
2009,of transport or (though I do not believe in this doctrine) by formerly
2009,"continuous land, and the Cape Verde Islands from Africa; such colonists"
2009,would be liable to modification--the principle of inheritance still
2009,betraying their original birthplace.
2009,
2009,Many analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal
2009,rule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the
2009,"nearest continent, or of the nearest large island. The exceptions are"
2009,"few, and most of them can be explained. Thus, although Kerguelen Land"
2009,"stands nearer to Africa than to America, the plants are related, and"
2009,"that very closely, as we know from Dr. Hooker's account, to those of"
2009,America: but on the view that this island has been mainly stocked
2009,"by seeds brought with earth and stones on icebergs, drifted by the"
2009,"prevailing currents, this anomaly disappears. New Zealand in its endemic"
2009,"plants is much more closely related to Australia, the nearest mainland,"
2009,than to any other region: and this is what might have been expected; but
2009,"it is also plainly related to South America, which, although the next"
2009,"nearest continent, is so enormously remote, that the fact becomes an"
2009,anomaly. But this difficulty partially disappears on the view that New
2009,"Zealand, South America, and the other southern lands, have been stocked"
2009,"in part from a nearly intermediate though distant point, namely, from"
2009,"the antarctic islands, when they were clothed with vegetation, during"
2009,"a warmer tertiary period, before the commencement of the last Glacial"
2009,"period. The affinity, which, though feeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker"
2009,"is real, between the flora of the south-western corner of Australia"
2009,"and of the Cape of Good Hope, is a far more remarkable case; but this"
2009,"affinity is confined to the plants, and will, no doubt, some day be"
2009,explained.
2009,
2009,The same law which has determined the relationship between the
2009,"inhabitants of islands and the nearest mainland, is sometimes displayed"
2009,"on a small scale, but in a most interesting manner, within the limits"
2009,of the same archipelago. Thus each separate island of the Galapagos
2009,"Archipelago is tenanted, and the fact is a marvellous one, by many"
2009,distinct species; but these species are related to each other in a very
2009,"much closer manner than to the inhabitants of the American continent,"
2009,or of any other quarter of the world. This is what might have been
2009,"expected, for islands situated so near to each other would almost"
2009,"necessarily receive immigrants from the same original source, and"
2009,from each other. But how is it that many of the immigrants have been
2009,"differently modified, though only in a small degree, in islands situated"
2009,"within sight of each other, having the same geological nature, the same"
2009,"height, climate, etc? This long appeared to me a great difficulty: but"
2009,it arises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of considering
2009,the physical conditions of a country as the most important; whereas it
2009,cannot be disputed that the nature of the other species with which
2009,"each has to compete, is at least as important, and generally a far"
2009,more important element of success. Now if we look to the species which
2009,"inhabit the Galapagos Archipelago, and are likewise found in other"
2009,"parts of the world, we find that they differ considerably in the several"
2009,islands. This difference might indeed have been expected if the
2009,"islands have been stocked by occasional means of transport--a seed, for"
2009,"instance, of one plant having been brought to one island, and that of"
2009,"another plant to another island, though all proceeding from the same"
2009,"general source. Hence, when in former times an immigrant first settled"
2009,"on one of the islands, or when it subsequently spread from one to"
2009,"another, it would undoubtedly be exposed to different conditions in the"
2009,"different islands, for it would have to compete with a different set of"
2009,"organisms; a plant, for instance, would find the ground best-fitted for"
2009,"it occupied by somewhat different species in the different islands, and"
2009,"would be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different enemies. If, then,"
2009,"it varied, natural selection would probably favour different varieties"
2009,"in the different islands. Some species, however, might spread and yet"
2009,"retain the same character throughout the group, just as we see some"
2009,species spreading widely throughout a continent and remaining the same.
2009,
2009,"The really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos Archipelago,"
2009,"and in a lesser degree in some analogous cases, is that each new species"
2009,"after being formed in any one island, did not spread quickly to the"
2009,"other islands. But the islands, though in sight of each other, are"
2009,"separated by deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the British"
2009,"Channel, and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former"
2009,period been continuously united. The currents of the sea are rapid and
2009,"deep between the islands, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare; so"
2009,that the islands are far more effectually separated from each other than
2009,"they appear on a map. Nevertheless, some of the species, both of"
2009,those found in other parts of the world and of those confined to the
2009,"archipelago, are common to the several islands; and we may infer from"
2009,the present manner of distribution that they have spread from one island
2009,"to the others. But we often take, I think, an erroneous view of the"
2009,"probability of closely allied species invading each other's territory,"
2009,"when put into free intercommunication. Undoubtedly, if one species has"
2009,"any advantage over another, it will in a very brief time wholly or in"
2009,part supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for their own
2009,"places, both will probably hold their separate places for almost"
2009,"any length of time. Being familiar with the fact that many species,"
2009,"naturalised through man's agency, have spread with astonishing rapidity"
2009,"over wide areas, we are apt to infer that most species would thus"
2009,spread; but we should remember that the species which become naturalised
2009,in new countries are not generally closely allied to the aboriginal
2009,"inhabitants, but are very distinct forms, belonging in a large"
2009,"proportion of cases, as shown by Alph. de Candolle, to distinct genera."
2009,"In the Galapagos Archipelago, many even of the birds, though so well"
2009,"adapted for flying from island to island, differ on the different"
2009,"islands; thus there are three closely allied species of mocking-thrush,"
2009,each confined to its own island. Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush
2009,"of Chatham Island to be blown to Charles Island, which has its own"
2009,mocking-thrush; why should it succeed in establishing itself there?
2009,We may safely infer that Charles Island is well stocked with its own
2009,"species, for annually more eggs are laid and young birds hatched"
2009,than can possibly be reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush
2009,peculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted for its home as is
2009,the species peculiar to Chatham Island. Sir C. Lyell and Mr. Wollaston
2009,have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject;
2009,"namely, that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo possess many"
2009,"distinct but representative species of land-shells, some of which"
2009,live in crevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone are
2009,"annually transported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this latter island"
2009,"has not become colonised by the Porto Santo species: nevertheless, both"
2009,"islands have been colonised by some European land-shells, which no"
2009,doubt had some advantage over the indigenous species. From these
2009,considerations I think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic species
2009,which inhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago not
2009,"having all spread from island to island. On the same continent, also,"
2009,pre-occupation has probably played an important part in checking the
2009,commingling of the species which inhabit different districts with
2009,"nearly the same physical conditions. Thus, the south-east and south-west"
2009,"corners of Australia have nearly the same physical conditions, and are"
2009,"united by continuous land, yet they are inhabited by a vast number of"
2009,"distinct mammals, birds, and plants; so it is, according to Mr. Bates,"
2009,"with the butterflies and other animals inhabiting the great, open, and"
2009,continuous valley of the Amazons.
2009,
2009,The same principle which governs the general character of the
2009,"inhabitants of oceanic islands, namely, the relation to the source"
2009,"whence colonists could have been most easily derived, together with"
2009,"their subsequent modification, is of the widest application throughout"
2009,"nature. We see this on every mountain-summit, in every lake and marsh."
2009,"For Alpine species, excepting in as far as the same species have become"
2009,"widely spread during the Glacial epoch, are related to those of"
2009,"the surrounding lowlands; thus we have in South America, Alpine"
2009,"humming-birds, Alpine rodents, Alpine plants, etc., all strictly"
2009,"belonging to American forms; and it is obvious that a mountain, as"
2009,"it became slowly upheaved, would be colonised from the surrounding"
2009,"lowlands. So it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes, excepting"
2009,in so far as great facility of transport has allowed the same forms
2009,to prevail throughout large portions of the world. We see the same
2009,principle in the character of most of the blind animals inhabiting the
2009,caves of America and of Europe. Other analogous facts could be given.
2009,"It will, I believe, be found universally true, that wherever in"
2009,"two regions, let them be ever so distant, many closely allied or"
2009,"representative species occur, there will likewise be found some"
2009,"identical species; and wherever many closely-allied species occur,"
2009,there will be found many forms which some naturalists rank as distinct
2009,"species, and others as mere varieties; these doubtful forms showing us"
2009,the steps in the process of modification.
2009,
2009,The relation between the power and extent of migration in certain
2009,"species, either at the present or at some former period, and the"
2009,"existence at remote points of the world of closely allied species, is"
2009,shown in another and more general way. Mr. Gould remarked to me long
2009,"ago, that in those genera of birds which range over the world, many of"
2009,the species have very wide ranges. I can hardly doubt that this rule
2009,"is generally true, though difficult of proof. Among mammals, we see it"
2009,"strikingly displayed in Bats, and in a lesser degree in the Felidae and"
2009,Canidae. We see the same rule in the distribution of butterflies and
2009,"beetles. So it is with most of the inhabitants of fresh water, for many"
2009,"of the genera in the most distinct classes range over the world, and"
2009,"many of the species have enormous ranges. It is not meant that all, but"
2009,that some of the species have very wide ranges in the genera which range
2009,"very widely. Nor is it meant that the species in such genera have, on an"
2009,"average, a very wide range; for this will largely depend on how far the"
2009,"process of modification has gone; for instance, two varieties of the"
2009,"same species inhabit America and Europe, and thus the species has an"
2009,"immense range; but, if variation were to be carried a little further,"
2009,"the two varieties would be ranked as distinct species, and their range"
2009,"would be greatly reduced. Still less is it meant, that species which"
2009,"have the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely, as in the"
2009,"case of certain powerfully-winged birds, will necessarily range widely;"
2009,for we should never forget that to range widely implies not only the
2009,"power of crossing barriers, but the more important power of being"
2009,victorious in distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign
2009,"associates. But according to the view that all the species of a genus,"
2009,"though distributed to the most remote points of the world, are descended"
2009,"from a single progenitor, we ought to find, and I believe as a general"
2009,"rule we do find, that some at least of the species range very widely."
2009,
2009,We should bear in mind that many genera in all classes are of ancient
2009,"origin, and the species in this case will have had ample time for"
2009,"dispersal and subsequent modification. There is also reason to believe,"
2009,"from geological evidence, that within each great class the lower"
2009,organisms change at a slower rate than the higher; consequently they
2009,will have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining
2009,"the same specific character. This fact, together with that of the seeds"
2009,and eggs of most lowly organised forms being very minute and better
2009,"fitted for distant transportal, probably accounts for a law which has"
2009,"long been observed, and which has lately been discussed by Alph. de"
2009,"Candolle in regard to plants, namely, that the lower any group of"
2009,organisms stands the more widely it ranges.
2009,
2009,"The relations just discussed--namely, lower organisms ranging more"
2009,widely than the higher--some of the species of widely-ranging genera
2009,"themselves ranging widely--such facts, as alpine, lacustrine, and"
2009,marsh productions being generally related to those which live on the
2009,surrounding low lands and dry lands--the striking relationship between
2009,the inhabitants of islands and those of the nearest mainland--the still
2009,closer relationship of the distinct inhabitants of the islands of
2009,the same archipelago--are inexplicable on the ordinary view of the
2009,"independent creation of each species, but are explicable if we admit"
2009,"colonisation from the nearest or readiest source, together with the"
2009,subsequent adaptation of the colonists to their new homes.
2009,
2009,SUMMARY OF THE LAST AND PRESENT CHAPTERS.
2009,
2009,In these chapters I have endeavoured to show that if we make due
2009,allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of changes of climate
2009,"and of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred within the"
2009,"recent period, and of other changes which have probably occurred--if we"
2009,remember how ignorant we are with respect to the many curious means of
2009,"occasional transport--if we bear in mind, and this is a very important"
2009,"consideration, how often a species may have ranged continuously over a"
2009,"wide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts--the"
2009,difficulty is not insuperable in believing that all the individuals of
2009,"the same species, wherever found, are descended from common parents."
2009,"And we are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many"
2009,"naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by"
2009,"various general considerations, more especially from the importance"
2009,"of barriers of all kinds, and from the analogical distribution of"
2009,"subgenera, genera, and families."
2009,
2009,"With respect to distinct species belonging to the same genus, which"
2009,on our theory have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same
2009,"allowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of"
2009,"life have changed very slowly, enormous periods of time having been thus"
2009,"granted for their migration, the difficulties are far from insuperable;"
2009,"though in this case, as in that of the individuals of the same species,"
2009,they are often great.
2009,
2009,"As exemplifying the effects of climatical changes on distribution, I"
2009,have attempted to show how important a part the last Glacial period has
2009,"played, which affected even the equatorial regions, and which, during"
2009,"the alternations of the cold in the north and the south, allowed the"
2009,"productions of opposite hemispheres to mingle, and left some of them"
2009,stranded on the mountain-summits in all parts of the world. As showing
2009,"how diversified are the means of occasional transport, I have discussed"
2009,at some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions.
2009,
2009,If the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long
2009,"course of time all the individuals of the same species, and likewise"
2009,"of the several species belonging to the same genus, have proceeded"
2009,from some one source; then all the grand leading facts of geographical
2009,"distribution are explicable on the theory of migration, together with"
2009,subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus
2009,"understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, in"
2009,not only separating but in apparently forming the several zoological and
2009,botanical provinces. We can thus understand the concentration of related
2009,species within the same areas; and how it is that under different
2009,"latitudes, for instance, in South America, the inhabitants of the plains"
2009,"and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are linked together"
2009,"in so mysterious a manner, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings"
2009,which formerly inhabited the same continent. Bearing in mind that the
2009,"mutual relation of organism to organism is of the highest importance,"
2009,"we can see why two areas, having nearly the same physical conditions,"
2009,should often be inhabited by very different forms of life; for according
2009,to the length of time which has elapsed since the colonists entered one
2009,"of the regions, or both; according to the nature of the communication"
2009,"which allowed certain forms and not others to enter, either in greater"
2009,or lesser numbers; according or not as those which entered happened to
2009,come into more or less direct competition with each other and with the
2009,aborigines; and according as the immigrants were capable of varying
2009,"more or less rapidly, there would ensue in the to or more regions,"
2009,"independently of their physical conditions, infinitely diversified"
2009,conditions of life; there would be an almost endless amount of organic
2009,"action and reaction, and we should find some groups of beings greatly,"
2009,"and some only slightly modified; some developed in great force, some"
2009,existing in scanty numbers--and this we do find in the several great
2009,geographical provinces of the world.
2009,
2009,"On these same principles we can understand, as I have endeavoured to"
2009,"show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but that of"
2009,"these, a large proportion should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in"
2009,"relation to the means of migration, one group of beings should have all"
2009,"its species peculiar, and another group, even within the same class,"
2009,should have all its species the same with those in an adjoining quarter
2009,"of the world. We can see why whole groups of organisms, as batrachians"
2009,"and terrestrial mammals, should be absent from oceanic islands, whilst"
2009,the most isolated islands should possess their own peculiar species of
2009,"aerial mammals or bats. We can see why, in islands, there should be some"
2009,"relation between the presence of mammals, in a more or less modified"
2009,"condition, and the depth of the sea between such islands and the"
2009,"mainland. We can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago,"
2009,"though specifically distinct on the several islets, should be closely"
2009,"related to each other, and should likewise be related, but less closely,"
2009,"to those of the nearest continent, or other source whence immigrants"
2009,"might have been derived. We can see why, if there exist very closely"
2009,"allied or representative species in two areas, however distant from each"
2009,"other, some identical species will almost always there be found."
2009,
2009,"As the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking"
2009,parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space; the laws
2009,governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same
2009,with those governing at the present time the differences in different
2009,areas. We see this in many facts. The endurance of each species and
2009,group of species is continuous in time; for the apparent exceptions to
2009,the rule are so few that they may fairly be attributed to our not having
2009,as yet discovered in an intermediate deposit certain forms which are
2009,"absent in it, but which occur above and below: so in space, it certainly"
2009,"is the general rule that the area inhabited by a single species, or by a"
2009,"group of species, is continuous, and the exceptions, which are not rare,"
2009,"may, as I have attempted to show, be accounted for by former migrations"
2009,"under different circumstances, or through occasional means of transport,"
2009,or by the species having become extinct in the intermediate tracts. Both
2009,in time and space species and groups of species have their points of
2009,"maximum development. Groups of species, living during the same period"
2009,"of time, or living within the same area, are often characterised by"
2009,"trifling features in common, as of sculpture or colour. In looking to"
2009,"the long succession of past ages, as in looking to distant provinces"
2009,"throughout the world, we find that species in certain classes differ"
2009,"little from each other, whilst those in another class, or only in a"
2009,"different section of the same order, differ greatly from each other. In"
2009,both time and space the lowly organised members of each class generally
2009,change less than the highly organised; but there are in both cases
2009,"marked exceptions to the rule. According to our theory, these several"
2009,relations throughout time and space are intelligible; for whether we
2009,look to the allied forms of life which have changed during successive
2009,"ages, or to those which have changed after having migrated into distant"
2009,"quarters, in both cases they are connected by the same bond of ordinary"
2009,"generation; in both cases the laws of variation have been the same,"
2009,and modifications have been accumulated by the same means of natural
2009,selection.

2009,
2009,CLASSIFICATION.
2009,
2009,From the most remote period in the history of the world organic beings
2009,"have been found to resemble each other in descending degrees, so that"
2009,they can be classed in groups under groups. This classification is
2009,not arbitrary like the grouping of the stars in constellations. The
2009,"existence of groups would have been of simple significance, if one group"
2009,"had been exclusively fitted to inhabit the land, and another the water;"
2009,"one to feed on flesh, another on vegetable matter, and so on; but the"
2009,"case is widely different, for it is notorious how commonly members of"
2009,even the same subgroup have different habits. In the second and fourth
2009,"chapters, on Variation and on Natural Selection, I have attempted"
2009,"to show that within each country it is the widely ranging, the much"
2009,"diffused and common, that is the dominant species, belonging to"
2009,"the larger genera in each class, which vary most. The varieties, or"
2009,"incipient species, thus produced, ultimately become converted into new"
2009,"and distinct species; and these, on the principle of inheritance, tend"
2009,to produce other new and dominant species. Consequently the groups which
2009,"are now large, and which generally include many dominant species, tend"
2009,to go on increasing in size. I further attempted to show that from the
2009,varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as
2009,"different places as possible in the economy of nature, they constantly"
2009,tend to diverge in character. This latter conclusion is supported by
2009,"observing the great diversity of forms, which, in any small area, come"
2009,"into the closest competition, and by certain facts in naturalisation."
2009,
2009,I attempted also to show that there is a steady tendency in the forms
2009,"which are increasing in number and diverging in character, to supplant"
2009,"and exterminate the preceding, less divergent and less improved forms."
2009,"I request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action, as"
2009,"formerly explained, of these several principles; and he will see that"
2009,"the inevitable result is, that the modified descendants proceeding from"
2009,one progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups. In
2009,the diagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus
2009,including several species; and the whole of the genera along this upper
2009,"line form together one class, for all are descended from one ancient"
2009,"parent, and, consequently, have inherited something in common. But the"
2009,"three genera on the left hand have, on this same principle, much in"
2009,"common, and form a subfamily, distinct from that containing the next"
2009,"two genera on the right hand, which diverged from a common parent at"
2009,"the fifth stage of descent. These five genera have also much in common,"
2009,though less than when grouped in subfamilies; and they form a family
2009,distinct from that containing the three genera still further to the
2009,"right hand, which diverged at an earlier period. And all these genera,"
2009,"descended from (A), form an order distinct from the genera descended"
2009,from (I). So that we here have many species descended from a single
2009,"progenitor grouped into genera; and the genera into subfamilies,"
2009,"families and orders, all under one great class. The grand fact of the"
2009,"natural subordination of organic beings in groups under groups, which,"
2009,"from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in"
2009,"my judgment thus explained. No doubt organic beings, like all other"
2009,"objects, can be classed in many ways, either artificially by single"
2009,"characters, or more naturally by a number of characters. We know,"
2009,"for instance, that minerals and the elemental substances can be thus"
2009,arranged. In this case there is of course no relation to genealogical
2009,"succession, and no cause can at present be assigned for their falling"
2009,"into groups. But with organic beings the case is different, and the view"
2009,above given accords with their natural arrangement in group under group;
2009,and no other explanation has ever been attempted.
2009,
2009,"Naturalists, as we have seen, try to arrange the species, genera and"
2009,"families in each class, on what is called the Natural System. But what"
2009,is meant by this system? Some authors look at it merely as a scheme for
2009,"arranging together those living objects which are most alike, and for"
2009,separating those which are most unlike; or as an artificial method of
2009,"enunciating, as briefly as possible, general propositions--that is,"
2009,"by one sentence to give the characters common, for instance, to all"
2009,"mammals, by another those common to all carnivora, by another those"
2009,"common to the dog-genus, and then, by adding a single sentence, a full"
2009,description is given of each kind of dog. The ingenuity and utility of
2009,this system are indisputable. But many naturalists think that something
2009,more is meant by the Natural System; they believe that it reveals the
2009,plan of the Creator; but unless it be specified whether order in time
2009,"or space, or both, or what else is meant by the plan of the Creator,"
2009,it seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge. Expressions
2009,"such as that famous one by Linnaeus, which we often meet with in a more"
2009,"or less concealed form, namely, that the characters do not make the"
2009,"genus, but that the genus gives the characters, seem to imply that some"
2009,deeper bond is included in our classifications than mere resemblance.
2009,"I believe that this is the case, and that community of descent--the one"
2009,"known cause of close similarity in organic beings--is the bond, which,"
2009,"though observed by various degrees of modification, is partially"
2009,revealed to us by our classifications.
2009,
2009,"Let us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the"
2009,difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification
2009,"either gives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for"
2009,enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most
2009,like each other. It might have been thought (and was in ancient times
2009,thought) that those parts of the structure which determined the habits
2009,"of life, and the general place of each being in the economy of nature,"
2009,would be of very high importance in classification. Nothing can be more
2009,"false. No one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of"
2009,"a dugong to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any importance. These"
2009,"resemblances, though so intimately connected with the whole life of the"
2009,"being, are ranked as merely ""adaptive or analogical characters;"" but to"
2009,the consideration of these resemblances we shall recur. It may even be
2009,"given as a general rule, that the less any part of the organisation"
2009,"is concerned with special habits, the more important it becomes for"
2009,"classification. As an instance: Owen, in speaking of the dugong, says,"
2009,"""The generative organs, being those which are most remotely related to"
2009,"the habits and food of an animal, I have always regarded as affording"
2009,very clear indications of its true affinities. We are least likely in
2009,the modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an
2009,"essential character."" With plants how remarkable it is that the organs"
2009,"of vegetation, on which their nutrition and life depend, are of little"
2009,"signification; whereas the organs of reproduction, with their product"
2009,"the seed and embryo, are of paramount importance! So again, in formerly"
2009,discussing certain morphological characters which are not functionally
2009,"important, we have seen that they are often of the highest service in"
2009,classification. This depends on their constancy throughout many allied
2009,groups; and their constancy chiefly depends on any slight deviations not
2009,"having been preserved and accumulated by natural selection, which acts"
2009,only on serviceable characters.
2009,
2009,That the mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine
2009,"its classificatory value, is almost proved by the fact, that in allied"
2009,"groups, in which the same organ, as we have every reason to suppose, has"
2009,"nearly the same physiological value, its classificatory value is widely"
2009,different. No naturalist can have worked at any group without being
2009,struck with this fact; and it has been fully acknowledged in the
2009,writings of almost every author. It will suffice to quote the highest
2009,"authority, Robert Brown, who, in speaking of certain organs in the"
2009,"Proteaceae, says their generic importance, ""like that of all their"
2009,"parts, not only in this, but, as I apprehend in every natural family,"
2009,"is very unequal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost."" Again,"
2009,"in another work he says, the genera of the Connaraceae ""differ in having"
2009,"one or more ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the"
2009,imbricate or valvular aestivation. Any one of these characters singly is
2009,"frequently of more than generic importance, though here even, when"
2009,"all taken together, they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis from"
2009,"Connarus."" To give an example among insects: in one great division"
2009,"of the Hymenoptera, the antennae, as Westwood has remarked, are most"
2009,"constant in structure; in another division they differ much, and the"
2009,differences are of quite subordinate value in classification; yet no one
2009,will say that the antennae in these two divisions of the same order are
2009,of unequal physiological importance. Any number of instances could be
2009,given of the varying importance for classification of the same important
2009,organ within the same group of beings.
2009,
2009,"Again, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high"
2009,"physiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in this"
2009,condition are often of much value in classification. No one will dispute
2009,"that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants,"
2009,"and certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly serviceable in"
2009,exhibiting the close affinity between Ruminants and Pachyderms. Robert
2009,Brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the position of the
2009,rudimentary florets is of the highest importance in the classification
2009,of the Grasses.
2009,
2009,Numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which
2009,"must be considered of very trifling physiological importance, but which"
2009,are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of
2009,"whole groups. For instance, whether or not there is an open passage from"
2009,"the nostrils to the mouth, the only character, according to Owen, which"
2009,absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles--the inflection of the
2009,angle of the lower jaw in Marsupials--the manner in which the wings of
2009,insects are folded--mere colour in certain Algae--mere pubescence on
2009,"parts of the flower in grasses--the nature of the dermal covering, as"
2009,"hair or feathers, in the Vertebrata. If the Ornithorhynchus had been"
2009,"covered with feathers instead of hair, this external and trifling"
2009,character would have been considered by naturalists as an important aid
2009,in determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to birds.
2009,
2009,"The importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly"
2009,depends on their being correlated with many other characters of more or
2009,less importance. The value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very
2009,"evident in natural history. Hence, as has often been remarked, a"
2009,"species may depart from its allies in several characters, both of high"
2009,"physiological importance, and of almost universal prevalence, and yet"
2009,"leave us in no doubt where it should be ranked. Hence, also, it has been"
2009,"found that a classification founded on any single character,"
2009,"however important that may be, has always failed; for no part of the"
2009,organisation is invariably constant. The importance of an aggregate of
2009,"characters, even when none are important, alone explains the aphorism"
2009,"enunciated by Linnaeus, namely, that the characters do not give the"
2009,"genus, but the genus gives the character; for this seems founded on the"
2009,"appreciation of many trifling points of resemblance, too slight to be"
2009,"defined. Certain plants, belonging to the Malpighiaceae, bear perfect"
2009,"and degraded flowers; in the latter, as A. de Jussieu has remarked, ""The"
2009,"greater number of the characters proper to the species, to the genus,"
2009,"to the family, to the class, disappear, and thus laugh at our"
2009,"classification."" When Aspicarpa produced in France, during several"
2009,"years, only these degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a number"
2009,of the most important points of structure from the proper type of the
2009,"order, yet M. Richard sagaciously saw, as Jussieu observes, that this"
2009,genus should still be retained among the Malpighiaceae. This case well
2009,illustrates the spirit of our classifications.
2009,
2009,"Practically, when naturalists are at work, they do not trouble"
2009,themselves about the physiological value of the characters which they
2009,use in defining a group or in allocating any particular species. If they
2009,"find a character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of forms,"
2009,"and not common to others, they use it as one of high value; if common to"
2009,"some lesser number, they use it as of subordinate value. This principle"
2009,has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one; and
2009,"by none more clearly than by that excellent botanist, Aug. St. Hilaire."
2009,"If several trifling characters are always found in combination, though"
2009,"no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them, especial"
2009,"value is set on them. As in most groups of animals, important organs,"
2009,"such as those for propelling the blood, or for aerating it, or those for"
2009,"propagating the race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as"
2009,"highly serviceable in classification; but in some groups all these,"
2009,"the most important vital organs, are found to offer characters of quite"
2009,"subordinate value. Thus, as Fritz Muller has lately remarked, in the"
2009,"same group of crustaceans, Cypridina is furnished with a heart, while in"
2009,"two closely allied genera, namely Cypris and Cytherea, there is no such"
2009,"organ; one species of Cypridina has well-developed branchiae, while"
2009,another species is destitute of them.
2009,
2009,We can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of
2009,"equal importance with those derived from the adult, for a natural"
2009,classification of course includes all ages. But it is by no means
2009,"obvious, on the ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should"
2009,"be more important for this purpose than that of the adult, which alone"
2009,plays its full part in the economy of nature. Yet it has been strongly
2009,"urged by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards and Agassiz, that"
2009,embryological characters are the most important of all; and this
2009,"doctrine has very generally been admitted as true. Nevertheless,"
2009,"their importance has sometimes been exaggerated, owing to the adaptive"
2009,"characters of larvae not having been excluded; in order to show this,"
2009,"Fritz Muller arranged, by the aid of such characters alone, the great"
2009,"class of crustaceans, and the arrangement did not prove a natural one."
2009,"But there can be no doubt that embryonic, excluding larval characters,"
2009,"are of the highest value for classification, not only with animals but"
2009,with plants. Thus the main divisions of flowering plants are founded on
2009,"differences in the embryo--on the number and position of the cotyledons,"
2009,and on the mode of development of the plumule and radicle. We shall
2009,immediately see why these characters possess so high a value in
2009,"classification, namely, from the natural system being genealogical in"
2009,its arrangement.
2009,
2009,Our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of
2009,affinities. Nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters
2009,"common to all birds; but with crustaceans, any such definition has"
2009,hitherto been found impossible. There are crustaceans at the opposite
2009,"ends of the series, which have hardly a character in common; yet the"
2009,"species at both ends, from being plainly allied to others, and these to"
2009,"others, and so onwards, can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to"
2009,"this, and to no other class of the Articulata."
2009,
2009,"Geographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not quite"
2009,"logically, in classification, more especially in very large groups of"
2009,closely allied forms. Temminck insists on the utility or even necessity
2009,of this practice in certain groups of birds; and it has been followed by
2009,several entomologists and botanists.
2009,
2009,"Finally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of"
2009,"species, such as orders, suborders, families, subfamilies, and genera,"
2009,"they seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary. Several of the"
2009,"best botanists, such as Mr. Bentham and others, have strongly insisted"
2009,on their arbitrary value. Instances could be given among plants and
2009,"insects, of a group first ranked by practised naturalists as only a"
2009,"genus, and then raised to the rank of a subfamily or family; and this"
2009,"has been done, not because further research has detected important"
2009,"structural differences, at first overlooked, but because numerous"
2009,"allied species, with slightly different grades of difference, have been"
2009,subsequently discovered.
2009,
2009,All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification may
2009,"be explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that"
2009,the natural system is founded on descent with modification--that the
2009,characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between
2009,"any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from"
2009,"a common parent, all true classification being genealogical--that"
2009,community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been
2009,"unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the"
2009,"enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together and"
2009,separating objects more or less alike.
2009,
2009,But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe that the ARRANGEMENT
2009,"of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to"
2009,"each other, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but"
2009,"that the AMOUNT of difference in the several branches or groups, though"
2009,"allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may"
2009,"differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which"
2009,they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked
2009,"under different genera, families, sections or orders. The reader will"
2009,"best understand what is meant, if he will take the trouble to refer to"
2009,the diagram in the fourth chapter. We will suppose the letters A to L
2009,"to represent allied genera existing during the Silurian epoch, and"
2009,"descended from some still earlier form. In three of these genera (A,"
2009,"F, and I) a species has transmitted modified descendants to the present"
2009,"day, represented by the fifteen genera (a to z) on the uppermost"
2009,"horizontal line. Now, all these modified descendants from a single"
2009,species are related in blood or descent in the same degree. They may
2009,"metaphorically be called cousins to the same millionth degree, yet"
2009,they differ widely and in different degrees from each other. The forms
2009,"descended from A, now broken up into two or three families, constitute"
2009,"a distinct order from those descended from I, also broken up into two"
2009,families. Nor can the existing species descended from A be ranked in
2009,"the same genus with the parent A, or those from I with parent I. But the"
2009,"existing genus F may be supposed to have been but slightly modified,"
2009,and it will then rank with the parent genus F; just as some few still
2009,living organisms belong to Silurian genera. So that the comparative
2009,"value of the differences between these organic beings, which are all"
2009,"related to each other in the same degree in blood, has come to be widely"
2009,"different. Nevertheless, their genealogical ARRANGEMENT remains strictly"
2009,"true, not only at the present time, but at each successive period"
2009,of descent. All the modified descendants from A will have inherited
2009,"something in common from their common parent, as will all the"
2009,descendants from I; so will it be with each subordinate branch of
2009,"descendants at each successive stage. If, however, we suppose any"
2009,descendant of A or of I to have become so much modified as to have
2009,"lost all traces of its parentage in this case, its place in the natural"
2009,"system will be lost, as seems to have occurred with some few existing"
2009,"organisms. All the descendants of the genus F, along its whole line of"
2009,"descent, are supposed to have been but little modified, and they form"
2009,"a single genus. But this genus, though much isolated, will still occupy"
2009,its proper intermediate position. The representation of the groups as
2009,"here given in the diagram on a flat surface, is much too simple. The"
2009,branches ought to have diverged in all directions. If the names of
2009,the groups had been simply written down in a linear series the
2009,representation would have been still less natural; and it is notoriously
2009,"not possible to represent in a series, on a flat surface, the affinities"
2009,"which we discover in nature among the beings of the same group. Thus,"
2009,"the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a pedigree."
2009,But the amount of modification which the different groups have undergone
2009,"has to be expressed by ranking them under different so-called genera,"
2009,"subfamilies, families, sections, orders, and classes."
2009,
2009,"It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by"
2009,taking the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of
2009,"mankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the"
2009,best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the
2009,"world; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly"
2009,"changing dialects, were to be included, such an arrangement would be"
2009,the only possible one. Yet it might be that some ancient languages had
2009,"altered very little and had given rise to few new languages, whilst"
2009,"others had altered much owing to the spreading, isolation and state of"
2009,"civilisation of the several co-descended races, and had thus given rise"
2009,to many new dialects and languages. The various degrees of difference
2009,between the languages of the same stock would have to be expressed by
2009,groups subordinate to groups; but the proper or even the only possible
2009,arrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly
2009,"natural, as it would connect together all languages, extinct and recent,"
2009,"by the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and origin of"
2009,each tongue.
2009,
2009,"In confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification of"
2009,"varieties, which are known or believed to be descended from a single"
2009,"species. These are grouped under the species, with the subvarieties"
2009,"under the varieties; and in some cases, as with the domestic pigeon,"
2009,with several other grades of difference. Nearly the same rules are
2009,followed as in classifying species. Authors have insisted on the
2009,necessity of arranging varieties on a natural instead of an artificial
2009,"system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of"
2009,"the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most"
2009,"important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the Swedish"
2009,"and common turnip together, though the esculent and thickened stems"
2009,"are so similar. Whatever part is found to be most constant, is used in"
2009,classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns
2009,"are very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less"
2009,"variable than the shape or colour of the body, etc.; whereas with sheep"
2009,"the horns are much less serviceable, because less constant. In classing"
2009,"varieties, I apprehend that if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical"
2009,classification would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted
2009,"in some cases. For we might feel sure, whether there had been more or"
2009,"less modification, that the principle of inheritance would keep the"
2009,forms together which were allied in the greatest number of points. In
2009,"tumbler pigeons, though some of the subvarieties differ in the important"
2009,"character of the length of the beak, yet all are kept together from"
2009,having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has
2009,"nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any thought on"
2009,"the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied"
2009,in blood and alike in some other respects.
2009,
2009,"With species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought"
2009,"descent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade,"
2009,"that of species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes"
2009,differ in the most important characters is known to every naturalist:
2009,scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the adult males
2009,"and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, and yet no one dreams of"
2009,"separating them. As soon as the three Orchidean forms, Monachanthus,"
2009,"Myanthus, and Catasetum, which had previously been ranked as three"
2009,"distinct genera, were known to be sometimes produced on the same plant,"
2009,they were immediately considered as varieties; and now I have been able
2009,"to show that they are the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of the"
2009,same species. The naturalist includes as one species the various larval
2009,"stages of the same individual, however much they may differ from each"
2009,other and from the adult; as well as the so-called alternate generations
2009,"of Steenstrup, which can only in a technical sense be considered as"
2009,"the same individual. He includes monsters and varieties, not from their"
2009,"partial resemblance to the parent-form, but because they are descended"
2009,from it.
2009,
2009,As descent has universally been used in classing together the
2009,"individuals of the same species, though the males and females and larvae"
2009,are sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used in classing
2009,"varieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable"
2009,"amount of modification, may not this same element of descent have been"
2009,"unconsciously used in grouping species under genera, and genera under"
2009,"higher groups, all under the so-called natural system? I believe it"
2009,has been unconsciously used; and thus only can I understand the several
2009,rules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists.
2009,"As we have no written pedigrees, we are forced to trace community"
2009,"of descent by resemblances of any kind. Therefore, we choose those"
2009,"characters which are the least likely to have been modified, in relation"
2009,to the conditions of life to which each species has been recently
2009,"exposed. Rudimentary structures on this view are as good as, or even"
2009,sometimes better than other parts of the organisation. We care not how
2009,trifling a character may be--let it be the mere inflection of the angle
2009,"of the jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded, whether the"
2009,skin be covered by hair or feathers--if it prevail throughout many and
2009,"different species, especially those having very different habits of"
2009,"life, it assumes high value; for we can account for its presence in so"
2009,"many forms with such different habits, only by inheritance from a"
2009,common parent. We may err in this respect in regard to single points of
2009,"structure, but when several characters, let them be ever so trifling,"
2009,"concur throughout a large group of beings having different habits, we"
2009,"may feel almost sure, on the theory of descent, that these characters"
2009,have been inherited from a common ancestor; and we know that such
2009,aggregated characters have especial value in classification.
2009,
2009,We can understand why a species or a group of species may depart from
2009,"its allies, in several of its most important characteristics, and yet be"
2009,"safely classed with them. This may be safely done, and is often done,"
2009,"as long as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so"
2009,"unimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of descent. Let two"
2009,"forms have not a single character in common, yet, if these extreme forms"
2009,"are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at"
2009,"once infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the same"
2009,class. As we find organs of high physiological importance--those
2009,which serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of
2009,"existence--are generally the most constant, we attach especial value to"
2009,"them; but if these same organs, in another group or section of a"
2009,"group, are found to differ much, we at once value them less in our"
2009,classification. We shall presently see why embryological characters are
2009,of such high classificatory importance. Geographical distribution
2009,"may sometimes be brought usefully into play in classing large genera,"
2009,"because all the species of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and"
2009,"isolated region, are in all probability descended from the same parents."
2009,
2009,ANALOGICAL RESEMBLANCES.
2009,
2009,"We can understand, on the above views, the very important distinction"
2009,between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances. Lamarck
2009,"first called attention to this subject, and he has been ably followed by"
2009,Macleay and others. The resemblance in the shape of the body and in the
2009,"fin-like anterior limbs between dugongs and whales, and between these"
2009,"two orders of mammals and fishes, are analogical. So is the resemblance"
2009,"between a mouse and a shrew-mouse (Sorex), which belong to different"
2009,"orders; and the still closer resemblance, insisted on by Mr. Mivart,"
2009,between the mouse and a small marsupial animal (Antechinus) of
2009,"Australia. These latter resemblances may be accounted for, as it seems"
2009,"to me, by adaptation for similarly active movements through thickets and"
2009,"herbage, together with concealment from enemies."
2009,
2009,"Among insects there are innumerable instances; thus Linnaeus, misled by"
2009,"external appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth."
2009,"We see something of the same kind even with our domestic varieties, as"
2009,in the strikingly similar shape of the body in the improved breeds of
2009,"the Chinese and common pig, which are descended from distinct species;"
2009,and in the similarly thickened stems of the common and specifically
2009,distinct Swedish turnip. The resemblance between the greyhound and
2009,race-horse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been
2009,drawn by some authors between widely different animals.
2009,
2009,"On the view of characters being of real importance for classification,"
2009,"only in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly understand why"
2009,"analogical or adaptive characters, although of the utmost importance to"
2009,"the welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the systematist."
2009,"For animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent, may have"
2009,"become adapted to similar conditions, and thus have assumed a close"
2009,external resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal--will rather
2009,tend to conceal their blood-relationship. We can thus also understand
2009,"the apparent paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when"
2009,"one group is compared with another, but give true affinities when the"
2009,members of the same group are compared together: thus the shape of the
2009,body and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared
2009,"with fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through"
2009,"the water; but between the the several members of the whale family, the"
2009,shape of the body and the fin-like limbs offer characters exhibiting
2009,true affinity; for as these parts are so nearly similar throughout
2009,"the whole family, we cannot doubt that they have been inherited from a"
2009,common ancestor. So it is with fishes.
2009,
2009,Numerous cases could be given of striking resemblances in quite distinct
2009,"beings between single parts or organs, which have been adapted for the"
2009,same functions. A good instance is afforded by the close resemblance of
2009,the jaws of the dog and Tasmanian wolf or Thylacinus--animals which are
2009,widely sundered in the natural system. But this resemblance is confined
2009,"to general appearance, as in the prominence of the canines, and in the"
2009,cutting shape of the molar teeth. For the teeth really differ much: thus
2009,the dog has on each side of the upper jaw four pre-molars and only two
2009,molars; while the Thylacinus has three pre-molars and four molars.
2009,The molars also differ much in the two animals in relative size and
2009,structure. The adult dentition is preceded by a widely different milk
2009,"dentition. Any one may, of course, deny that the teeth in either case"
2009,"have been adapted for tearing flesh, through the natural selection of"
2009,"successive variations; but if this be admitted in the one case, it is"
2009,unintelligible to me that it should be denied in the other. I am glad to
2009,find that so high an authority as Professor Flower has come to this same
2009,conclusion.
2009,
2009,"The extraordinary cases given in a former chapter, of widely different"
2009,fishes possessing electric organs--of widely different insects
2009,possessing luminous organs--and of orchids and asclepiads having
2009,"pollen-masses with viscid discs, come under this same head of analogical"
2009,resemblances. But these cases are so wonderful that they were introduced
2009,as difficulties or objections to our theory. In all such cases some
2009,"fundamental difference in the growth or development of the parts, and"
2009,"generally in their matured structure, can be detected. The end gained is"
2009,"the same, but the means, though appearing superficially to be the same,"
2009,are essentially different. The principle formerly alluded to under the
2009,term of ANALOGICAL VARIATION has probably in these cases often come into
2009,"play; that is, the members of the same class, although only distantly"
2009,"allied, have inherited so much in common in their constitution, that"
2009,they are apt to vary under similar exciting causes in a similar
2009,manner; and this would obviously aid in the acquirement through natural
2009,"selection of parts or organs, strikingly like each other, independently"
2009,of their direct inheritance from a common progenitor.
2009,
2009,As species belonging to distinct classes have often been adapted
2009,by successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar
2009,"circumstances--to inhabit, for instance, the three elements of land,"
2009,air and water--we can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical
2009,parallelism has sometimes been observed between the subgroups of
2009,"distinct classes. A naturalist, struck with a parallelism of this"
2009,"nature, by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in"
2009,several classes (and all our experience shows that their valuation is as
2009,"yet arbitrary), could easily extend the parallelism over a wide range;"
2009,"and thus the septenary, quinary, quaternary and ternary classifications"
2009,have probably arisen.
2009,
2009,There is another and curious class of cases in which close external
2009,"resemblance does not depend on adaptation to similar habits of life, but"
2009,has been gained for the sake of protection. I allude to the wonderful
2009,"manner in which certain butterflies imitate, as first described by Mr."
2009,"Bates, other and quite distinct species. This excellent observer has"
2009,"shown that in some districts of South America, where, for instance, an"
2009,"Ithomia abounds in gaudy swarms, another butterfly, namely, a Leptalis,"
2009,is often found mingled in the same flock; and the latter so closely
2009,"resembles the Ithomia in every shade and stripe of colour, and even"
2009,"in the shape of its wings, that Mr. Bates, with his eyes sharpened"
2009,"by collecting during eleven years, was, though always on his guard,"
2009,continually deceived. When the mockers and the mocked are caught and
2009,"compared, they are found to be very different in essential structure,"
2009,"and to belong not only to distinct genera, but often to distinct"
2009,"families. Had this mimicry occurred in only one or two instances, it"
2009,"might have been passed over as a strange coincidence. But, if we proceed"
2009,"from a district where one Leptalis imitates an Ithomia, another mocking"
2009,"and mocked species, belonging to the same two genera, equally close in"
2009,"their resemblance, may be found. Altogether no less than ten genera are"
2009,"enumerated, which include species that imitate other butterflies. The"
2009,mockers and mocked always inhabit the same region; we never find an
2009,imitator living remote from the form which it imitates. The mockers are
2009,almost invariably rare insects; the mocked in almost every case abounds
2009,in swarms. In the same district in which a species of Leptalis closely
2009,"imitates an Ithomia, there are sometimes other Lepidoptera mimicking"
2009,"the same Ithomia: so that in the same place, species of three genera of"
2009,butterflies and even a moth are found all closely resembling a butterfly
2009,belonging to a fourth genus. It deserves especial notice that many of
2009,"the mimicking forms of the Leptalis, as well as of the mimicked forms,"
2009,can be shown by a graduated series to be merely varieties of the same
2009,"species; while others are undoubtedly distinct species. But why, it may"
2009,"be asked, are certain forms treated as the mimicked and others as the"
2009,mimickers? Mr. Bates satisfactorily answers this question by showing
2009,that the form which is imitated keeps the usual dress of the group to
2009,"which it belongs, while the counterfeiters have changed their dress and"
2009,do not resemble their nearest allies.
2009,
2009,We are next led to enquire what reason can be assigned for certain
2009,butterflies and moths so often assuming the dress of another and
2009,"quite distinct form; why, to the perplexity of naturalists, has nature"
2009,"condescended to the tricks of the stage? Mr. Bates has, no doubt, hit on"
2009,"the true explanation. The mocked forms, which always abound in numbers,"
2009,"must habitually escape destruction to a large extent, otherwise they"
2009,could not exist in such swarms; and a large amount of evidence has now
2009,"been collected, showing that they are distasteful to birds and other"
2009,"insect-devouring animals. The mocking forms, on the other hand, that"
2009,"inhabit the same district, are comparatively rare, and belong to"
2009,"rare groups; hence, they must suffer habitually from some danger, for"
2009,"otherwise, from the number of eggs laid by all butterflies, they would"
2009,in three or four generations swarm over the whole country. Now if a
2009,member of one of these persecuted and rare groups were to assume a dress
2009,so like that of a well-protected species that it continually deceived
2009,"the practised eyes of an entomologist, it would often deceive predaceous"
2009,"birds and insects, and thus often escape destruction. Mr. Bates may"
2009,almost be said to have actually witnessed the process by which the
2009,mimickers have come so closely to resemble the mimicked; for he
2009,found that some of the forms of Leptalis which mimic so many other
2009,"butterflies, varied in an extreme degree. In one district several"
2009,"varieties occurred, and of these one alone resembled, to a certain"
2009,"extent, the common Ithomia of the same district. In another district"
2009,"there were two or three varieties, one of which was much commoner than"
2009,"the others, and this closely mocked another form of Ithomia. From facts"
2009,"of this nature, Mr. Bates concludes that the Leptalis first varies; and"
2009,when a variety happens to resemble in some degree any common butterfly
2009,"inhabiting the same district, this variety, from its resemblance to a"
2009,"flourishing and little persecuted kind, has a better chance of escaping"
2009,"destruction from predaceous birds and insects, and is consequently"
2009,"oftener preserved; ""the less perfect degrees of resemblance being"
2009,"generation after generation eliminated, and only the others left to"
2009,"propagate their kind."" So that here we have an excellent illustration of"
2009,natural selection.
2009,
2009,Messrs. Wallace and Trimen have likewise described several equally
2009,striking cases of imitation in the Lepidoptera of the Malay Archipelago
2009,"and Africa, and with some other insects. Mr. Wallace has also detected"
2009,"one such case with birds, but we have none with the larger quadrupeds."
2009,The much greater frequency of imitation with insects than with other
2009,"animals, is probably the consequence of their small size; insects cannot"
2009,"defend themselves, excepting indeed the kinds furnished with a sting,"
2009,and I have never heard of an instance of such kinds mocking other
2009,"insects, though they are mocked; insects cannot easily escape by"
2009,"flight from the larger animals which prey on them; therefore, speaking"
2009,"metaphorically, they are reduced, like most weak creatures, to trickery"
2009,and dissimulation.
2009,
2009,It should be observed that the process of imitation probably never
2009,"commenced between forms widely dissimilar in colour. But, starting with"
2009,"species already somewhat like each other, the closest resemblance,"
2009,"if beneficial, could readily be gained by the above means, and if"
2009,the imitated form was subsequently and gradually modified through any
2009,"agency, the imitating form would be led along the same track, and thus"
2009,"be altered to almost any extent, so that it might ultimately assume an"
2009,appearance or colouring wholly unlike that of the other members of the
2009,"family to which it belonged. There is, however, some difficulty on this"
2009,"head, for it is necessary to suppose in some cases that ancient members"
2009,"belonging to several distinct groups, before they had diverged to their"
2009,"present extent, accidentally resembled a member of another and protected"
2009,"group in a sufficient degree to afford some slight protection, this"
2009,having given the basis for the subsequent acquisition of the most
2009,perfect resemblance.
2009,
2009,ON THE NATURE OF THE AFFINITIES CONNECTING ORGANIC BEINGS.
2009,
2009,"As the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger"
2009,"genera, tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to which"
2009,"they belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to"
2009,"spread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy of"
2009,nature. The larger and more dominant groups within each class thus tend
2009,"to go on increasing in size, and they consequently supplant many"
2009,"smaller and feebler groups. Thus, we can account for the fact that all"
2009,"organisms, recent and extinct, are included under a few great orders and"
2009,under still fewer classes. As showing how few the higher groups are in
2009,"number, and how widely they are spread throughout the world, the fact"
2009,is striking that the discovery of Australia has not added an insect
2009,"belonging to a new class, and that in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn"
2009,"from Dr. Hooker, it has added only two or three families of small size."
2009,
2009,"In the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the"
2009,principle of each group having generally diverged much in character
2009,"during the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the"
2009,more ancient forms of life often present characters in some degree
2009,intermediate between existing groups. As some few of the old and
2009,intermediate forms having transmitted to the present day descendants
2009,"but little modified, these constitute our so-called osculant or aberrant"
2009,"groups. The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be the number of"
2009,connecting forms which have been exterminated and utterly lost. And
2009,we have evidence of aberrant groups having suffered severely from
2009,"extinction, for they are almost always represented by extremely few"
2009,species; and such species as do occur are generally very distinct from
2009,"each other, which again implies extinction. The genera Ornithorhynchus"
2009,"and Lepidosiren, for example, would not have been less aberrant had"
2009,"each been represented by a dozen species, instead of as at present by a"
2009,"single one, or by two or three. We can, I think, account for this fact"
2009,only by looking at aberrant groups as forms which have been conquered
2009,"by more successful competitors, with a few members still preserved under"
2009,unusually favourable conditions.
2009,
2009,Mr. Waterhouse has remarked that when a member belonging to one group of
2009,"animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this affinity"
2009,"in most cases is general and not special: thus, according to Mr."
2009,"Waterhouse, of all Rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to"
2009,"Marsupials; but in the points in which it approaches this order, its"
2009,"relations are general, that is, not to any one Marsupial species more"
2009,than to another. As these points of affinity are believed to be real
2009,"and not merely adaptive, they must be due in accordance with our view to"
2009,"inheritance from a common progenitor. Therefore, we must suppose either"
2009,"that all Rodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some ancient"
2009,"Marsupial, which will naturally have been more or less intermediate in"
2009,character with respect to all existing Marsupials; or that both Rodents
2009,"and Marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that both"
2009,groups have since undergone much modification in divergent directions.
2009,"On either view we must suppose that the bizcacha has retained, by"
2009,"inheritance, more of the character of its ancient progenitor than have"
2009,other Rodents; and therefore it will not be specially related to any one
2009,"existing Marsupial, but indirectly to all or nearly all Marsupials, from"
2009,"having partially retained the character of their common progenitor, or"
2009,"of some early member of the group. On the other hand, of all Marsupials,"
2009,"as Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the Phascolomys resembles most nearly,"
2009,"not any one species, but the general order of Rodents. In this case,"
2009,"however, it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only"
2009,"analogical, owing to the Phascolomys having become adapted to habits"
2009,like those of a Rodent. The elder De Candolle has made nearly similar
2009,observations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct
2009,families of plants.
2009,
2009,On the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in
2009,"character of the species descended from a common progenitor, together"
2009,"with their retention by inheritance of some characters in common, we can"
2009,understand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all
2009,the members of the same family or higher group are connected together.
2009,"For the common progenitor of a whole family, now broken up by extinction"
2009,"into distinct groups and subgroups, will have transmitted some of its"
2009,"characters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all the species;"
2009,and they will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines
2009,of affinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the diagram so often
2009,"referred to), mounting up through many predecessors. As it is difficult"
2009,to show the blood-relationship between the numerous kindred of any
2009,"ancient and noble family, even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and"
2009,"almost impossible to do so without this aid, we can understand"
2009,the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in
2009,"describing, without the aid of a diagram, the various affinities which"
2009,they perceive between the many living and extinct members of the same
2009,great natural class.
2009,
2009,"Extinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an"
2009,important part in defining and widening the intervals between the
2009,several groups in each class. We may thus account for the distinctness
2009,"of whole classes from each other--for instance, of birds from all other"
2009,vertebrate animals--by the belief that many ancient forms of life have
2009,"been utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of birds were"
2009,formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other and at that
2009,time less differentiated vertebrate classes. There has been much
2009,less extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes with
2009,"Batrachians. There has been still less within some whole classes, for"
2009,"instance the Crustacea, for here the most wonderfully diverse forms"
2009,are still linked together by a long and only partially broken chain of
2009,affinities. Extinction has only defined the groups: it has by no means
2009,made them; for if every form which has ever lived on this earth were
2009,"suddenly to reappear, though it would be quite impossible to give"
2009,"definitions by which each group could be distinguished, still a natural"
2009,"classification, or at least a natural arrangement, would be possible."
2009,"We shall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters, A to L, may"
2009,"represent eleven Silurian genera, some of which have produced large"
2009,"groups of modified descendants, with every link in each branch and"
2009,sub-branch still alive; and the links not greater than those between
2009,existing varieties. In this case it would be quite impossible to give
2009,definitions by which the several members of the several groups could be
2009,distinguished from their more immediate parents and descendants. Yet the
2009,arrangement in the diagram would still hold good and would be natural;
2009,"for, on the principle of inheritance, all the forms descended, for"
2009,"instance from A, would have something in common. In a tree we can"
2009,"distinguish this or that branch, though at the actual fork the two unite"
2009,"and blend together. We could not, as I have said, define the several"
2009,"groups; but we could pick out types, or forms, representing most of"
2009,"the characters of each group, whether large or small, and thus give a"
2009,general idea of the value of the differences between them. This is what
2009,"we should be driven to, if we were ever to succeed in collecting all the"
2009,forms in any one class which have lived throughout all time and space.
2009,Assuredly we shall never succeed in making so perfect a collection:
2009,"nevertheless, in certain classes, we are tending toward this end;"
2009,"and Milne Edwards has lately insisted, in an able paper, on the high"
2009,"importance of looking to types, whether or not we can separate and"
2009,define the groups to which such types belong.
2009,
2009,"Finally, we have seen that natural selection, which follows from the"
2009,"struggle for existence, and which almost inevitably leads to"
2009,extinction and divergence of character in the descendants from any
2009,"one parent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the"
2009,"affinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group"
2009,under group. We use the element of descent in classing the individuals
2009,"of both sexes and of all ages under one species, although they may have"
2009,but few characters in common; we use descent in classing acknowledged
2009,"varieties, however different they may be from their parents; and I"
2009,believe that this element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion
2009,which naturalists have sought under the term of the Natural System.
2009,"On this idea of the natural system being, in so far as it has been"
2009,"perfected, genealogical in its arrangement, with the grades of"
2009,"difference expressed by the terms genera, families, orders, etc., we"
2009,can understand the rules which we are compelled to follow in our
2009,classification. We can understand why we value certain resemblances far
2009,"more than others; why we use rudimentary and useless organs, or others"
2009,"of trifling physiological importance; why, in finding the relations"
2009,"between one group and another, we summarily reject analogical or"
2009,"adaptive characters, and yet use these same characters within the limits"
2009,of the same group. We can clearly see how it is that all living and
2009,extinct forms can be grouped together within a few great classes; and
2009,how the several members of each class are connected together by the most
2009,"complex and radiating lines of affinities. We shall never, probably,"
2009,disentangle the inextricable web of the affinities between the members
2009,"of any one class; but when we have a distinct object in view, and do not"
2009,"look to some unknown plan of creation, we may hope to make sure but slow"
2009,progress.
2009,
2009,"Professor Haeckel in his ""Generelle Morphologie"" and in another works,"
2009,has recently brought his great knowledge and abilities to bear on what
2009,"he calls phylogeny, or the lines of descent of all organic beings."
2009,In drawing up the several series he trusts chiefly to embryological
2009,"characters, but receives aid from homologous and rudimentary organs, as"
2009,well as from the successive periods at which the various forms of life
2009,are believed to have first appeared in our geological formations. He has
2009,"thus boldly made a great beginning, and shows us how classification will"
2009,in the future be treated.
2009,
2009,MORPHOLOGY.
2009,
2009,"We have seen that the members of the same class, independently of"
2009,"their habits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of their"
2009,"organisation. This resemblance is often expressed by the term ""unity of"
2009,"type;"" or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different"
2009,species of the class are homologous. The whole subject is included under
2009,the general term of Morphology. This is one of the most interesting
2009,"departments of natural history, and may almost be said to be its very"
2009,"soul. What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for"
2009,"grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle"
2009,"of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on"
2009,"the same pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative"
2009,"positions? How curious it is, to give a subordinate though striking"
2009,"instance, that the hind feet of the kangaroo, which are so well fitted"
2009,"for bounding over the open plains--those of the climbing, leaf-eating"
2009,"koala, equally well fitted for grasping the branches of trees--those"
2009,"of the ground-dwelling, insect or root-eating, bandicoots--and those of"
2009,some other Australian marsupials--should all be constructed on the same
2009,"extraordinary type, namely with the bones of the second and third digits"
2009,"extremely slender and enveloped within the same skin, so that they"
2009,appear like a single toe furnished with two claws. Notwithstanding this
2009,"similarity of pattern, it is obvious that the hind feet of these several"
2009,animals are used for as widely different purposes as it is possible to
2009,conceive. The case is rendered all the more striking by the American
2009,"opossums, which follow nearly the same habits of life as some of their"
2009,"Australian relatives, having feet constructed on the ordinary plan."
2009,"Professor Flower, from whom these statements are taken, remarks in"
2009,"conclusion: ""We may call this conformity to type, without getting much"
2009,"nearer to an explanation of the phenomenon;"" and he then adds ""but is"
2009,"it not powerfully suggestive of true relationship, of inheritance from a"
2009,"common ancestor?"""
2009,
2009,Geoffroy St. Hilaire has strongly insisted on the high importance of
2009,relative position or connexion in homologous parts; they may differ to
2009,"almost any extent in form and size, and yet remain connected together in"
2009,"the same invariable order. We never find, for instance, the bones of"
2009,"the arm and forearm, or of the thigh and leg, transposed. Hence the same"
2009,names can be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals.
2009,We see the same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects:
2009,what can be more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a
2009,"sphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws"
2009,"of a beetle? Yet all these organs, serving for such widely different"
2009,"purposes, are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper"
2009,"lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. The same law governs the"
2009,construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans. So it is with the
2009,flowers of plants.
2009,
2009,Nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity
2009,"of pattern in members of the same class, by utility or by the doctrine"
2009,of final causes. The hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly
2009,"admitted by Owen in his most interesting work on the ""Nature of Limbs."""
2009,"On the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can"
2009,only say that so it is; that it has pleased the Creator to construct all
2009,the animals and plants in each great class on a uniform plan; but this
2009,is not a scientific explanation.
2009,
2009,"The explanation is to a large extent simple, on the theory of the"
2009,"selection of successive slight modifications, each being profitable in"
2009,"some way to the modified form, but often affecting by correlation other"
2009,"parts of the organisation. In changes of this nature, there will be"
2009,"little or no tendency to alter the original pattern, or to transpose"
2009,the parts. The bones of a limb might be shortened and flattened to any
2009,"extent, becoming at the same time enveloped in thick membrane, so as to"
2009,"serve as a fin; or a webbed hand might have all its bones, or certain"
2009,"bones, lengthened to any extent, with the membrane connecting them"
2009,"increased, so as to serve as a wing; yet all these modifications would"
2009,not tend to alter the framework of the bones or the relative connexion
2009,"of the parts. If we suppose that an early progenitor--the archetype,"
2009,"as it may be called--of all mammals, birds and reptiles, had its limbs"
2009,"constructed on the existing general pattern, for whatever purpose"
2009,"they served, we can at once perceive the plain signification of the"
2009,homologous construction of the limbs throughout the class. So with the
2009,"mouths of insects, we have only to suppose that their common progenitor"
2009,"had an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae, these parts"
2009,being perhaps very simple in form; and then natural selection will
2009,account for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the
2009,"mouths of insects. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general"
2009,"pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally lost,"
2009,by the reduction and ultimately by the complete abortion of
2009,"certain parts, by the fusion of other parts, and by the doubling or"
2009,"multiplication of others, variations which we know to be within"
2009,the limits of possibility. In the paddles of the gigantic extinct
2009,"sea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans, the"
2009,general pattern seems thus to have become partially obscured.
2009,
2009,"There is another and equally curious branch of our subject; namely,"
2009,"serial homologies, or the comparison of the different parts or organs"
2009,"in the same individual, and not of the same parts or organs in different"
2009,members of the same class. Most physiologists believe that the bones of
2009,"the skull are homologous--that is, correspond in number and in relative"
2009,connexion--with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae.
2009,The anterior and posterior limbs in all the higher vertebrate classes
2009,are plainly homologous. So it is with the wonderfully complex jaws
2009,"and legs of crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in"
2009,"a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and"
2009,"pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible on the"
2009,"view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In"
2009,"monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one"
2009,"organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see, during"
2009,"the early or embryonic stages of development in flowers, as well as"
2009,"in crustaceans and many other animals, that organs, which when mature"
2009,become extremely different are at first exactly alike.
2009,
2009,How inexplicable are the cases of serial homologies on the ordinary view
2009,of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of
2009,such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone apparently
2009,"representing vertebrae? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived"
2009,from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition by
2009,"mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of"
2009,birds and reptiles. Why should similar bones have been created to
2009,"form the wing and the leg of a bat, used as they are for such"
2009,"totally different purposes, namely flying and walking? Why should one"
2009,"crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts,"
2009,"consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many"
2009,"legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and"
2009,"pistils, in each flower, though fitted for such distinct purposes, be"
2009,all constructed on the same pattern?
2009,
2009,"On the theory of natural selection, we can, to a certain extent, answer"
2009,these questions. We need not here consider how the bodies of some
2009,"animals first became divided into a series of segments, or how they"
2009,"became divided into right and left sides, with corresponding organs, for"
2009,"such questions are almost beyond investigation. It is, however, probable"
2009,that some serial structures are the result of cells multiplying by
2009,"division, entailing the multiplication of the parts developed from"
2009,such cells. It must suffice for our purpose to bear in mind that
2009,an indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common
2009,"characteristic, as Owen has remarked, of all low or little specialised"
2009,forms; therefore the unknown progenitor of the Vertebrata probably
2009,"possessed many vertebrae; the unknown progenitor of the Articulata, many"
2009,"segments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants, many leaves"
2009,arranged in one or more spires. We have also formerly seen that parts
2009,"many times repeated are eminently liable to vary, not only in number,"
2009,"but in form. Consequently such parts, being already present in"
2009,"considerable numbers, and being highly variable, would naturally afford"
2009,the materials for adaptation to the most different purposes; yet they
2009,"would generally retain, through the force of inheritance, plain traces"
2009,of their original or fundamental resemblance. They would retain this
2009,"resemblance all the more, as the variations, which afforded the basis"
2009,"for their subsequent modification through natural selection, would"
2009,tend from the first to be similar; the parts being at an early stage of
2009,"growth alike, and being subjected to nearly the same conditions. Such"
2009,"parts, whether more or less modified, unless their common origin became"
2009,"wholly obscured, would be serially homologous."
2009,
2009,"In the great class of molluscs, though the parts in distinct species"
2009,"can be shown to be homologous, only a few serial homologies; such as the"
2009,"valves of Chitons, can be indicated; that is, we are seldom enabled"
2009,to say that one part is homologous with another part in the same
2009,"individual. And we can understand this fact; for in molluscs, even"
2009,"in the lowest members of the class, we do not find nearly so much"
2009,indefinite repetition of any one part as we find in the other great
2009,classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
2009,
2009,"But morphology is a much more complex subject than it at first appears,"
2009,as has lately been well shown in a remarkable paper by Mr. E. Ray
2009,"Lankester, who has drawn an important distinction between certain"
2009,classes of cases which have all been equally ranked by naturalists as
2009,homologous. He proposes to call the structures which resemble each other
2009,"in distinct animals, owing to their descent from a common progenitor"
2009,"with subsequent modification, ""homogenous""; and the resemblances which"
2009,"cannot thus be accounted for, he proposes to call ""homoplastic"". For"
2009,"instance, he believes that the hearts of birds and mammals are as a"
2009,"whole homogenous--that is, have been derived from a common progenitor;"
2009,but that the four cavities of the heart in the two classes are
2009,"homoplastic--that is, have been independently developed. Mr. Lankester"
2009,also adduces the close resemblance of the parts on the right and left
2009,"sides of the body, and in the successive segments of the same individual"
2009,animal; and here we have parts commonly called homologous which bear no
2009,relation to the descent of distinct species from a common progenitor.
2009,"Homoplastic structures are the same with those which I have classed,"
2009,"though in a very imperfect manner, as analogous modifications or"
2009,resemblances. Their formation may be attributed in part to distinct
2009,"organisms, or to distinct parts of the same organism, having varied in"
2009,"an analogous manner; and in part to similar modifications, having"
2009,"been preserved for the same general purpose or function, of which many"
2009,instances have been given.
2009,
2009,Naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed
2009,vertebrae; the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and
2009,pistils in flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in most cases
2009,"be more correct, as Professor Huxley has remarked, to speak of both"
2009,"skull and vertebrae, jaws and legs, etc., as having been metamorphosed,"
2009,"not one from the other, as they now exist, but from some common and"
2009,"simpler element. Most naturalists, however, use such language only in a"
2009,metaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that during a long course
2009,"of descent, primordial organs of any kind--vertebrae in the one case and"
2009,legs in the other--have actually been converted into skulls or jaws. Yet
2009,so strong is the appearance of this having occurred that naturalists
2009,can hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification.
2009,"According to the views here maintained, such language may be used"
2009,"literally; and the wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab"
2009,"retaining numerous characters, which they probably would have retained"
2009,"through inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed from true"
2009,"though extremely simple legs, is in part explained."
2009,
2009,DEVELOPMENT AND EMBRYOLOGY.
2009,
2009,This is one of the most important subjects in the whole round of natural
2009,"history. The metamorphoses of insects, with which every one is familiar,"
2009,are generally effected abruptly by a few stages; but the transformations
2009,"are in reality numerous and gradual, though concealed. A certain"
2009,"ephemerous insect (Chloeon) during its development, moults, as shown by"
2009,"Sir J. Lubbock, above twenty times, and each time undergoes a certain"
2009,amount of change; and in this case we see the act of metamorphosis
2009,"performed in a primary and gradual manner. Many insects, and especially"
2009,"certain crustaceans, show us what wonderful changes of structure can be"
2009,"effected during development. Such changes, however, reach their acme in"
2009,"the so-called alternate generations of some of the lower animals. It is,"
2009,"for instance, an astonishing fact that a delicate branching coralline,"
2009,"studded with polypi, and attached to a submarine rock, should produce,"
2009,"first by budding and then by transverse division, a host of huge"
2009,"floating jelly-fishes; and that these should produce eggs, from which"
2009,"are hatched swimming animalcules, which attach themselves to rocks and"
2009,become developed into branching corallines; and so on in an endless
2009,cycle. The belief in the essential identity of the process of alternate
2009,generation and of ordinary metamorphosis has been greatly strengthened
2009,"by Wagner's discovery of the larva or maggot of a fly, namely the"
2009,"Cecidomyia, producing asexually other larvae, and these others, which"
2009,"finally are developed into mature males and females, propagating their"
2009,kind in the ordinary manner by eggs.
2009,
2009,It may be worth notice that when Wagner's remarkable discovery was first
2009,"announced, I was asked how was it possible to account for the larvae of"
2009,this fly having acquired the power of a sexual reproduction. As long as
2009,the case remained unique no answer could be given. But already Grimm has
2009,"shown that another fly, a Chironomus, reproduces itself in nearly the"
2009,"same manner, and he believes that this occurs frequently in the order."
2009,"It is the pupa, and not the larva, of the Chironomus which has this"
2009,"power; and Grimm further shows that this case, to a certain extent,"
2009,"""unites that of the Cecidomyia with the parthenogenesis of the"
2009,"Coccidae;"" the term parthenogenesis implying that the mature females of"
2009,the Coccidae are capable of producing fertile eggs without the concourse
2009,of the male. Certain animals belonging to several classes are now known
2009,to have the power of ordinary reproduction at an unusually early age;
2009,and we have only to accelerate parthenogenetic reproduction by gradual
2009,steps to an earlier and earlier age--Chironomus showing us an almost
2009,"exactly intermediate stage, viz., that of the pupa--and we can perhaps"
2009,account for the marvellous case of the Cecidomyia.
2009,
2009,"It has already been stated that various parts in the same individual,"
2009,"which are exactly alike during an early embryonic period, become widely"
2009,different and serve for widely different purposes in the adult state. So
2009,again it has been shown that generally the embryos of the most distinct
2009,"species belonging to the same class are closely similar, but become,"
2009,"when fully developed, widely dissimilar. A better proof of this latter"
2009,"fact cannot be given than the statement by Von Baer that ""the embryos of"
2009,"mammalia, of birds, lizards and snakes, probably also of chelonia, are"
2009,"in the earliest states exceedingly like one another, both as a whole and"
2009,"in the mode of development of their parts; so much so, in fact, that we"
2009,can often distinguish the embryos only by their size. In my possession
2009,"are two little embryos in spirit, whose names I have omitted to attach,"
2009,and at present I am quite unable to say to what class they belong. They
2009,"may be lizards or small birds, or very young mammalia, so complete is"
2009,the similarity in the mode of formation of the head and trunk in these
2009,"animals. The extremities, however, are still absent in these embryos."
2009,But even if they had existed in the earliest stage of their development
2009,"we should learn nothing, for the feet of lizards and mammals, the wings"
2009,"and feet of birds, no less than the hands and feet of man, all arise"
2009,"from the same fundamental form."" The larvae of most crustaceans, at"
2009,"corresponding stages of development, closely resemble each other,"
2009,however different the adults may become; and so it is with very many
2009,other animals. A trace of the law of embryonic resemblance occasionally
2009,"lasts till a rather late age: thus birds of the same genus, and of"
2009,"allied genera, often resemble each other in their immature plumage; as"
2009,we see in the spotted feathers in the young of the thrush group. In
2009,"the cat tribe, most of the species when adult are striped or spotted in"
2009,lines; and stripes or spots can be plainly distinguished in the whelp of
2009,"the lion and the puma. We occasionally, though rarely, see something of"
2009,"the same kind in plants; thus the first leaves of the ulex or furze, and"
2009,"the first leaves of the phyllodineous acacias, are pinnate or divided"
2009,like the ordinary leaves of the leguminosae.
2009,
2009,"The points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different"
2009,"animals within the same class resemble each other, often have no direct"
2009,"relation to their conditions of existence. We cannot, for instance,"
2009,suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like
2009,courses of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar
2009,conditions--in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its
2009,"mother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest, and in the"
2009,spawn of a frog under water. We have no more reason to believe in such a
2009,relation than we have to believe that the similar bones in the hand of
2009,"a man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise, are related to similar"
2009,conditions of life. No one supposes that the stripes on the whelp of
2009,"a lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, are of any use to these"
2009,animals.
2009,
2009,"The case, however, is different when an animal, during any part of its"
2009,"embryonic career, is active, and has to provide for itself. The period"
2009,of activity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever it comes
2009,"on, the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as"
2009,perfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal. In how important a
2009,"manner this has acted, has recently been well shown by Sir J. Lubbock"
2009,in his remarks on the close similarity of the larvae of some insects
2009,"belonging to very different orders, and on the dissimilarity of the"
2009,"larvae of other insects within the same order, according to their habits"
2009,of life. Owing to such adaptations the similarity of the larvae of
2009,allied animals is sometimes greatly obscured; especially when there is
2009,"a division of labour during the different stages of development, as"
2009,"when the same larva has during one stage to search for food, and during"
2009,another stage has to search for a place of attachment. Cases can even be
2009,"given of the larvae of allied species, or groups of species, differing"
2009,"more from each other than do the adults. In most cases, however, the"
2009,"larvae, though active, still obey, more or less closely, the law of"
2009,common embryonic resemblance. Cirripedes afford a good instance of
2009,this: even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was
2009,a crustacean: but a glance at the larva shows this in an unmistakable
2009,"manner. So again the two main divisions of cirripedes, the pedunculated"
2009,"and sessile, though differing widely in external appearance, have larvae"
2009,in all their stages barely distinguishable.
2009,
2009,The embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation.
2009,"I use this expression, though I am aware that it is hardly possible to"
2009,define clearly what is meant by organisation being higher or lower.
2009,But no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than
2009,"the caterpillar. In some cases, however, the mature animal must be"
2009,"considered as lower in the scale than the larva, as with certain"
2009,parasitic crustaceans. To refer once again to cirripedes: the larvae in
2009,"the first stage have three pairs of locomotive organs, a simple single"
2009,"eye, and a probosciformed mouth, with which they feed largely, for they"
2009,"increase much in size. In the second stage, answering to the chrysalis"
2009,"stage of butterflies, they have six pairs of beautifully constructed"
2009,"natatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes, and extremely"
2009,"complex antennae; but they have a closed and imperfect mouth, and"
2009,"cannot feed: their function at this stage is, to search out by their"
2009,"well-developed organs of sense, and to reach by their active powers"
2009,"of swimming, a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo"
2009,their final metamorphosis. When this is completed they are fixed for
2009,life: their legs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again
2009,"obtain a well-constructed mouth; but they have no antennae, and their"
2009,"two eyes are now reconverted into a minute, single, simple eye-spot."
2009,"In this last and complete state, cirripedes may be considered as"
2009,either more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the
2009,larval condition. But in some genera the larvae become developed into
2009,"hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or into what I have called"
2009,complemental males; and in the latter the development has assuredly been
2009,"retrograde; for the male is a mere sack, which lives for a short time"
2009,"and is destitute of mouth, stomach, and every other organ of importance,"
2009,excepting those for reproduction.
2009,
2009,We are so much accustomed to see a difference in structure between the
2009,"embryo and the adult, that we are tempted to look at this difference as"
2009,in some necessary manner contingent on growth. But there is no reason
2009,"why, for instance, the wing of a bat, or the fin of a porpoise, should"
2009,"not have been sketched out with all their parts in proper proportion, as"
2009,soon as any part became visible. In some whole groups of animals and in
2009,"certain members of other groups this is the case, and the embryo does"
2009,not at any period differ widely from the adult: thus Owen has remarked
2009,"in regard to cuttle-fish, ""there is no metamorphosis; the cephalopodic"
2009,character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are
2009,"completed."" Land-shells and fresh-water crustaceans are born having"
2009,"their proper forms, while the marine members of the same two great"
2009,classes pass through considerable and often great changes during their
2009,"development. Spiders, again, barely undergo any metamorphosis. The"
2009,"larvae of most insects pass through a worm-like stage, whether they are"
2009,"active and adapted to diversified habits, or are inactive from being"
2009,"placed in the midst of proper nutriment, or from being fed by their"
2009,"parents; but in some few cases, as in that of Aphis, if we look to"
2009,"the admirable drawings of the development of this insect, by Professor"
2009,"Huxley, we see hardly any trace of the vermiform stage."
2009,
2009,"Sometimes it is only the earlier developmental stages which fail. Thus,"
2009,Fritz Muller has made the remarkable discovery that certain shrimp-like
2009,crustaceans (allied to Penoeus) first appear under the simple
2009,"nauplius-form, and after passing through two or more zoea-stages, and"
2009,"then through the mysis-stage, finally acquire their mature structure:"
2009,"now in the whole great malacostracan order, to which these crustaceans"
2009,"belong, no other member is as yet known to be first developed under the"
2009,"nauplius-form, though many appear as zoeas; nevertheless Muller assigns"
2009,"reasons for his belief, that if there had been no suppression of"
2009,"development, all these crustaceans would have appeared as nauplii."
2009,
2009,"How, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology--namely, the"
2009,"very general, though not universal, difference in structure between the"
2009,"embryo and the adult; the various parts in the same individual embryo,"
2009,"which ultimately become very unlike, and serve for diverse purposes,"
2009,"being at an early period of growth alike; the common, but not"
2009,"invariable, resemblance between the embryos or larvae of the most"
2009,"distinct species in the same class; the embryo often retaining, while"
2009,"within the egg or womb, structures which are of no service to it, either"
2009,"at that or at a later period of life; on the other hand, larvae which"
2009,"have to provide for their own wants, being perfectly adapted to the"
2009,"surrounding conditions; and lastly, the fact of certain larvae standing"
2009,higher in the scale of organisation than the mature animal into which
2009,they are developed? I believe that all these facts can be explained as
2009,follows.
2009,
2009,"It is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities affecting the embryo"
2009,"at a very early period, that slight variations or individual differences"
2009,necessarily appear at an equally early period. We have little evidence
2009,"on this head, but what we have certainly points the other way; for it"
2009,"is notorious that breeders of cattle, horses and various fancy animals,"
2009,"cannot positively tell, until some time after birth, what will be the"
2009,merits and demerits of their young animals. We see this plainly in our
2009,"own children; we cannot tell whether a child will be tall or short, or"
2009,"what its precise features will be. The question is not, at what period"
2009,"of life any variation may have been caused, but at what period the"
2009,"effects are displayed. The cause may have acted, and I believe often has"
2009,"acted, on one or both parents before the act of generation. It deserves"
2009,"notice that it is of no importance to a very young animal, as long as it"
2009,"is nourished and protected by its parent, whether most of its characters"
2009,"are acquired a little earlier or later in life. It would not signify,"
2009,"for instance, to a bird which obtained its food by having a much-curved"
2009,"beak whether or not while young it possessed a beak of this shape, as"
2009,long as it was fed by its parents.
2009,
2009,"I have stated in the first chapter, that at whatever age any variation"
2009,"first appears in the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age"
2009,in the offspring. Certain variations can only appear at corresponding
2009,"ages; for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago"
2009,"states of the silk-moth; or, again, in the full-grown horns of cattle."
2009,"But variations which, for all that we can see might have appeared either"
2009,"earlier or later in life, likewise tend to reappear at a corresponding"
2009,age in the offspring and parent. I am far from meaning that this is
2009,"invariably the case, and I could give several exceptional cases of"
2009,variations (taking the word in the largest sense) which have supervened
2009,at an earlier age in the child than in the parent.
2009,
2009,"These two principles, namely, that slight variations generally appear"
2009,"at a not very early period of life, and are inherited at a corresponding"
2009,"not early period, explain, as I believe, all the above specified leading"
2009,facts in embryology. But first let us look to a few analogous cases in
2009,our domestic varieties. Some authors who have written on Dogs maintain
2009,"that the greyhound and bull-dog, though so different, are really closely"
2009,"allied varieties, descended from the same wild stock, hence I was"
2009,curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other. I was
2009,"told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and"
2009,"this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually"
2009,"measuring the old dogs and their six-days-old puppies, I found that"
2009,the puppies had not acquired nearly their full amount of proportional
2009,"difference. So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and"
2009,race-horses--breeds which have been almost wholly formed by selection
2009,under domestication--differed as much as the full-grown animals; but
2009,having had careful measurements made of the dams and of three-days-old
2009,"colts of race and heavy cart-horses, I find that this is by no means the"
2009,case.
2009,
2009,As we have conclusive evidence that the breeds of the Pigeon are
2009,"descended from a single wild species, I compared the young pigeons"
2009,within twelve hours after being hatched. I carefully measured the
2009,"proportions (but will not here give the details) of the beak, width of"
2009,"mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of leg,"
2009,"in the wild parent species, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs, dragons,"
2009,"carriers, and tumblers. Now, some of these birds, when mature, differ in"
2009,"so extraordinary a manner in the length and form of beak, and in other"
2009,"characters, that they would certainly have been ranked as distinct"
2009,genera if found in a state of nature. But when the nestling birds of
2009,"these several breeds were placed in a row, though most of them could"
2009,"just be distinguished, the proportional differences in the above"
2009,specified points were incomparably less than in the full-grown birds.
2009,"Some characteristic points of difference--for instance, that of the"
2009,width of mouth--could hardly be detected in the young. But there was
2009,"one remarkable exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced"
2009,"tumbler differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon, and of the"
2009,"other breeds, in almost exactly the same proportions as in the adult"
2009,stage.
2009,
2009,These facts are explained by the above two principles. Fanciers select
2009,"their dogs, horses, pigeons, etc., for breeding, when nearly grown up."
2009,They are indifferent whether the desired qualities are acquired earlier
2009,"or later in life, if the full-grown animal possesses them. And the"
2009,"cases just given, more especially that of the pigeons, show that"
2009,the characteristic differences which have been accumulated by man's
2009,"selection, and which give value to his breeds, do not generally appear"
2009,"at a very early period of life, and are inherited at a corresponding not"
2009,"early period. But the case of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve"
2009,"hours old possessed its proper characters, proves that this is not the"
2009,universal rule; for here the characteristic differences must either have
2009,"appeared at an earlier period than usual, or, if not so, the differences"
2009,"must have been inherited, not at a corresponding, but at an earlier age."
2009,
2009,"Now, let us apply these two principles to species in a state of nature."
2009,"Let us take a group of birds, descended from some ancient form and"
2009,"modified through natural selection for different habits. Then, from"
2009,the many slight successive variations having supervened in the several
2009,"species at a not early age, and having been inherited at a corresponding"
2009,"age, the young will have been but little modified, and they will still"
2009,"resemble each other much more closely than do the adults, just as we"
2009,have seen with the breeds of the pigeon. We may extend this view to
2009,"widely distinct structures and to whole classes. The fore-limbs, for"
2009,"instance, which once served as legs to a remote progenitor, may have"
2009,"become, through a long course of modification, adapted in one descendant"
2009,"to act as hands, in another as paddles, in another as wings; but on the"
2009,above two principles the fore-limbs will not have been much modified in
2009,the embryos of these several forms; although in each form the fore-limb
2009,will differ greatly in the adult state. Whatever influence long
2009,continued use or disuse may have had in modifying the limbs or other
2009,"parts of any species, this will chiefly or solely have affected it when"
2009,"nearly mature, when it was compelled to use its full powers to gain its"
2009,own living; and the effects thus produced will have been transmitted to
2009,the offspring at a corresponding nearly mature age. Thus the young will
2009,"not be modified, or will be modified only in a slight degree, through"
2009,the effects of the increased use or disuse of parts.
2009,
2009,With some animals the successive variations may have supervened at a
2009,"very early period of life, or the steps may have been inherited at an"
2009,earlier age than that at which they first occurred. In either of these
2009,"cases the young or embryo will closely resemble the mature parent-form,"
2009,as we have seen with the short-faced tumbler. And this is the rule of
2009,"development in certain whole groups, or in certain sub-groups alone,"
2009,"as with cuttle-fish, land-shells, fresh-water crustaceans, spiders, and"
2009,some members of the great class of insects. With respect to the final
2009,"cause of the young in such groups not passing through any metamorphosis,"
2009,we can see that this would follow from the following contingencies:
2009,"namely, from the young having to provide at a very early age for their"
2009,"own wants, and from their following the same habits of life with their"
2009,parents; for in this case it would be indispensable for their existence
2009,"that they should be modified in the same manner as their parents. Again,"
2009,with respect to the singular fact that many terrestrial and fresh-water
2009,"animals do not undergo any metamorphosis, while marine members of the"
2009,"same groups pass through various transformations, Fritz Muller has"
2009,suggested that the process of slowly modifying and adapting an animal
2009,"to live on the land or in fresh water, instead of in the sea, would be"
2009,greatly simplified by its not passing through any larval stage; for it
2009,is not probable that places well adapted for both the larval and
2009,"mature stages, under such new and greatly changed habits of life, would"
2009,commonly be found unoccupied or ill-occupied by other organisms. In this
2009,case the gradual acquirement at an earlier and earlier age of the adult
2009,structure would be favoured by natural selection; and all traces of
2009,former metamorphoses would finally be lost.
2009,
2009,"If, on the other hand, it profited the young of an animal to follow"
2009,"habits of life slightly different from those of the parent-form, and"
2009,"consequently to be constructed on a slightly different plan, or if"
2009,it profited a larva already different from its parent to change still
2009,"further, then, on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages,"
2009,the young or the larvae might be rendered by natural selection more and
2009,more different from their parents to any conceivable extent. Differences
2009,"in the larva might, also, become correlated with successive stages of"
2009,"its development; so that the larva, in the first stage, might come to"
2009,"differ greatly from the larva in the second stage, as is the case with"
2009,"many animals. The adult might also become fitted for sites or habits, in"
2009,"which organs of locomotion or of the senses, etc., would be useless; and"
2009,in this case the metamorphosis would be retrograde.
2009,
2009,From the remarks just made we can see how by changes of structure in
2009,"the young, in conformity with changed habits of life, together with"
2009,"inheritance at corresponding ages, animals might come to pass through"
2009,"stages of development, perfectly distinct from the primordial condition"
2009,of their adult progenitors. Most of our best authorities are now
2009,convinced that the various larval and pupal stages of insects have thus
2009,"been acquired through adaptation, and not through inheritance from some"
2009,ancient form. The curious case of Sitaris--a beetle which passes through
2009,certain unusual stages of development--will illustrate how this might
2009,"occur. The first larval form is described by M. Fabre, as an active,"
2009,"minute insect, furnished with six legs, two long antennae, and four"
2009,eyes. These larvae are hatched in the nests of bees; and when the male
2009,"bees emerge from their burrows, in the spring, which they do before"
2009,"the females, the larvae spring on them, and afterwards crawl on to the"
2009,females while paired with the males. As soon as the female bee deposits
2009,"her eggs on the surface of the honey stored in the cells, the larvae of"
2009,the Sitaris leap on the eggs and devour them. Afterwards they undergo
2009,a complete change; their eyes disappear; their legs and antennae become
2009,"rudimentary, and they feed on honey; so that they now more closely"
2009,resemble the ordinary larvae of insects; ultimately they undergo a
2009,"further transformation, and finally emerge as the perfect beetle. Now,"
2009,"if an insect, undergoing transformations like those of the Sitaris, were"
2009,"to become the progenitor of a whole new class of insects, the course of"
2009,development of the new class would be widely different from that of
2009,our existing insects; and the first larval stage certainly would not
2009,represent the former condition of any adult and ancient form.
2009,
2009,On the other hand it is highly probable that with many animals the
2009,"embryonic or larval stages show us, more or less completely, the"
2009,condition of the progenitor of the whole group in its adult state. In
2009,"the great class of the Crustacea, forms wonderfully distinct from each"
2009,"other, namely, suctorial parasites, cirripedes, entomostraca, and even"
2009,"the malacostraca, appear at first as larvae under the nauplius-form; and"
2009,"as these larvae live and feed in the open sea, and are not adapted for"
2009,"any peculiar habits of life, and from other reasons assigned by Fritz"
2009,"Muller, it is probable that at some very remote period an independent"
2009,"adult animal, resembling the Nauplius, existed, and subsequently"
2009,"produced, along several divergent lines of descent, the above-named"
2009,"great Crustacean groups. So again, it is probable, from what we know of"
2009,"the embryos of mammals, birds, fishes and reptiles, that these animals"
2009,"are the modified descendants of some ancient progenitor, which was"
2009,"furnished in its adult state with branchiae, a swim-bladder, four"
2009,"fin-like limbs, and a long tail, all fitted for an aquatic life."
2009,
2009,"As all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived,"
2009,can be arranged within a few great classes; and as all within each
2009,"class have, according to our theory, been connected together by fine"
2009,"gradations, the best, and, if our collections were nearly perfect, the"
2009,"only possible arrangement, would be genealogical; descent being the"
2009,hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the
2009,term of the Natural System. On this view we can understand how it is
2009,"that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure of the embryo is"
2009,even more important for classification than that of the adult. In two or
2009,"more groups of animals, however much they may differ from each other"
2009,"in structure and habits in their adult condition, if they pass through"
2009,"closely similar embryonic stages, we may feel assured that they are all"
2009,"descended from one parent-form, and are therefore closely related."
2009,"Thus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent; but"
2009,dissimilarity in embryonic development does not prove discommunity of
2009,"descent, for in one of two groups the developmental stages may have been"
2009,"suppressed, or may have been so greatly modified through adaptation to"
2009,"new habits of life as to be no longer recognisable. Even in groups, in"
2009,"which the adults have been modified to an extreme degree, community of"
2009,"origin is often revealed by the structure of the larvae; we have seen,"
2009,"for instance, that cirripedes, though externally so like shell-fish,"
2009,are at once known by their larvae to belong to the great class of
2009,crustaceans. As the embryo often shows us more or less plainly the
2009,"structure of the less modified and ancient progenitor of the group, we"
2009,can see why ancient and extinct forms so often resemble in their
2009,adult state the embryos of existing species of the same class. Agassiz
2009,believes this to be a universal law of nature; and we may hope hereafter
2009,"to see the law proved true. It can, however, be proved true only in"
2009,those cases in which the ancient state of the progenitor of the group
2009,"has not been wholly obliterated, either by successive variations having"
2009,"supervened at a very early period of growth, or by such variations"
2009,having been inherited at an earlier age than that at which they first
2009,"appeared. It should also be borne in mind, that the law may be true,"
2009,"but yet, owing to the geological record not extending far enough back"
2009,"in time, may remain for a long period, or for ever, incapable of"
2009,demonstration. The law will not strictly hold good in those cases in
2009,which an ancient form became adapted in its larval state to some special
2009,"line of life, and transmitted the same larval state to a whole group"
2009,of descendants; for such larval state will not resemble any still more
2009,ancient form in its adult state.
2009,
2009,"Thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which"
2009,"are second to none in importance, are explained on the principle of"
2009,"variations in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor,"
2009,"having appeared at a not very early period of life, and having been"
2009,inherited at a corresponding period. Embryology rises greatly in
2009,"interest, when we look at the embryo as a picture, more or less"
2009,"obscured, of the progenitor, either in its adult or larval state, of all"
2009,the members of the same great class.
2009,
2009,"RUDIMENTARY, ATROPHIED, AND ABORTED ORGANS."
2009,
2009,"Organs or parts in this strange condition, bearing the plain stamp of"
2009,"inutility, are extremely common, or even general, throughout nature. It"
2009,would be impossible to name one of the higher animals in which some
2009,"part or other is not in a rudimentary condition. In the mammalia, for"
2009,"instance, the males possess rudimentary mammae; in snakes one lobe of"
2009,"the lungs is rudimentary; in birds the ""bastard-wing"" may safely be"
2009,"considered as a rudimentary digit, and in some species the whole wing is"
2009,so far rudimentary that it cannot be used for flight. What can be more
2009,"curious than the presence of teeth in foetal whales, which when grown up"
2009,"have not a tooth in their heads; or the teeth, which never cut through"
2009,"the gums, in the upper jaws of unborn calves?"
2009,
2009,Rudimentary organs plainly declare their origin and meaning in various
2009,"ways. There are beetles belonging to closely allied species, or even"
2009,"to the same identical species, which have either full-sized and perfect"
2009,"wings, or mere rudiments of membrane, which not rarely lie under"
2009,wing-covers firmly soldered together; and in these cases it is
2009,"impossible to doubt, that the rudiments represent wings. Rudimentary"
2009,organs sometimes retain their potentiality: this occasionally occurs
2009,"with the mammae of male mammals, which have been known to become well"
2009,"developed and to secrete milk. So again in the udders of the genus Bos,"
2009,there are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats; but the
2009,latter in our domestic cows sometimes become well developed and yield
2009,"milk. In regard to plants, the petals are sometimes rudimentary, and"
2009,sometimes well developed in the individuals of the same species. In
2009,certain plants having separated sexes Kolreuter found that by crossing a
2009,"species, in which the male flowers included a rudiment of a pistil, with"
2009,"an hermaphrodite species, having of course a well-developed pistil, the"
2009,rudiment in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size; and this
2009,clearly shows that the rudimentary and perfect pistils are essentially
2009,"alike in nature. An animal may possess various parts in a perfect state,"
2009,"and yet they may in one sense be rudimentary, for they are useless: thus"
2009,"the tadpole of the common salamander or water-newt, as Mr. G.H. Lewes"
2009,"remarks, ""has gills, and passes its existence in the water; but the"
2009,"Salamandra atra, which lives high up among the mountains, brings forth"
2009,its young full-formed. This animal never lives in the water. Yet if
2009,"we open a gravid female, we find tadpoles inside her with exquisitely"
2009,feathered gills; and when placed in water they swim about like the
2009,tadpoles of the water-newt. Obviously this aquatic organisation has no
2009,"reference to the future life of the animal, nor has it any adaptation"
2009,to its embryonic condition; it has solely reference to ancestral
2009,"adaptations, it repeats a phase in the development of its progenitors."""
2009,
2009,"An organ, serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly"
2009,"aborted for one, even the more important purpose, and remain perfectly"
2009,"efficient for the other. Thus, in plants, the office of the pistil is"
2009,to allow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules within the ovarium.
2009,The pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style; but in some
2009,"Compositae, the male florets, which of course cannot be fecundated, have"
2009,"a rudimentary pistil, for it is not crowned with a stigma; but the style"
2009,"remains well developed and is clothed in the usual manner with hairs,"
2009,which serve to brush the pollen out of the surrounding and conjoined
2009,"anthers. Again, an organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose,"
2009,and be used for a distinct one: in certain fishes the swim-bladder seems
2009,"to be rudimentary for its proper function of giving buoyancy, but has"
2009,become converted into a nascent breathing organ or lung. Many similar
2009,instances could be given.
2009,
2009,"Useful organs, however little they may be developed, unless we have"
2009,"reason to suppose that they were formerly more highly developed, ought"
2009,"not to be considered as rudimentary. They may be in a nascent condition,"
2009,"and in progress towards further development. Rudimentary organs, on"
2009,"the other hand, are either quite useless, such as teeth which never cut"
2009,"through the gums, or almost useless, such as the wings of an ostrich,"
2009,"which serve merely as sails. As organs in this condition would formerly,"
2009,"when still less developed, have been of even less use than at present,"
2009,they cannot formerly have been produced through variation and
2009,"natural selection, which acts solely by the preservation of useful"
2009,modifications. They have been partially retained by the power of
2009,"inheritance, and relate to a former state of things. It is, however,"
2009,often difficult to distinguish between rudimentary and nascent organs;
2009,for we can judge only by analogy whether a part is capable of further
2009,"development, in which case alone it deserves to be called nascent."
2009,Organs in this condition will always be somewhat rare; for beings thus
2009,provided will commonly have been supplanted by their successors with the
2009,"same organ in a more perfect state, and consequently will have become"
2009,"long ago extinct. The wing of the penguin is of high service, acting as"
2009,"a fin; it may, therefore, represent the nascent state of the wing: not"
2009,"that I believe this to be the case; it is more probably a reduced organ,"
2009,"modified for a new function: the wing of the Apteryx, on the other hand,"
2009,"is quite useless, and is truly rudimentary. Owen considers the simple"
2009,"filamentary limbs of the Lepidosiren as the ""beginnings of organs"
2009,"which attain full functional development in higher vertebrates;"" but,"
2009,"according to the view lately advocated by Dr. Gunther, they are probably"
2009,"remnants, consisting of the persistent axis of a fin, with the lateral"
2009,rays or branches aborted. The mammary glands of the Ornithorhynchus may
2009,"be considered, in comparison with the udders of a cow, as in a nascent"
2009,"condition. The ovigerous frena of certain cirripedes, which have ceased"
2009,"to give attachment to the ova and are feebly developed, are nascent"
2009,branchiae.
2009,
2009,Rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very
2009,liable to vary in the degree of their development and in other respects.
2009,"In closely allied species, also, the extent to which the same organ"
2009,has been reduced occasionally differs much. This latter fact is well
2009,exemplified in the state of the wings of female moths belonging to
2009,the same family. Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this
2009,"implies, that in certain animals or plants, parts are entirely absent"
2009,"which analogy would lead us to expect to find in them, and which"
2009,are occasionally found in monstrous individuals. Thus in most of
2009,the Scrophulariaceae the fifth stamen is utterly aborted; yet we may
2009,"conclude that a fifth stamen once existed, for a rudiment of it is found"
2009,"in many species of the family, and this rudiment occasionally becomes"
2009,"perfectly developed, as may sometimes be seen in the common snap-dragon."
2009,In tracing the homologies of any part in different members of the same
2009,"class, nothing is more common, or, in order fully to understand the"
2009,"relations of the parts, more useful than the discovery of rudiments."
2009,This is well shown in the drawings given by Owen of the leg bones of the
2009,"horse, ox, and rhinoceros."
2009,
2009,"It is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in the"
2009,"upper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the embryo,"
2009,"but afterwards wholly disappear. It is also, I believe, a universal"
2009,"rule, that a rudimentary part is of greater size in the embryo"
2009,"relatively to the adjoining parts, than in the adult; so that the organ"
2009,"at this early age is less rudimentary, or even cannot be said to be in"
2009,any degree rudimentary. Hence rudimentary organs in the adult are often
2009,said to have retained their embryonic condition.
2009,
2009,I have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs.
2009,"In reflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment; for"
2009,the same reasoning power which tells us that most parts and organs are
2009,"exquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal plainness"
2009,that these rudimentary or atrophied organs are imperfect and useless. In
2009,"works on natural history, rudimentary organs are generally said to have"
2009,"been created ""for the sake of symmetry,"" or in order ""to complete the"
2009,"scheme of nature."" But this is not an explanation, merely a restatement"
2009,of the fact. Nor is it consistent with itself: thus the boa-constrictor
2009,"has rudiments of hind limbs and of a pelvis, and if it be said that"
2009,"these bones have been retained ""to complete the scheme of nature,"" why,"
2009,"as Professor Weismann asks, have they not been retained by other snakes,"
2009,which do not possess even a vestige of these same bones? What would be
2009,thought of an astronomer who maintained that the satellites revolve in
2009,"elliptic courses round their planets ""for the sake of symmetry,"" because"
2009,the planets thus revolve round the sun? An eminent physiologist accounts
2009,"for the presence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve to"
2009,"excrete matter in excess, or matter injurious to the system; but can we"
2009,"suppose that the minute papilla, which often represents the pistil in"
2009,"male flowers, and which is formed of mere cellular tissue, can thus act?"
2009,"Can we suppose that rudimentary teeth, which are subsequently absorbed,"
2009,are beneficial to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by removing
2009,matter so precious as phosphate of lime? When a man's fingers have been
2009,"amputated, imperfect nails have been known to appear on the stumps, and"
2009,I could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails are developed in
2009,"order to excrete horny matter, as that the rudimentary nails on the fin"
2009,of the manatee have been developed for this same purpose.
2009,
2009,"On the view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary"
2009,organs is comparatively simple; and we can understand to a large extent
2009,the laws governing their imperfect development. We have plenty of cases
2009,"of rudimentary organs in our domestic productions, as the stump of a"
2009,"tail in tailless breeds, the vestige of an ear in earless breeds of"
2009,sheep--the reappearance of minute dangling horns in hornless breeds of
2009,"cattle, more especially, according to Youatt, in young animals--and the"
2009,state of the whole flower in the cauliflower. We often see rudiments of
2009,various parts in monsters; but I doubt whether any of these cases throw
2009,"light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature, further"
2009,than by showing that rudiments can be produced; for the balance of
2009,evidence clearly indicates that species under nature do not undergo
2009,great and abrupt changes. But we learn from the study of our domestic
2009,productions that the disuse of parts leads to their reduced size; and
2009,that the result is inherited.
2009,
2009,It appears probable that disuse has been the main agent in rendering
2009,organs rudimentary. It would at first lead by slow steps to the more
2009,"and more complete reduction of a part, until at last it became"
2009,rudimentary--as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark
2009,"caverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which"
2009,"have seldom been forced by beasts of prey to take flight, and have"
2009,"ultimately lost the power of flying. Again, an organ, useful under"
2009,"certain conditions, might become injurious under others, as with the"
2009,wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and in this case
2009,"natural selection will have aided in reducing the organ, until it was"
2009,rendered harmless and rudimentary.
2009,
2009,"Any change in structure and function, which can be effected by small"
2009,"stages, is within the power of natural selection; so that an organ"
2009,"rendered, through changed habits of life, useless or injurious for one"
2009,"purpose, might be modified and used for another purpose. An organ"
2009,"might, also, be retained for one alone of its former functions. Organs,"
2009,"originally formed by the aid of natural selection, when rendered useless"
2009,"may well be variable, for their variations can no longer be checked by"
2009,natural selection. All this agrees well with what we see under nature.
2009,"Moreover, at whatever period of life either disuse or selection reduces"
2009,"an organ, and this will generally be when the being has come to maturity"
2009,"and to exert its full powers of action, the principle of inheritance at"
2009,corresponding ages will tend to reproduce the organ in its reduced state
2009,"at the same mature age, but will seldom affect it in the embryo. Thus"
2009,we can understand the greater size of rudimentary organs in the embryo
2009,"relatively to the adjoining parts, and their lesser relative size in the"
2009,"adult. If, for instance, the digit of an adult animal was used less and"
2009,"less during many generations, owing to some change of habits, or if an"
2009,"organ or gland was less and less functionally exercised, we may infer"
2009,that it would become reduced in size in the adult descendants of this
2009,"animal, but would retain nearly its original standard of development in"
2009,the embryo.
2009,
2009,"There remains, however, this difficulty. After an organ has ceased being"
2009,"used, and has become in consequence much reduced, how can it be still"
2009,further reduced in size until the merest vestige is left; and how can it
2009,be finally quite obliterated? It is scarcely possible that disuse can go
2009,on producing any further effect after the organ has once been rendered
2009,functionless. Some additional explanation is here requisite which I
2009,"cannot give. If, for instance, it could be proved that every part of the"
2009,organisation tends to vary in a greater degree towards diminution than
2009,"toward augmentation of size, then we should be able to understand how an"
2009,"organ which has become useless would be rendered, independently of the"
2009,"effects of disuse, rudimentary and would at last be wholly suppressed;"
2009,for the variations towards diminished size would no longer be checked by
2009,"natural selection. The principle of the economy of growth, explained in"
2009,"a former chapter, by which the materials forming any part, if not useful"
2009,"to the possessor, are saved as far as is possible, will perhaps come"
2009,into play in rendering a useless part rudimentary. But this principle
2009,will almost necessarily be confined to the earlier stages of the process
2009,"of reduction; for we cannot suppose that a minute papilla, for instance,"
2009,"representing in a male flower the pistil of the female flower, and"
2009,"formed merely of cellular tissue, could be further reduced or absorbed"
2009,for the sake of economising nutriment.
2009,
2009,"Finally, as rudimentary organs, by whatever steps they may have been"
2009,"degraded into their present useless condition, are the record of a"
2009,"former state of things, and have been retained solely through the"
2009,"power of inheritance--we can understand, on the genealogical view of"
2009,"classification, how it is that systematists, in placing organisms in"
2009,"their proper places in the natural system, have often found rudimentary"
2009,"parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high"
2009,physiological importance. Rudimentary organs may be compared with the
2009,"letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless in"
2009,"the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue for its derivation. On the"
2009,"view of descent with modification, we may conclude that the existence"
2009,"of organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and useless condition, or quite"
2009,"aborted, far from presenting a strange difficulty, as they assuredly"
2009,"do on the old doctrine of creation, might even have been anticipated in"
2009,accordance with the views here explained.
2009,
2009,SUMMARY.
2009,
2009,In this chapter I have attempted to show that the arrangement of all
2009,organic beings throughout all time in groups under groups--that the
2009,nature of the relationships by which all living and extinct organisms
2009,"are united by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities"
2009,into a few grand classes--the rules followed and the difficulties
2009,encountered by naturalists in their classifications--the value set upon
2009,"characters, if constant and prevalent, whether of high or of the"
2009,"most trifling importance, or, as with rudimentary organs of no"
2009,importance--the wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive
2009,"characters, and characters of true affinity; and other such rules--all"
2009,"naturally follow if we admit the common parentage of allied forms,"
2009,together with their modification through variation and natural
2009,"selection, with the contingencies of extinction and divergence of"
2009,"character. In considering this view of classification, it should be"
2009,borne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used
2009,"in ranking together the sexes, ages, dimorphic forms, and acknowledged"
2009,"varieties of the same species, however much they may differ from each"
2009,other in structure. If we extend the use of this element of descent--the
2009,one certainly known cause of similarity in organic beings--we shall
2009,understand what is meant by the Natural System: it is genealogical in
2009,"its attempted arrangement, with the grades of acquired difference marked"
2009,"by the terms, varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and classes."
2009,
2009,"On this same view of descent with modification, most of the great facts"
2009,in Morphology become intelligible--whether we look to the same pattern
2009,displayed by the different species of the same class in their homologous
2009,"organs, to whatever purpose applied, or to the serial and lateral"
2009,homologies in each individual animal and plant.
2009,
2009,"On the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily"
2009,"or generally supervening at a very early period of life, and being"
2009,"inherited at a corresponding period, we can understand the leading facts"
2009,"in embryology; namely, the close resemblance in the individual embryo"
2009,"of the parts which are homologous, and which when matured become"
2009,widely different in structure and function; and the resemblance of the
2009,"homologous parts or organs in allied though distinct species, though"
2009,fitted in the adult state for habits as different as is possible. Larvae
2009,"are active embryos, which have become specially modified in a greater"
2009,"or less degree in relation to their habits of life, with their"
2009,modifications inherited at a corresponding early age. On these same
2009,"principles, and bearing in mind that when organs are reduced in size,"
2009,"either from disuse or through natural selection, it will generally be at"
2009,"that period of life when the being has to provide for its own wants, and"
2009,bearing in mind how strong is the force of inheritance--the occurrence
2009,of rudimentary organs might even have been anticipated. The importance
2009,of embryological characters and of rudimentary organs in classification
2009,"is intelligible, on the view that a natural arrangement must be"
2009,genealogical.
2009,
2009,"Finally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in"
2009,"this chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable"
2009,"species, genera and families, with which this world is peopled, are all"
2009,"descended, each within its own class or group, from common parents, and"
2009,"have all been modified in the course of descent, that I should without"
2009,"hesitation adopt this view, even if it were unsupported by other facts"
2009,or arguments.

2009,CHAPTER XV. RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION.
2009,
2009, Recapitulation of the objections to the theory of Natural
2009, Selection--Recapitulation of the general and special circumstances
2009, in its favour--Causes of the general belief in the immutability
2009, of species--How far the theory of Natural Selection may be
2009, extended--Effects of its adoption on the study of Natural
2009, History--Concluding remarks.
2009,
2009,
2009,"As this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the"
2009,reader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated.
2009,
2009,That many and serious objections may be advanced against the theory of
2009,"descent with modification through variation and natural selection, I do"
2009,not deny. I have endeavoured to give to them their full force. Nothing
2009,at first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex
2009,"organs and instincts have been perfected, not by means superior"
2009,"to, though analogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of"
2009,"innumerable slight variations, each good for the individual possessor."
2009,"Nevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination"
2009,"insuperably great, cannot be considered real if we admit the following"
2009,"propositions, namely, that all parts of the organisation and instincts"
2009,"offer, at least individual differences--that there is a struggle for"
2009,existence leading to the preservation of profitable deviations of
2009,"structure or instinct--and, lastly, that gradations in the state of"
2009,"perfection of each organ may have existed, each good of its kind. The"
2009,"truth of these propositions cannot, I think, be disputed."
2009,
2009,"It is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what"
2009,"gradations many structures have been perfected, more especially among"
2009,"broken and failing groups of organic beings, which have suffered much"
2009,"extinction; but we see so many strange gradations in nature, that we"
2009,"ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct, or"
2009,"any whole structure, could not have arrived at its present state by"
2009,"many graduated steps. There are, it must be admitted, cases of special"
2009,difficulty opposed to the theory of natural selection; and one of the
2009,most curious of these is the existence in the same community of two
2009,or three defined castes of workers or sterile female ants; but I have
2009,attempted to show how these difficulties can be mastered.
2009,
2009,With respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first
2009,"crossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal"
2009,"fertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer the reader to the"
2009,"recapitulation of the facts given at the end of the ninth chapter, which"
2009,seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special
2009,endowment than is the incapacity of two distinct kinds of trees to be
2009,grafted together; but that it is incidental on differences confined to
2009,the reproductive systems of the intercrossed species. We see the truth
2009,of this conclusion in the vast difference in the results of crossing the
2009,"same two species reciprocally--that is, when one species is first used"
2009,as the father and then as the mother. Analogy from the consideration of
2009,"dimorphic and trimorphic plants clearly leads to the same conclusion,"
2009,"for when the forms are illegitimately united, they yield few or no seed,"
2009,and their offspring are more or less sterile; and these forms belong
2009,"to the same undoubted species, and differ from each other in no respect"
2009,except in their reproductive organs and functions.
2009,
2009,"Although the fertility of varieties when intercrossed, and of their"
2009,"mongrel offspring, has been asserted by so many authors to be universal,"
2009,this cannot be considered as quite correct after the facts given on the
2009,high authority of Gartner and Kolreuter. Most of the varieties which
2009,have been experimented on have been produced under domestication; and as
2009,domestication (I do not mean mere confinement) almost certainly tends
2009,"to eliminate that sterility which, judging from analogy, would have"
2009,"affected the parent-species if intercrossed, we ought not to expect"
2009,that domestication would likewise induce sterility in their modified
2009,descendants when crossed. This elimination of sterility apparently
2009,follows from the same cause which allows our domestic animals to breed
2009,freely under diversified circumstances; and this again apparently
2009,follows from their having been gradually accustomed to frequent changes
2009,in their conditions of life.
2009,
2009,A double and parallel series of facts seems to throw much light on the
2009,"sterility of species, when first crossed, and of their hybrid offspring."
2009,"On the one side, there is good reason to believe that slight changes in"
2009,the conditions of life give vigour and fertility to all organic beings.
2009,We know also that a cross between the distinct individuals of the same
2009,"variety, and between distinct varieties, increases the number of their"
2009,"offspring, and certainly gives to them increased size and vigour. This"
2009,is chiefly owing to the forms which are crossed having been exposed
2009,to somewhat different conditions of life; for I have ascertained by a
2009,labourious series of experiments that if all the individuals of the same
2009,"variety be subjected during several generations to the same conditions,"
2009,the good derived from crossing is often much diminished or wholly
2009,"disappears. This is one side of the case. On the other side, we know"
2009,"that species which have long been exposed to nearly uniform conditions,"
2009,when they are subjected under confinement to new and greatly changed
2009,"conditions, either perish, or if they survive, are rendered sterile,"
2009,"though retaining perfect health. This does not occur, or only in a very"
2009,"slight degree, with our domesticated productions, which have long been"
2009,exposed to fluctuating conditions. Hence when we find that hybrids
2009,"produced by a cross between two distinct species are few in number,"
2009,"owing to their perishing soon after conception or at a very early age,"
2009,"or if surviving that they are rendered more or less sterile, it seems"
2009,highly probable that this result is due to their having been in fact
2009,"subjected to a great change in their conditions of life, from being"
2009,compounded of two distinct organisations. He who will explain in a
2009,"definite manner why, for instance, an elephant or a fox will not breed"
2009,"under confinement in its native country, whilst the domestic pig or dog"
2009,"will breed freely under the most diversified conditions, will at the"
2009,same time be able to give a definite answer to the question why two
2009,"distinct species, when crossed, as well as their hybrid offspring,"
2009,"are generally rendered more or less sterile, while two domesticated"
2009,varieties when crossed and their mongrel offspring are perfectly
2009,fertile.
2009,
2009,"Turning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered on"
2009,the theory of descent with modification are serious enough. All the
2009,"individuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus,"
2009,"or even higher group, are descended from common parents; and therefore,"
2009,in however distant and isolated parts of the world they may now be
2009,"found, they must in the course of successive generations have travelled"
2009,from some one point to all the others. We are often wholly unable even
2009,"to conjecture how this could have been effected. Yet, as we have reason"
2009,to believe that some species have retained the same specific form for
2009,"very long periods of time, immensely long as measured by years, too much"
2009,stress ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the same
2009,species; for during very long periods there will always have been a good
2009,chance for wide migration by many means. A broken or interrupted range
2009,may often be accounted for by the extinction of the species in the
2009,intermediate regions. It cannot be denied that we are as yet
2009,very ignorant as to the full extent of the various climatical and
2009,geographical changes which have affected the earth during modern
2009,periods; and such changes will often have facilitated migration. As an
2009,"example, I have attempted to show how potent has been the influence of"
2009,the Glacial period on the distribution of the same and of allied species
2009,throughout the world. We are as yet profoundly ignorant of the many
2009,occasional means of transport. With respect to distinct species of the
2009,"same genus, inhabiting distant and isolated regions, as the process of"
2009,"modification has necessarily been slow, all the means of migration"
2009,will have been possible during a very long period; and consequently the
2009,difficulty of the wide diffusion of the species of the same genus is in
2009,some degree lessened.
2009,
2009,As according to the theory of natural selection an interminable number
2009,"of intermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the"
2009,"species in each group by gradations as fine as our existing varieties,"
2009,"it may be asked, Why do we not see these linking forms all around us?"
2009,Why are not all organic beings blended together in an inextricable
2009,"chaos? With respect to existing forms, we should remember that we"
2009,have no right to expect (excepting in rare cases) to discover DIRECTLY
2009,"connecting links between them, but only between each and some extinct"
2009,"and supplanted form. Even on a wide area, which has during a long period"
2009,"remained continuous, and of which the climatic and other conditions of"
2009,life change insensibly in proceeding from a district occupied by one
2009,"species into another district occupied by a closely allied species, we"
2009,have no just right to expect often to find intermediate varieties in
2009,the intermediate zones. For we have reason to believe that only a few
2009,species of a genus ever undergo change; the other species becoming
2009,utterly extinct and leaving no modified progeny. Of the species which do
2009,"change, only a few within the same country change at the same time;"
2009,and all modifications are slowly effected. I have also shown that
2009,the intermediate varieties which probably at first existed in the
2009,"intermediate zones, would be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms"
2009,"on either hand; for the latter, from existing in greater numbers,"
2009,would generally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than the
2009,"intermediate varieties, which existed in lesser numbers; so that"
2009,"the intermediate varieties would, in the long run, be supplanted and"
2009,exterminated.
2009,
2009,On this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting
2009,"links, between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world, and at"
2009,"each successive period between the extinct and still older species, why"
2009,is not every geological formation charged with such links? Why does
2009,not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the
2009,gradation and mutation of the forms of life? Although geological
2009,"research has undoubtedly revealed the former existence of many links,"
2009,"bringing numerous forms of life much closer together, it does not yield"
2009,the infinitely many fine gradations between past and present species
2009,"required on the theory, and this is the most obvious of the many"
2009,"objections which may be urged against it. Why, again, do whole groups"
2009,"of allied species appear, though this appearance is often false, to have"
2009,come in suddenly on the successive geological stages? Although we
2009,"now know that organic beings appeared on this globe, at a period"
2009,"incalculably remote, long before the lowest bed of the Cambrian system"
2009,"was deposited, why do we not find beneath this system great piles"
2009,of strata stored with the remains of the progenitors of the Cambrian
2009,"fossils? For on the theory, such strata must somewhere have been"
2009,deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs of the world's
2009,history.
2009,
2009,I can answer these questions and objections only on the supposition
2009,that the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists
2009,believe. The number of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as
2009,nothing compared with the countless generations of countless species
2009,which have certainly existed. The parent form of any two or more species
2009,would not be in all its characters directly intermediate between
2009,"its modified offspring, any more than the rock-pigeon is directly"
2009,"intermediate in crop and tail between its descendants, the pouter and"
2009,fantail pigeons. We should not be able to recognise a species as the
2009,"parent of another and modified species, if we were to examine the two"
2009,"ever so closely, unless we possessed most of the intermediate links;"
2009,"and owing to the imperfection of the geological record, we have no just"
2009,"right to expect to find so many links. If two or three, or even more"
2009,"linking forms were discovered, they would simply be ranked by many"
2009,"naturalists as so many new species, more especially if found in"
2009,"different geological substages, let their differences be ever so slight."
2009,Numerous existing doubtful forms could be named which are probably
2009,varieties; but who will pretend that in future ages so many fossil links
2009,"will be discovered, that naturalists will be able to decide whether"
2009,or not these doubtful forms ought to be called varieties? Only a small
2009,portion of the world has been geologically explored. Only organic beings
2009,"of certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition, at least"
2009,in any great number. Many species when once formed never undergo any
2009,further change but become extinct without leaving modified descendants;
2009,"and the periods during which species have undergone modification, though"
2009,"long as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with"
2009,the periods during which they retained the same form. It is the dominant
2009,"and widely ranging species which vary most frequently and vary most, and"
2009,varieties are often at first local--both causes rendering the discovery
2009,of intermediate links in any one formation less likely. Local
2009,varieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are
2009,"considerably modified and improved; and when they have spread, and are"
2009,"discovered in a geological formation, they appear as if suddenly created"
2009,"there, and will be simply classed as new species. Most formations have"
2009,been intermittent in their accumulation; and their duration has probably
2009,been shorter than the average duration of specific forms. Successive
2009,formations are in most cases separated from each other by blank
2009,"intervals of time of great length, for fossiliferous formations"
2009,"thick enough to resist future degradation can, as a general rule, be"
2009,accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed
2009,of the sea. During the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary
2009,level the record will generally be blank. During these latter periods
2009,there will probably be more variability in the forms of life; during
2009,"periods of subsidence, more extinction."
2009,
2009,With respect to the absence of strata rich in fossils beneath the
2009,"Cambrian formation, I can recur only to the hypothesis given in the"
2009,"tenth chapter; namely, that though our continents and oceans have"
2009,endured for an enormous period in nearly their present relative
2009,"positions, we have no reason to assume that this has always been the"
2009,case; consequently formations much older than any now known may lie
2009,buried beneath the great oceans. With respect to the lapse of time not
2009,having been sufficient since our planet was consolidated for the assumed
2009,"amount of organic change, and this objection, as urged by Sir William"
2009,"Thompson, is probably one of the gravest as yet advanced, I can only"
2009,"say, firstly, that we do not know at what rate species change, as"
2009,"measured by years, and secondly, that many philosophers are not as yet"
2009,willing to admit that we know enough of the constitution of the universe
2009,and of the interior of our globe to speculate with safety on its past
2009,duration.
2009,
2009,That the geological record is imperfect all will admit; but that it is
2009,"imperfect to the degree required by our theory, few will be inclined"
2009,"to admit. If we look to long enough intervals of time, geology plainly"
2009,declares that species have all changed; and they have changed in the
2009,"manner required by the theory, for they have changed slowly and in"
2009,a graduated manner. We clearly see this in the fossil remains from
2009,consecutive formations invariably being much more closely related to
2009,each other than are the fossils from widely separated formations.
2009,
2009,Such is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties
2009,which may justly be urged against the theory; and I have now briefly
2009,"recapitulated the answers and explanations which, as far as I can see,"
2009,may be given. I have felt these difficulties far too heavily during many
2009,years to doubt their weight. But it deserves especial notice that
2009,the more important objections relate to questions on which we are
2009,confessedly ignorant; nor do we know how ignorant we are. We do not know
2009,all the possible transitional gradations between the simplest and the
2009,most perfect organs; it cannot be pretended that we know all the varied
2009,"means of Distribution during the long lapse of years, or that we"
2009,know how imperfect is the Geological Record. Serious as these several
2009,"objections are, in my judgment they are by no means sufficient to"
2009,overthrow the theory of descent with subsequent modification.
2009,
2009,Now let us turn to the other side of the argument. Under domestication
2009,"we see much variability, caused, or at least excited, by changed"
2009,"conditions of life; but often in so obscure a manner, that we are"
2009,tempted to consider the variations as spontaneous. Variability is
2009,"governed by many complex laws, by correlated growth, compensation,"
2009,"the increased use and disuse of parts, and the definite action of the"
2009,surrounding conditions. There is much difficulty in ascertaining how
2009,largely our domestic productions have been modified; but we may safely
2009,"infer that the amount has been large, and that modifications can be"
2009,inherited for long periods. As long as the conditions of life remain the
2009,"same, we have reason to believe that a modification, which has already"
2009,"been inherited for many generations, may continue to be inherited for"
2009,an almost infinite number of generations. On the other hand we have
2009,"evidence that variability, when it has once come into play, does not"
2009,cease under domestication for a very long period; nor do we know that
2009,"it ever ceases, for new varieties are still occasionally produced by our"
2009,oldest domesticated productions.
2009,
2009,Variability is not actually caused by man; he only unintentionally
2009,exposes organic beings to new conditions of life and then nature acts on
2009,the organisation and causes it to vary. But man can and does select
2009,"the variations given to him by nature, and thus accumulates them in any"
2009,desired manner. He thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or
2009,"pleasure. He may do this methodically, or he may do it unconsciously by"
2009,preserving the individuals most useful or pleasing to him without any
2009,intention of altering the breed. It is certain that he can largely
2009,"influence the character of a breed by selecting, in each successive"
2009,"generation, individual differences so slight as to be inappreciable"
2009,except by an educated eye. This unconscious process of selection has
2009,been the great agency in the formation of the most distinct and useful
2009,domestic breeds. That many breeds produced by man have to a large extent
2009,"the character of natural species, is shown by the inextricable doubts"
2009,whether many of them are varieties or aboriginally distinct species.
2009,
2009,There is no reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently
2009,under domestication should not have acted under nature. In the survival
2009,"of favoured individuals and races, during the constantly recurrent"
2009,"Struggle for Existence, we see a powerful and ever-acting form of"
2009,Selection. The struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high
2009,geometrical ratio of increase which is common to all organic beings.
2009,This high rate of increase is proved by calculation--by the rapid
2009,increase of many animals and plants during a succession of peculiar
2009,"seasons, and when naturalised in new countries. More individuals are"
2009,born than can possibly survive. A grain in the balance may determine
2009,which individuals shall live and which shall die--which variety or
2009,"species shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally"
2009,become extinct. As the individuals of the same species come in all
2009,"respects into the closest competition with each other, the struggle will"
2009,generally be most severe between them; it will be almost equally severe
2009,"between the varieties of the same species, and next in severity between"
2009,the species of the same genus. On the other hand the struggle will often
2009,be severe between beings remote in the scale of nature. The slightest
2009,"advantage in certain individuals, at any age or during any season, over"
2009,"those with which they come into competition, or better adaptation in"
2009,"however slight a degree to the surrounding physical conditions, will, in"
2009,"the long run, turn the balance."
2009,
2009,"With animals having separated sexes, there will be in most cases a"
2009,struggle between the males for the possession of the females. The most
2009,"vigorous males, or those which have most successfully struggled with"
2009,"their conditions of life, will generally leave most progeny. But success"
2009,will often depend on the males having special weapons or means of
2009,defence or charms; and a slight advantage will lead to victory.
2009,
2009,As geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical
2009,"changes, we might have expected to find that organic beings have varied"
2009,"under nature, in the same way as they have varied under domestication."
2009,"And if there has been any variability under nature, it would be an"
2009,unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into play. It has
2009,"often been asserted, but the assertion is incapable of proof, that the"
2009,"amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited quantity. Man,"
2009,"though acting on external characters alone and often capriciously,"
2009,can produce within a short period a great result by adding up mere
2009,individual differences in his domestic productions; and every one
2009,"admits that species present individual differences. But, besides such"
2009,"differences, all naturalists admit that natural varieties exist,"
2009,which are considered sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record
2009,in systematic works. No one has drawn any clear distinction between
2009,individual differences and slight varieties; or between more plainly
2009,"marked varieties and subspecies and species. On separate continents, and"
2009,"on different parts of the same continent, when divided by barriers of"
2009,"any kind, and on outlying islands, what a multitude of forms exist,"
2009,"which some experienced naturalists rank as varieties, others as"
2009,"geographical races or sub species, and others as distinct, though"
2009,closely allied species!
2009,
2009,"If, then, animals and plants do vary, let it be ever so slightly or"
2009,"slowly, why should not variations or individual differences, which are"
2009,"in any way beneficial, be preserved and accumulated through natural"
2009,"selection, or the survival of the fittest? If man can by patience select"
2009,"variations useful to him, why, under changing and complex conditions"
2009,"of life, should not variations useful to nature's living products often"
2009,"arise, and be preserved or selected? What limit can be put to this"
2009,"power, acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole"
2009,"constitution, structure, and habits of each creature, favouring the good"
2009,"and rejecting the bad? I can see no limit to this power, in slowly and"
2009,beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life.
2009,"The theory of natural selection, even if we look no further than"
2009,"this, seems to be in the highest degree probable. I have already"
2009,"recapitulated, as fairly as I could, the opposed difficulties and"
2009,objections: now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in favour
2009,of the theory.
2009,
2009,On the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent
2009,"varieties, and that each species first existed as a variety, we can"
2009,"see why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species,"
2009,"commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation,"
2009,and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary
2009,laws. On this same view we can understand how it is that in a region
2009,"where many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now"
2009,"flourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where"
2009,"the manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a"
2009,"general rule, to find it still in action; and this is the case if"
2009,"varieties be incipient species. Moreover, the species of the larger"
2009,"genera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient"
2009,"species, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties; for"
2009,they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the
2009,species of smaller genera. The closely allied species also of a larger
2009,"genera apparently have restricted ranges, and in their affinities they"
2009,are clustered in little groups round other species--in both respects
2009,resembling varieties. These are strange relations on the view that each
2009,"species was independently created, but are intelligible if each existed"
2009,first as a variety.
2009,
2009,As each species tends by its geometrical rate of reproduction to
2009,increase inordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of
2009,each species will be enabled to increase by as much as they become more
2009,"diversified in habits and structure, so as to be able to seize on many"
2009,"and widely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a"
2009,constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent
2009,offspring of any one species. Hence during a long-continued course of
2009,"modification, the slight differences characteristic of varieties of"
2009,"the same species, tend to be augmented into the greater differences"
2009,characteristic of the species of the same genus. New and improved
2009,"varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less"
2009,improved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a
2009,large extent defined and distinct objects. Dominant species belonging
2009,to the larger groups within each class tend to give birth to new and
2009,"dominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger,"
2009,and at the same time more divergent in character. But as all groups
2009,"cannot thus go on increasing in size, for the world would not hold them,"
2009,the more dominant groups beat the less dominant. This tendency in the
2009,"large groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character,"
2009,"together with the inevitable contingency of much extinction, explains"
2009,the arrangement of all the forms of life in groups subordinate to
2009,"groups, all within a few great classes, which has prevailed throughout"
2009,all time. This grand fact of the grouping of all organic beings under
2009,"what is called the Natural System, is utterly inexplicable on the theory"
2009,of creation.
2009,
2009,"As natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive,"
2009,"favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modifications;"
2009,"it can act only by short and slow steps. Hence, the canon of ""Natura"
2009,"non facit saltum,"" which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends"
2009,"to confirm, is on this theory intelligible. We can see why throughout"
2009,nature the same general end is gained by an almost infinite diversity of
2009,"means, for every peculiarity when once acquired is long inherited, and"
2009,structures already modified in many different ways have to be adapted
2009,"for the same general purpose. We can, in short, see why nature is"
2009,"prodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. But why this should"
2009,be a law of nature if each species has been independently created no man
2009,can explain.
2009,
2009,"Many other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. How"
2009,"strange it is that a bird, under the form of a woodpecker, should prey"
2009,"on insects on the ground; that upland geese, which rarely or never swim,"
2009,would possess webbed feet; that a thrush-like bird should dive and feed
2009,on sub-aquatic insects; and that a petrel should have the habits and
2009,structure fitting it for the life of an auk! and so in endless other
2009,cases. But on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in
2009,"number, with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying"
2009,"descendants of each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature,"
2009,"these facts cease to be strange, or might even have been anticipated."
2009,
2009,We can to a certain extent understand how it is that there is so much
2009,beauty throughout nature; for this may be largely attributed to the
2009,"agency of selection. That beauty, according to our sense of it, is not"
2009,"universal, must be admitted by every one who will look at some venomous"
2009,"snakes, at some fishes, and at certain hideous bats with a distorted"
2009,resemblance to the human face. Sexual selection has given the most
2009,"brilliant colours, elegant patterns, and other ornaments to the males,"
2009,"and sometimes to both sexes of many birds, butterflies and other"
2009,animals. With birds it has often rendered the voice of the male musical
2009,"to the female, as well as to our ears. Flowers and fruit have been"
2009,rendered conspicuous by brilliant colours in contrast with the green
2009,"foliage, in order that the flowers may be easily seen, visited and"
2009,"fertilised by insects, and the seeds disseminated by birds. How it comes"
2009,"that certain colours, sounds and forms should give pleasure to man and"
2009,"the lower animals, that is, how the sense of beauty in its simplest form"
2009,"was first acquired, we do not know any more than how certain odours and"
2009,flavours were first rendered agreeable.
2009,
2009,"As natural selection acts by competition, it adapts and improves the"
2009,inhabitants of each country only in relation to their co-inhabitants;
2009,"so that we need feel no surprise at the species of any one country,"
2009,although on the ordinary view supposed to have been created and
2009,"specially adapted for that country, being beaten and supplanted by the"
2009,naturalised productions from another land. Nor ought we to marvel if all
2009,"the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely"
2009,perfect; as in the case even of the human eye; or if some of them be
2009,abhorrent to our ideas of fitness. We need not marvel at the sting of
2009,"the bee, when used against the enemy, causing the bee's own death; at"
2009,"drones being produced in such great numbers for one single act, and"
2009,being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing
2009,waste of pollen by our fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred of the
2009,queen-bee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidae feeding within
2009,"the living bodies of caterpillars; and at other such cases. The wonder,"
2009,"indeed, is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of the"
2009,want of absolute perfection have not been detected.
2009,
2009,The complex and little known laws governing the production of varieties
2009,"are the same, as far as we can judge, with the laws which have governed"
2009,the production of distinct species. In both cases physical conditions
2009,"seem to have produced some direct and definite effect, but how much"
2009,"we cannot say. Thus, when varieties enter any new station, they"
2009,occasionally assume some of the characters proper to the species of that
2009,"station. With both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have"
2009,produced a considerable effect; for it is impossible to resist this
2009,"conclusion when we look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which"
2009,"has wings incapable of flight, in nearly the same condition as in the"
2009,"domestic duck; or when we look at the burrowing tucu-tucu, which is"
2009,"occasionally blind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually"
2009,blind and have their eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the
2009,blind animals inhabiting the dark caves of America and Europe. With
2009,"varieties and species, correlated variation seems to have played an"
2009,"important part, so that when one part has been modified other parts have"
2009,"been necessarily modified. With both varieties and species, reversions"
2009,to long-lost characters occasionally occur. How inexplicable on the
2009,theory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the
2009,shoulders and legs of the several species of the horse-genus and of
2009,their hybrids! How simply is this fact explained if we believe that
2009,"these species are all descended from a striped progenitor, in the same"
2009,manner as the several domestic breeds of the pigeon are descended from
2009,the blue and barred rock-pigeon!
2009,
2009,"On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,"
2009,"why should specific characters, or those by which the species of the"
2009,"same genus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic"
2009,"characters in which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the colour"
2009,"of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if"
2009,"the other species possess differently coloured flowers, than if all"
2009,possessed the same coloured flowers? If species are only well-marked
2009,"varieties, of which the characters have become in a high degree"
2009,"permanent, we can understand this fact; for they have already varied"
2009,"since they branched off from a common progenitor in certain characters,"
2009,by which they have come to be specifically distinct from each other;
2009,therefore these same characters would be more likely again to vary than
2009,the generic characters which have been inherited without change for an
2009,immense period. It is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part
2009,"developed in a very unusual manner in one species alone of a genus,"
2009,"and therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great importance to that"
2009,"species, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on our view, this"
2009,"part has undergone, since the several species branched off from a common"
2009,"progenitor, an unusual amount of variability and modification, and"
2009,therefore we might expect the part generally to be still variable. But
2009,"a part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like the wing of a"
2009,"bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the part"
2009,"be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been inherited"
2009,for a very long period; for in this case it will have been rendered
2009,constant by long-continued natural selection.
2009,
2009,"Glancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater"
2009,difficulty than do corporeal structures on the theory of the natural
2009,"selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. We"
2009,can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing
2009,different animals of the same class with their several instincts. I have
2009,attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws on
2009,the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt
2009,often comes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not
2009,"indispensable, as we see in the case of neuter insects, which leave no"
2009,progeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. On the view of
2009,"all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent,"
2009,"and having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is that"
2009,"allied species, when placed under widely different conditions of life,"
2009,yet follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrushes of tropical and
2009,"temperate South America, for instance, line their nests with mud"
2009,like our British species. On the view of instincts having been slowly
2009,"acquired through natural selection, we need not marvel at some instincts"
2009,"being not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many instincts causing"
2009,other animals to suffer.
2009,
2009,"If species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can at once"
2009,see why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws
2009,in their degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents--in being
2009,"absorbed into each other by successive crosses, and in other such"
2009,points--as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. This
2009,"similarity would be a strange fact, if species had been independently"
2009,created and varieties had been produced through secondary laws.
2009,
2009,If we admit that the geological record is imperfect to an extreme
2009,"degree, then the facts, which the record does give, strongly support the"
2009,theory of descent with modification. New species have come on the stage
2009,slowly and at successive intervals; and the amount of change after
2009,"equal intervals of time, is widely different in different groups. The"
2009,"extinction of species and of whole groups of species, which has played"
2009,"so conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world, almost"
2009,inevitably follows from the principle of natural selection; for old
2009,forms are supplanted by new and improved forms. Neither single species
2009,nor groups of species reappear when the chain of ordinary generation
2009,"is once broken. The gradual diffusion of dominant forms, with the slow"
2009,"modification of their descendants, causes the forms of life, after"
2009,"long intervals of time, to appear as if they had changed simultaneously"
2009,throughout the world. The fact of the fossil remains of each formation
2009,being in some degree intermediate in character between the fossils
2009,"in the formations above and below, is simply explained by their"
2009,intermediate position in the chain of descent. The grand fact that all
2009,"extinct beings can be classed with all recent beings, naturally follows"
2009,from the living and the extinct being the offspring of common parents.
2009,As species have generally diverged in character during their long course
2009,"of descent and modification, we can understand why it is that the more"
2009,"ancient forms, or early progenitors of each group, so often occupy a"
2009,position in some degree intermediate between existing groups. Recent
2009,"forms are generally looked upon as being, on the whole, higher in the"
2009,"scale of organisation than ancient forms; and they must be higher, in"
2009,so far as the later and more improved forms have conquered the older and
2009,less improved forms in the struggle for life; they have also generally
2009,had their organs more specialised for different functions. This fact is
2009,perfectly compatible with numerous beings still retaining simple and but
2009,"little improved structures, fitted for simple conditions of life; it is"
2009,"likewise compatible with some forms having retrograded in organisation,"
2009,by having become at each stage of descent better fitted for new and
2009,"degraded habits of life. Lastly, the wonderful law of the long endurance"
2009,"of allied forms on the same continent--of marsupials in Australia, of"
2009,"edentata in America, and other such cases--is intelligible, for within"
2009,the same country the existing and the extinct will be closely allied by
2009,descent.
2009,
2009,"Looking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been"
2009,during the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world
2009,"to another, owing to former climatical and geographical changes and"
2009,"to the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can"
2009,"understand, on the theory of descent with modification, most of the"
2009,great leading facts in Distribution. We can see why there should be so
2009,striking a parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout
2009,"space, and in their geological succession throughout time; for in both"
2009,"cases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation,"
2009,and the means of modification have been the same. We see the full
2009,"meaning of the wonderful fact, which has struck every traveller, namely,"
2009,"that on the same continent, under the most diverse conditions, under"
2009,"heat and cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of"
2009,the inhabitants within each great class are plainly related; for they
2009,are the descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists. On
2009,"this same principle of former migration, combined in most cases with"
2009,"modification, we can understand, by the aid of the Glacial period, the"
2009,"identity of some few plants, and the close alliance of many others, on"
2009,"the most distant mountains, and in the northern and southern temperate"
2009,zones; and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the
2009,"sea in the northern and southern temperate latitudes, though separated"
2009,by the whole intertropical ocean. Although two countries may present
2009,"physical conditions as closely similar as the same species ever require,"
2009,"we need feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different,"
2009,if they have been for a long period completely sundered from each other;
2009,for as the relation of organism to organism is the most important of
2009,"all relations, and as the two countries will have received colonists at"
2009,"various periods and in different proportions, from some other country"
2009,"or from each other, the course of modification in the two areas will"
2009,inevitably have been different.
2009,
2009,"On this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we see why"
2009,"oceanic islands are inhabited by only few species, but of these, why"
2009,many are peculiar or endemic forms. We clearly see why species belonging
2009,"to those groups of animals which cannot cross wide spaces of the ocean,"
2009,"as frogs and terrestrial mammals, do not inhabit oceanic islands; and"
2009,"why, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of bats, animals which"
2009,"can traverse the ocean, are often found on islands far distant from any"
2009,continent. Such cases as the presence of peculiar species of bats on
2009,"oceanic islands and the absence of all other terrestrial mammals,"
2009,are facts utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of
2009,creation.
2009,
2009,"The existence of closely allied representative species in any two areas,"
2009,"implies, on the theory of descent with modification, that the same"
2009,parent-forms formerly inhabited both areas; and we almost invariably
2009,"find that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas, some"
2009,identical species are still common to both. Wherever many closely allied
2009,"yet distinct species occur, doubtful forms and varieties belonging to"
2009,the same groups likewise occur. It is a rule of high generality that the
2009,inhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest
2009,source whence immigrants might have been derived. We see this in the
2009,striking relation of nearly all the plants and animals of the Galapagos
2009,"Archipelago, of Juan Fernandez, and of the other American islands, to"
2009,the plants and animals of the neighbouring American mainland; and of
2009,"those of the Cape de Verde Archipelago, and of the other African islands"
2009,to the African mainland. It must be admitted that these facts receive no
2009,explanation on the theory of creation.
2009,
2009,"The fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings can"
2009,"be arranged within a few great classes, in groups subordinate to groups,"
2009,and with the extinct groups often falling in between the recent
2009,"groups, is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its"
2009,contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. On these same
2009,principles we see how it is that the mutual affinities of the forms
2009,within each class are so complex and circuitous. We see why certain
2009,characters are far more serviceable than others for classification; why
2009,"adaptive characters, though of paramount importance to the beings, are"
2009,of hardly any importance in classification; why characters derived from
2009,"rudimentary parts, though of no service to the beings, are often of high"
2009,classificatory value; and why embryological characters are often the
2009,"most valuable of all. The real affinities of all organic beings, in"
2009,"contradistinction to their adaptive resemblances, are due to inheritance"
2009,or community of descent. The Natural System is a genealogical
2009,"arrangement, with the acquired grades of difference, marked by the"
2009,"terms, varieties, species, genera, families, etc.; and we have to"
2009,"discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters, whatever"
2009,"they may be, and of however slight vital importance."
2009,
2009,"The similar framework of bones in the hand of a man, wing of a bat,"
2009,"fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse--the same number of vertebrae"
2009,forming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant--and innumerable
2009,"other such facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent"
2009,with slow and slight successive modifications. The similarity of pattern
2009,"in the wing and in the leg of a bat, though used for such different"
2009,"purpose--in the jaws and legs of a crab--in the petals, stamens, and"
2009,"pistils of a flower, is likewise, to a large extent, intelligible on"
2009,"the view of the gradual modification of parts or organs, which were"
2009,aboriginally alike in an early progenitor in each of these classes.
2009,On the principle of successive variations not always supervening at an
2009,"early age, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of"
2009,"life, we clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and"
2009,"fishes should be so closely similar, and so unlike the adult forms. We"
2009,may cease marvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird
2009,"having branchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those of"
2009,a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water by the aid of
2009,well-developed branchiae.
2009,
2009,"Disuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often have reduced"
2009,organs when rendered useless under changed habits or conditions of life;
2009,and we can understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs.
2009,"But disuse and selection will generally act on each creature, when it"
2009,has come to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for
2009,"existence, and will thus have little power on an organ during early"
2009,life; hence the organ will not be reduced or rendered rudimentary at
2009,"this early age. The calf, for instance, has inherited teeth, which never"
2009,"cut through the gums of the upper jaw, from an early progenitor having"
2009,"well-developed teeth; and we may believe, that the teeth in the mature"
2009,"animal were formerly reduced by disuse owing to the tongue and palate,"
2009,"or lips, having become excellently fitted through natural selection to"
2009,"browse without their aid; whereas in the calf, the teeth have been left"
2009,"unaffected, and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages"
2009,have been inherited from a remote period to the present day. On the
2009,view of each organism with all its separate parts having been specially
2009,"created, how utterly inexplicable is it that organs bearing the plain"
2009,"stamp of inutility, such as the teeth in the embryonic calf or the"
2009,"shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of many beetles, should"
2009,so frequently occur. Nature may be said to have taken pains to
2009,"reveal her scheme of modification, by means of rudimentary organs,"
2009,"of embryological and homologous structures, but we are too blind to"
2009,understand her meaning.
2009,
2009,I have now recapitulated the facts and considerations which have
2009,"thoroughly convinced me that species have been modified, during a long"
2009,course of descent. This has been effected chiefly through the natural
2009,"selection of numerous successive, slight, favourable variations; aided"
2009,in an important manner by the inherited effects of the use and disuse
2009,"of parts; and in an unimportant manner, that is, in relation to adaptive"
2009,"structures, whether past or present, by the direct action of external"
2009,"conditions, and by variations which seem to us in our ignorance to arise"
2009,spontaneously. It appears that I formerly underrated the frequency
2009,"and value of these latter forms of variation, as leading to permanent"
2009,modifications of structure independently of natural selection. But as my
2009,"conclusions have lately been much misrepresented, and it has been stated"
2009,that I attribute the modification of species exclusively to natural
2009,"selection, I may be permitted to remark that in the first edition"
2009,"of this work, and subsequently, I placed in a most conspicuous"
2009,"position--namely, at the close of the Introduction--the following words:"
2009,"""I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not the"
2009,"exclusive means of modification."" This has been of no avail. Great is"
2009,the power of steady misrepresentation; but the history of science shows
2009,that fortunately this power does not long endure.
2009,
2009,"It can hardly be supposed that a false theory would explain, in so"
2009,"satisfactory a manner as does the theory of natural selection, the"
2009,several large classes of facts above specified. It has recently been
2009,objected that this is an unsafe method of arguing; but it is a method
2009,"used in judging of the common events of life, and has often been used"
2009,by the greatest natural philosophers. The undulatory theory of light has
2009,thus been arrived at; and the belief in the revolution of the earth on
2009,its own axis was until lately supported by hardly any direct evidence.
2009,It is no valid objection that science as yet throws no light on the far
2009,higher problem of the essence or origin of life. Who can explain what
2009,is the essence of the attraction of gravity? No one now objects
2009,to following out the results consequent on this unknown element of
2009,attraction; notwithstanding that Leibnitz formerly accused Newton of
2009,"introducing ""occult qualities and miracles into philosophy."""
2009,
2009,I see no good reasons why the views given in this volume should shock
2009,"the religious feelings of any one. It is satisfactory, as showing how"
2009,"transient such impressions are, to remember that the greatest discovery"
2009,"ever made by man, namely, the law of the attraction of gravity, was also"
2009,"attacked by Leibnitz, ""as subversive of natural, and inferentially of"
2009,"revealed, religion."" A celebrated author and divine has written to"
2009,"me that ""he has gradually learned to see that it is just as noble a"
2009,conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms
2009,"capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe"
2009,that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by
2009,"the action of His laws."""
2009,
2009,"Why, it may be asked, until recently did nearly all the most eminent"
2009,living naturalists and geologists disbelieve in the mutability of
2009,species? It cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state of nature
2009,are subject to no variation; it cannot be proved that the amount of
2009,variation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity; no clear
2009,"distinction has been, or can be, drawn between species and well-marked"
2009,varieties. It cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are
2009,invariably sterile and varieties invariably fertile; or that sterility
2009,is a special endowment and sign of creation. The belief that species
2009,were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history
2009,of the world was thought to be of short duration; and now that we have
2009,"acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are too apt to assume,"
2009,"without proof, that the geological record is so perfect that it would"
2009,"have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species, if they had"
2009,undergone mutation.
2009,
2009,But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one
2009,"species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are"
2009,always slow in admitting any great changes of which we do not see the
2009,"steps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists,"
2009,when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been
2009,"formed, and great valleys excavated, by the agencies which we still see"
2009,at work. The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of
2009,even a million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of
2009,"many slight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of"
2009,generations.
2009,
2009,Although I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this
2009,"volume under the form of an abstract, I by no means expect to convince"
2009,experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of
2009,"facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view"
2009,directly opposite to mine. It is so easy to hide our ignorance under
2009,"such expressions as the ""plan of creation,"" ""unity of design,"" etc., and"
2009,to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact. Any
2009,one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained
2009,difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts
2009,"will certainly reject the theory. A few naturalists, endowed with"
2009,"much flexibility of mind, and who have already begun to doubt the"
2009,"immutability of species, may be influenced by this volume; but I look"
2009,"with confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will"
2009,be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality. Whoever
2009,is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by
2009,conscientiously expressing his conviction; for thus only can the load of
2009,prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed.
2009,
2009,Several eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that
2009,a multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but
2009,"that other species are real, that is, have been independently created."
2009,This seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. They admit that
2009,"a multitude of forms, which till lately they themselves thought were"
2009,"special creations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of"
2009,"naturalists, and which consequently have all the external characteristic"
2009,features of true species--they admit that these have been produced by
2009,"variation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and slightly"
2009,"different forms. Nevertheless, they do not pretend that they can define,"
2009,"or even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which are"
2009,those produced by secondary laws. They admit variation as a vera causa
2009,"in one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without assigning"
2009,any distinction in the two cases. The day will come when this will
2009,be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived
2009,opinion. These authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of
2009,creation than at an ordinary birth. But do they really believe that at
2009,innumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have
2009,been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? Do they believe
2009,that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were
2009,produced? Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants
2009,"created as eggs or seed, or as full grown? and in the case of mammals,"
2009,were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the
2009,mother's womb? Undoubtedly some of these same questions cannot be
2009,answered by those who believe in the appearance or creation of only a
2009,few forms of life or of some one form alone. It has been maintained
2009,by several authors that it is as easy to believe in the creation of a
2009,"million beings as of one; but Maupertuis' philosophical axiom ""of least"
2009,"action"" leads the mind more willingly to admit the smaller number; and"
2009,certainly we ought not to believe that innumerable beings within each
2009,"great class have been created with plain, but deceptive, marks of"
2009,descent from a single parent.
2009,
2009,"As a record of a former state of things, I have retained in the"
2009,"foregoing paragraphs, and elsewhere, several sentences which imply that"
2009,naturalists believe in the separate creation of each species; and I have
2009,been much censured for having thus expressed myself. But undoubtedly
2009,this was the general belief when the first edition of the present work
2009,appeared. I formerly spoke to very many naturalists on the subject of
2009,"evolution, and never once met with any sympathetic agreement. It is"
2009,"probable that some did then believe in evolution, but they were either"
2009,silent or expressed themselves so ambiguously that it was not easy to
2009,"understand their meaning. Now, things are wholly changed, and almost"
2009,"every naturalist admits the great principle of evolution. There are,"
2009,"however, some who still think that species have suddenly given birth,"
2009,"through quite unexplained means, to new and totally different forms."
2009,"But, as I have attempted to show, weighty evidence can be opposed to the"
2009,admission of great and abrupt modifications. Under a scientific point of
2009,"view, and as leading to further investigation, but little advantage"
2009,is gained by believing that new forms are suddenly developed in an
2009,"inexplicable manner from old and widely different forms, over the old"
2009,belief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth.
2009,
2009,It may be asked how far I extend the doctrine of the modification of
2009,"species. The question is difficult to answer, because the more distinct"
2009,"the forms are which we consider, by so much the arguments in favour of"
2009,community of descent become fewer in number and less in force. But some
2009,arguments of the greatest weight extend very far. All the members of
2009,"whole classes are connected together by a chain of affinities, and all"
2009,"can be classed on the same principle, in groups subordinate to groups."
2009,Fossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide intervals between
2009,existing orders.
2009,
2009,Organs in a rudimentary condition plainly show that an early progenitor
2009,"had the organ in a fully developed condition, and this in some"
2009,cases implies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants.
2009,Throughout whole classes various structures are formed on the same
2009,"pattern, and at a very early age the embryos closely resemble each"
2009,other. Therefore I cannot doubt that the theory of descent with
2009,modification embraces all the members of the same great class or
2009,kingdom. I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or
2009,"five progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number."
2009,
2009,"Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all"
2009,animals and plants are descended from some one prototype. But analogy
2009,may be a deceitful guide. Nevertheless all living things have much in
2009,"common, in their chemical composition, their cellular structure, their"
2009,"laws of growth, and their liability to injurious influences. We see"
2009,this even in so trifling a fact as that the same poison often similarly
2009,affects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly
2009,produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree. With all
2009,"organic beings, excepting perhaps some of the very lowest, sexual"
2009,"reproduction seems to be essentially similar. With all, as far as is at"
2009,"present known, the germinal vesicle is the same; so that all"
2009,organisms start from a common origin. If we look even to the two main
2009,"divisions--namely, to the animal and vegetable kingdoms--certain"
2009,low forms are so far intermediate in character that naturalists have
2009,disputed to which kingdom they should be referred. As Professor Asa Gray
2009,"has remarked, ""the spores and other reproductive bodies of many of the"
2009,"lower algae may claim to have first a characteristically animal, and"
2009,"then an unequivocally vegetable existence."" Therefore, on the principle"
2009,"of natural selection with divergence of character, it does not seem"
2009,"incredible that, from some such low and intermediate form, both animals"
2009,"and plants may have been developed; and, if we admit this, we must"
2009,likewise admit that all the organic beings which have ever lived on this
2009,earth may be descended from some one primordial form. But this inference
2009,"is chiefly grounded on analogy, and it is immaterial whether or not it"
2009,"be accepted. No doubt it is possible, as Mr. G.H. Lewes has urged, that"
2009,at the first commencement of life many different forms were evolved;
2009,"but if so, we may conclude that only a very few have left modified"
2009,"descendants. For, as I have recently remarked in regard to the members"
2009,"of each great kingdom, such as the Vertebrata, Articulata, etc., we have"
2009,"distinct evidence in their embryological, homologous, and rudimentary"
2009,"structures, that within each kingdom all the members are descended from"
2009,a single progenitor.
2009,
2009,"When the views advanced by me in this volume, and by Mr. Wallace or when"
2009,"analogous views on the origin of species are generally admitted, we can"
2009,dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural
2009,history. Systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at
2009,present; but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt
2009,"whether this or that form be a true species. This, I feel sure and I"
2009,"speak after experience, will be no slight relief. The endless disputes"
2009,whether or not some fifty species of British brambles are good species
2009,will cease. Systematists will have only to decide (not that this will be
2009,easy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct from
2009,"other forms, to be capable of definition; and if definable, whether the"
2009,differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific name. This
2009,latter point will become a far more essential consideration than it is
2009,"at present; for differences, however slight, between any two forms,"
2009,"if not blended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most"
2009,naturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species.
2009,
2009,Hereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction
2009,"between species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are"
2009,"known, or believed to be connected at the present day by intermediate"
2009,"gradations, whereas species were formerly thus connected. Hence, without"
2009,rejecting the consideration of the present existence of intermediate
2009,"gradations between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more"
2009,carefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between
2009,them. It is quite possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be
2009,merely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific names; and
2009,in this case scientific and common language will come into accordance.
2009,"In short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those"
2009,"naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial"
2009,combinations made for convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect;
2009,but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered
2009,and undiscoverable essence of the term species.
2009,
2009,The other and more general departments of natural history will rise
2009,"greatly in interest. The terms used by naturalists, of affinity,"
2009,"relationship, community of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive"
2009,"characters, rudimentary and aborted organs, etc., will cease to be"
2009,metaphorical and will have a plain signification. When we no longer look
2009,"at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as something wholly"
2009,beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature
2009,as one which has had a long history; when we contemplate every complex
2009,"structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each"
2009,"useful to the possessor, in the same way as any great mechanical"
2009,"invention is the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason,"
2009,and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each
2009,"organic being, how far more interesting--I speak from experience--does"
2009,the study of natural history become!
2009,
2009,"A grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the"
2009,"causes and laws of variation, on correlation, on the effects of use and"
2009,"disuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so forth."
2009,The study of domestic productions will rise immensely in value. A new
2009,variety raised by man will be a far more important and interesting
2009,subject for study than one more species added to the infinitude of
2009,"already recorded species. Our classifications will come to be, as far as"
2009,"they can be so made, genealogies; and will then truly give what may be"
2009,called the plan of creation. The rules for classifying will no doubt
2009,become simpler when we have a definite object in view. We possess no
2009,pedigree or armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace
2009,"the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by"
2009,characters of any kind which have long been inherited. Rudimentary
2009,organs will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of long-lost
2009,"structures. Species and groups of species which are called aberrant, and"
2009,"which may fancifully be called living fossils, will aid us in forming a"
2009,picture of the ancient forms of life. Embryology will often reveal to us
2009,"the structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes of each great"
2009,class.
2009,
2009,"When we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species,"
2009,"and all the closely allied species of most genera, have, within a not"
2009,"very remote period descended from one parent, and have migrated"
2009,from some one birth-place; and when we better know the many means
2009,"of migration, then, by the light which geology now throws, and will"
2009,"continue to throw, on former changes of climate and of the level of the"
2009,"land, we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable manner"
2009,the former migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world. Even at
2009,"present, by comparing the differences between the inhabitants of the"
2009,"sea on the opposite sides of a continent, and the nature of the various"
2009,inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means of
2009,"immigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography."
2009,
2009,The noble science of geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection
2009,"of the record. The crust of the earth, with its embedded remains, must"
2009,"not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection"
2009,made at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great
2009,fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on an
2009,"unusual occurrence of favourable circumstances, and the blank intervals"
2009,between the successive stages as having been of vast duration. But
2009,we shall be able to gauge with some security the duration of these
2009,intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeding organic
2009,forms. We must be cautious in attempting to correlate as strictly
2009,"contemporaneous two formations, which do not include many identical"
2009,"species, by the general succession of the forms of life. As species are"
2009,"produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes,"
2009,and not by miraculous acts of creation; and as the most important of all
2009,causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered
2009,"and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions, namely, the mutual"
2009,relation of organism to organism--the improvement of one organism
2009,"entailing the improvement or the extermination of others; it follows,"
2009,that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive
2009,"formations probably serves as a fair measure of the relative, though not"
2009,"actual lapse of time. A number of species, however, keeping in a body"
2009,"might remain for a long period unchanged, whilst within the same period,"
2009,"several of these species, by migrating into new countries and coming"
2009,"into competition with foreign associates, might become modified; so"
2009,that we must not overrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of
2009,time.
2009,
2009,In the future I see open fields for far more important researches.
2009,Psychology will be securely based on the foundation already well laid
2009,"by Mr. Herbert Spencer, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental"
2009,power and capacity by gradation. Much light will be thrown on the origin
2009,of man and his history.
2009,
2009,Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view
2009,that each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords
2009,"better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator,"
2009,that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants
2009,"of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those"
2009,determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all
2009,"beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some"
2009,few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian system
2009,"was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the"
2009,"past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its"
2009,unaltered likeness to a distinct futurity. And of the species now living
2009,very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity;
2009,"for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the"
2009,"greater number of species in each genus, and all the species in many"
2009,"genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We"
2009,can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretell that it
2009,"will be the common and widely spread species, belonging to the larger"
2009,"and dominant groups within each class, which will ultimately prevail and"
2009,procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are
2009,the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Cambrian
2009,"epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation"
2009,"has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the"
2009,"whole world. Hence, we may look with some confidence to a secure future"
2009,of great length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the
2009,"good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to"
2009,progress towards perfection.
2009,
2009,"It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many"
2009,"plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various"
2009,"insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth,"
2009,"and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different"
2009,"from each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner,"
2009,"have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in"
2009,"the largest sense, being Growth with reproduction; Inheritance which is"
2009,almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct
2009,"action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of"
2009,"Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence"
2009,"to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the"
2009,"Extinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from"
2009,"famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of"
2009,"conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly"
2009,"follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several"
2009,"powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms"
2009,"or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according"
2009,"to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms"
2009,"most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."
