Abhishek Sinha,asin0080@student.monash.edu,100%,A,I liked the presentation and the detailed analysis this group has done. Plots are nicely presented and customised.

PM's speeches have more focus on national and people.,"I think a plot describing the actual change in gov. policy towards handling covid, maybe case count could have been added. Otherwise a solid presentation. "

Chengzhi Ye,cyee0011@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"There are several unique combinations of figures and shiny package which are refreshing. The form of figure is very good, which makes it easy to understand the meaning of figure.
","There is too much text, so every page of the project is very dense.
Some figures are repeated, and it is not known whether there is a potential purpose. 
When too many months are analyzed together, scale or other packages should be used to bring them together instead of putting all 12 figures on one page."
