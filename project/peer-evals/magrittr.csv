Chengzhi Ye,cyee0011@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"The supplement of tree expression model is crucial to enrich the content and directly raise my score one level. The design of each figure is very original, and shiny is also set well. As the variables change, the results will change accordingly, which is very good.","The topic is a bit boring, because it has been seen many times in this semester. Also when presenting, I don't think everyone is well prepared. "

The navigation for Shiny can be improved， some are hard to select."
Dang Thanh Nguyen,dngu0079@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"I had another connection issues.

The use of flexdashboard and ggplot for Director and Cast analysis just outstanding, I have never thought that I can do that
Overall, movie is not a really interesting subject to me, therefore I don't think I learned any useful information from this","The second speaker speak too fast, it is hard for me to hear him clearly"

Some movies actually make more money domestically than internationally.

Horror movies generated the least revenue compared to other genres.

Did not know that there is a slider function (in the budget and domestic gross options) in flexdashboard.",Research is very extensive and covered various dimensions of movies. Linear model and tree regression model that were used to predict the revenue generated is very interesting.
