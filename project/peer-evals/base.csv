Anthonyseimonlage Dilinie Angela Seimon,asei0003@student.monash.edu,100%,A,The concept of using input fields to plot graphs on demand,"Awesome work! It was a alot of information to take in such a short time though. However, the user guidelines was a brilliant idea to assist the user."
Aryan Jain,ajai0024@student.monash.edu,100%,A,The layout was very functional and pretty. The use of tabs within plots was very smart. The sidebar was also a good insight.,"I was very impressed with the presentation overall, the only thing I felt was as they were only two people, they should have probably used some voice modulation to keep viewers more engaged."

Chengzhi Ye,cyee0011@student.monash.edu,100%,A,"I think the most impressive thing about this group is the use of flexdashboard package or other packages that make the website(Because I am not familiar with that), which is really powerful and professional.","It's not easy for two people to do this. If ask for more requests for them,  I will hope them to have some feelings during the presentation. Don't just say it without any feelings all the time. Also, if the generated figure has more forms, it will make it easier for our audience to understand the theme of the speech."
Cuiping Wei,cwei0018@student.monash.edu,100%,A,Very nice dashboard!,Too much text one one page.

Emily Grace Sheehan,eshe0012@student.monash.edu,100%,A,"I didn't realise the survival rates for stage 1, 2 and 3 were so similar for Breast Cancer.
