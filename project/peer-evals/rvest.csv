Abhishek Sinha,asin0080@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"It was a detailed and an informative presentation on the impact of covid-19 on the education, markets and its rise in countries like USA. I just think, I can be wrong, but some of the graphs and inference sound contradicting. In healthcare, regression model of recovery rate the model doesn't look that accurate to derive inference from. ",It was good presentation and everyone explained their part well.
