Anthonyseimonlage Dilinie Angela Seimon,asei0003@student.monash.edu,100%,A,The plots on the Australian maps was interesting,Amazing work! Loved it!
Aryan Jain,ajai0024@student.monash.edu,100%,A,Learned a lot about the effects of energy consumption and our carbon footprint.,Great work!
Bastiaan Jacques Theo Nabben,bnab0001@student.monash.edu,100%,B,Different energy by source was an eye opener,"Great project, some graphs were very big and detailed"
Brendi Lien Jun Ang,ang0004@student.monash.edu,100%,A,a,Interesting!
Brenwin Lien Jie Ang,ang0005@student.monash.edu,100%,A,Great layout of dashboard,good job!
Chengzhi Ye,cyee0011@student.monash.edu,100%,C,"The use of flexdashboard is very skilled. People can change the year and state to present different results. Although the effect is general, it is very convenient.
","There are too many words, and the process of sorting out the data doesn't need to be displayed for so long, just a simple summary. The legend of figure is not clear."
Cuiping Wei,cwei0018@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"Interesting topics, good analysis.",The labels on some figures are hard to read.
Dang Thanh Nguyen,dngu0079@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"Their subject is cool. However, I do not have a car so I dont learn much from it",I think they did well
Davide Tiziano Signor,dtsig1@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"Since 2008, coal consumption has decreased
Smaller temperature range along the coast 
","The plots with temperature range are very small and hard to see the differences, maybe only show a few years."
Dea Avega Editya,dedi0003@student.monash.edu,100%,C,energy consumption play role in rising temperature in Australia,All speakers are clear. Maybe more on intonation 
Emily Grace Sheehan,eshe0012@student.monash.edu,100%,B,Average temperature increases with energy consumption,"Great presentation.Maybe avoid faceting too many plots, so that they can be easily read and interpreted when presenting."
Helen Evangelina,heva0001@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"Visuals based on temperature
Good data source",Explained visual plots data easily 
Jinghan Zhang,jzha525@student.monash.edu,100%,B,.,.
Jinhao Luo,jluo0015@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"Energy consumption has increased over every year. Meanwhile, the temperature has also increased every year, that might be one of the reason promote energy consumption. ","Nice figures to show the trends, and clear explanations about what you found in the charts."
Joyce Lee,jlee0179@student.monash.edu,100%,B,Integrating map with figures.,Precise analysis.
Junhao Wang,jwan0296@student.monash.edu,100%,B,source code is very handy for other dashboard makers,I think conclusion can be an independent section
Justin Thomas,jtho0048@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"There is a relationship between average temperature and energy consumption. As temperature rises, energy consumption rises. NSW recorded a drop in their energy consumption despite a population increase. This is perhaps due to manufacturing companies using less energy.",They did a great job! Don't have any suggestions on how to improve.
Lachlan Thomas Moody,ltmoo2@student.monash.edu,100%,B,Interesting use of plots and presentation tools,Include different graphics to enhance presentability
Mayunk Bharadwaj,mbha0014@student.monash.edu,100%,B,Coal is trending downwards as a source of energy!!,Was really good; the Temperature ranges map of Victoria over time would've looked really good animated.
Priya Ravindra Dingorkar,pdin0008@student.monash.edu,100%,A,Really informative. Nice graphs,Why did they show the missing 
Putu Wahyu Saputra,psap0002@student.monash.edu,100%,A,How energy consumption is related to temperature. It has a positive relationship.,I enjoyed the presentation especially when they explain about the model and the changes over time
Rui Min Lin,rlin0004@student.monash.edu,100%,B,positive relationship between energy consumption and average temperature,interesting visualisation
Sam Lyubic,slyu0007@student.monash.edu,0%,,,
Sen Wang,swan0165@student.monash.edu,100%,B,Good visualization,Very good.
Siddhant Vaibhav Tirodkar,stir0003@student.monash.edu,100%,A,Great information about energy consumption and Global warming!,"The topic was very interesting and very relevant! Great Job!
"
Varsha Ujjinni Vijay Kumar,vujj0001@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"tempearture range has increased due to global warming, in australia through the years till 2020","good visualisations, with the temperature range through the years as well"
Vinny Vu,vvuu0009@student.monash.edu,100%,B,energy consumption across all states except nsw which decreased due to the reduction from the manufacturing industry ,Use of colour in plots made them more visually appealing and easier to read. some labels could be clearer though if remving the underscores 
Wang Xue,xwan0196@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"great presentation, the plot  is great ",great presentation 
Yan Ma,ymaa0063@student.monash.edu,100%,C,The way they present the summary data is great. And the interactive map is really good.,"The figure in predict part: if change the angle of text, the figure will be more beautiful :)"
Yawen Zhang,yzha0275@student.monash.edu,100%,B,good dashboard format,there are too many words in flexdashboard
Yingtong Ye,yye40@student.monash.edu,33%,B,,
Yiwen Jiang,yjia0021@student.monash.edu,100%,A,good map,Goog
Yiwen Zhang,yzha0633@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"Although the energy consumption in New South Wales decreased, the overall energy consumption in Australia has greatly increased over time.",Good visualization
Yuheng Cui,ycui0008@student.monash.edu,100%,B,temperature changes and how it affects Australia,Great study on temperature topic
Zhiruo Zhang,zzha0001@student.monash.edu,100%,B,They choose a very interesting topic and the analysis is pretty professional. ,"I think except for the graph, they could show us more information or factors which is related to our life. Data analysis should not purely base on the interpretation of the graph. "
