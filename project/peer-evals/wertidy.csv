Chengzhi Ye,cyee0011@student.monash.edu,100%,C,"Many figures use the knowledge learned this semester, which is worth learning.
The content and figure form are also rich.
","Due to the small number of topics, I have no idea what the specific content is about, nor can I judge whether the analysis is reasonable.
There are two people whose background noise is too loud to hear clearly.
When changing people, they don't do it smoothly. Sometimes they suddenly have no voice at all.
