Abhishek Sinha,asin0080@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"Looking at the detailed presentation on the improvement of F1 team's performances, it was clear that three teams have done really well over years in improving their on track performances. Some parameters were left out which I think could have completed this topic.",Not sure really. I think it was good.
Ajay Ganapathy Ajay Ganapathy,agan0012@student.monash.edu,100%,B,"-  deep dive into formula 1

Chengzhi Ye,cyee0011@student.monash.edu,100%,C,"The single figure is clear and well combined with the shiny app. The boy's explanation was very smooth and familiar with the topic.
","Figure of ""the trend of lap speed improvement at circuits from 2010 to 2019"" is not well done. It's too dense to see the difference if it's crowded together.
Except for that boy, other people seem to be not familiar with their own content, do not understand the subject, the speed of explanation is very slow, the analysis is also very limited, and there will be some pauses in the presentation."
